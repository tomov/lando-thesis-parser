ABSTRACT. 
Freezeout transactions, in which a controlling shareholder buys out the minority shareholders, have occurred 
more frequently since the stock market downturn of 2000 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While freezeouts 
were historically executed as statutory mergers, recent Delaware case law facilitates a new mechanism - 
freezeout via tender offer-by eliminating entire fairness review for these transactions. This Article identifies two 
social welfare costs of the current doctrinal regime. First, the tender-offer-freezeout mechanism facilitates some 
inefficient (value-destroying) transactions by allowing the controller to exploit asymmetric information against the 
minority. Second, the merger-freezeout mechanism deters some efficient (value-increasing) transactions because 
of the special committee's veto power against the deal. These negative wealth effects are unlikely to be resolved 
through private contracting between the controller and the minority in the corporate charter. Rather than 
advocating patchwork reforms to correct these problems, this Article proposes a return to first principles of 
corporate law in the freezeout context. The result of this re-grounding would be a convergence in judicial 
standards of review for freezeouts and the elimination of the efficiency loss that is inherent in the existing 
doctrine. 
INTRODUCTION 
On August 2, 2004, Barbara Cox Anthony and Anne Cox Chambers, who together owned a 62% equity interest 
and a 73% voting interest in Cox Communications, announced that they would offer $32 cash per share in a 
"freezeout"1 of the Cox minority shareholders.2 The offer represented a 16% premium over the 
preannouncement trading price for Cox, or $7.9 billion in total value.3 Cox formed a special committee (SC) of 
three independent directors to review the offer and negotiate with the Cox sisters' representatives.4 Minority 
shareholders sued alleging that the offer price was unfair.5 Over the following four months, the SC bargained 
hard: counteroffering at $38 per share, walking away from the table at several points, and finally agreeing to a 
deal at $34.75 per share, representing a 26% premium over the pre-offer price.6 The deal closed on December 8, 
2004.7 
One month later, on January 10, 2005, News Corporation, controlled by publishing magnate Rupert Murdoch, 
announced a freezeout exchange offer for the 18% of Fox Entertainment Group that it did not already own.8 The 
proposed ratio of 1.9 News shares for each Fox share represented a 7.4% premium over the preannouncement 
trading price for Fox, or $6.0 billion in total value.9 As in the Cox freezeout, Fox formed an SC of independent 
directors to review the offer,10 and plaintiffs' counsel filed suit alleging that the offer price was unfair to the 
minority. However, in contrast to the Cox freezeout, News stated that it might go forward with the transaction even 
if the Fox SC did not approve the offer.11 On January 24, the Fox SC issued a statement taking no position on 
the News offer, explaining that it needed more time.12 On March 4, News raised its offer to 2.04 News shares per 
Fox share, or a 17.6% premium over the preannouncement trading price for Fox.13 On March 7, the SC 
approved the revised offer,14 and the deal closed on March 22, 2005.15 
As the Cox Communications and Fox Entertainment Group examples illustrate, freezeouts are back. Due at 
least in part to the stock market decline of 2000 and the additional costs imposed on public companies under the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,16 freezeout activity in the United States has increased to more than twice its 
historical levels: 128 announced transactions in the four years between July 2001 and July 2005 (32 per year, on 
average),17 compared to 154 freezeouts during the ten years between 1987 and 1996 (15 per year, on 
average).18 At the same time that freezeout activity has been increasing, the Delaware courts have established 
different standards of judicial review for the two ways of freezing out minority shareholders. The traditional route, 
known as a statutory merger freezeout, mandates an SC with veto power over the deal, followed by stringent 
"entire fairness" review by the courts. The Cox sisters (or, more accurately, their legal advisors) chose this

Page 6 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
transactional form for the Cox Communications freezeout. The new route, known as a tender offer freezeout, 
does not give the SC veto power and, at least as of mid-2001, is subject only to deferential business judgment 
review by the courts. News Corporation chose this transactional form for the Fox Entertainment freezeout. 
These procedural differences have substantive implications. Examining the outcomes of all freezeouts in the 
current doctrinal regime, I find that minority shareholders received less in tender offer freezeouts than in merger 
freezeouts, as measured by premiums over preannouncement stock prices.19 This finding is illustrated 
dramatically by the Cox and Fox examples above: If the Fox minority shareholders had received the same 26.0% 
premium that the Cox minority shareholders received (rather than their actual 17.6%), they would have achieved 
an additional $504 million in total consideration from News Corporation. 
Commentators have debated the wisdom of doctrinal contours that create procedural and substantive differences 
based on choice of transactional form, and several have advocated convergence toward a single judicial 
approach to freezeouts.20 The need for change has nevertheless remained unclear because of the possibility for 
adjustments in ex ante pricing of a minority stake. This Article makes the case for change by identifying two social 
welfare costs of the current regime. First, the tender-offer-freezeout mechanism facilitates some inefficient 
(value-destroying) transactions by allowing the controller to exploit asymmetric information against the minority. 
second, the merger-freezeout mechanism deters some efficient (value-increasing) transactions because of the 
SC's power to veto the deal. Tender-offer-freezeout doctrine goes too far, and merger-freezeout doctrine does not 
go far enough, in facilitating freezeouts. Put another way, some companies that should not "go private" do, while 
others that should do not. As a result, there is a suboptimal distribution of companies between public and private 
status. 
After identifying this efficiency loss, this Article proposes specific doctrinal adjustments that would fix freezeouts. 
Rather than propose a patchwork solution, this Article advocates a return to first principles of corporate law in the 
freezeout context. The objective is to replicate the elements of an arms-length negotiation - namely, disinterested 
board approval and disinterested shareholder approval - in the freezeout context. Translating the arms-length 
standard to the freezeout arena requires, first, meaningful approval by an SC of independent directors; and 
second, approval by a majority of the minority shareholders. When both of these procedural protections are 
provided, this Article proposes that courts should apply deferential business judgment review to assess the 
transaction. If either or both of these protections are absent, this Article proposes that courts should step in to 
scrutinize the transaction under the entire fairness standard. The result of this re-grounding would be 
convergence in standards of judicial review for freezeouts and elimination of the efficiency loss inherent in the 
existing doctrine. 
The remainder of this Article proceeds as follows. Part I provides a brief history of freezeout doctrine, beginning 
with the Delaware Supreme Court's landmark decision Weinberger v. UOP in 1983, and tracing the evolution of 
this doctrine through Kahn v. Lynch Communication Systems, Solomon v. Pathe Communications, and the 
combination of In re Siliconix Inc. Shareholders Litigation, Glassman v. Unocal Exploration Corp., and In re Pure 
Resources, Inc. Shareholders Litigation in 2001-2002. Part I also summarizes the literature to date examining this 
latest doctrinal contour and demonstrates that the case for change has remained unclear. Part II identifies an 
efficiency loss that arises in the current doctrinal regime. With the case for change thus clarified, Part III puts 
forward my proposal for reform. 
I. BACKGROUND 
A. Historical Origins of Freezeouts 
Until the 1920s, minority shareholders had a property interest in the corporation that allowed them to hold out 
against a controlling shareholder's efforts to freeze them out.21 While Florida enacted the first cash-out merger 
statute in the mid-1920s,22 freezeouts only became commonplace when Delaware in the 1950s, and the Model 
Business Corporation Act in the 1960s, adopted similar cash-out statutes.23 These laws provided the statutory 
merger mechanism for freezing out minority shareholders, which remains the most common procedure today.24 
In a merger freezeout, the controlling shareholder establishes a wholly owned corporation; the target board 
(typically dominated by the controller) approves the merger; and the shareholders of the target (again, dominated 
by the controller) approve the transaction.25 Under the terms of the merger, the minority shareholders receive 
either cash or the controller's stock in exchange for their shares in the target.26 The transaction is executed as a 
statutory merger under section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or analogous provisions in other 
states. 
Delaware courts quickly established that freezeouts would be subject to judicial review for entire fairness to the 
minority shareholders.27 The application of entire fairness review to freezeouts was unremarkable, as it is 
consistent with the Delaware courts' general approach to self-dealing transactions.28 The situation became more

interesting in the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, when the level of freezeout activity increased at the same 
time that the stock market experienced substantial declines.29 Concerns emerged that controlling shareholders 
were taking advantage of fire-sale prices to eliminate powerless minority shareholders.30 In a much-publicized 
speech given at the University of Notre Dame in November 1974, SEC Commissioner A.A. Sommer said: 
Daily we read of companies which are offering to buy out all, or substantially all, of their shareholders, thus 
enhancing the control of the controlling shareholders and freeing the corporation of the "burdens" of being 
publicly-held. In other instances clever and indeed most imaginative devices are used to afford the small 
shareholders little, if any, choice in the matter. What is happening is, in my estimation, serious, unfair, and 
sometimes disgraceful, a perversion of the whole process of public financing, and a course that inevitably is going 
to make the individual shareholder even more hostile to American corporate mores and the securities markets 
than he already is.31 
The SEC responded to the perceived problem with the promulgation of Rule 136-3 in 1979.32 Under this Rule, a 
controlling shareholder must make extensive disclosures to the minority in conjunction with a freezeout 
transaction-including the purpose of the transaction (and why alternative methods for achieving the same purpose 
were rejected),33 a summary of the investment banker's fairness opinion,34 and financial information such as 
current and historical market prices35-in order to facilitate an informed decision by minority shareholders. 
While the SEC focused on disclosure, the Delaware courts, in a more gradual movement, established procedural 
protections for minority shareholders. I will now examine the evolution of this case law, which took place during 
the 1980s and 1990s. 
B. Development of Procedural Protections 
1. Weinberger v. UOP 
The seminal case on freezeouts in the modern era is Weinberger v. UOP,36 handed down by the Delaware 
Supreme Court in 1983. Weinberger involved a freezeout of UOP's minority shareholders by its 50.5% 
shareholder, Signal Companies. Minority shareholders brought suit alleging that the price paid, $21 per share in 
cash, was not fair to them. The Delaware Chancery Court held for the defendant directors, who were affiliated 
with both UOP and Signal.37 The Delaware Supreme Court reversed, finding that the deal process did not meet 
the entire fairness standard, and remanded the case to the chancery court for an inquiry into the fair value of the 
minority shares.38 
While Weinberger did several notable things,39 for present purposes its most important contribution was the 
identification of the procedural protections that minority shareholders should receive in freezeout mergers. The 
Court began by noting that entire fairness review required both "fair dealing" and "fair price," and clarified what 
each of these entailed: 
[Fair dealing] embraces questions of when the transaction was timed, how it was initiated, structured, negotiated, 
disclosed to the directors, and how the approvals of the directors and the stockholders were obtained. [Fair price] 
relates to the economic and financial considerations of the proposed merger, including all relevant factors . . . . 
However, the test for fairness is not a bifurcated one as between fair dealing and price. All aspects of the issue 
must be examined as a whole since the question is one of entire fairness.40 
In assessing the transaction at hand, the court found several aspects problematic under this standard. First, the 
court criticized the fact that a valuation report prepared by two officers of Signal, who were also directors of UOP, 
was shared only with the Signal board and not with UOP.41 This report was "of obvious significance to both 
Signal and UOP"42 because it indicated that any price up to $24 per share (14% higher than the $21 per share 
that was actually paid) would have been a good investment for Signal. Second, the court noted the casualness of 
the fairness opinion rendered by Lehman Brothers to the UOP board.43 Among other deficiencies, the Lehman 
partner seemed to have reviewed the opinion only on the flight to the UOP board meeting, and, even at this late 
stage, the actual price being assessed by Lehman had been left blank.44 Finally, the Court criticized James 
Crawford, President and CEO of UOP, for failing to negotiate in response to Signal's first offer of $21.45 
But in the midst of its litany of criticisms of Signal's freezeout process, the Weinberger court paused to provide 
crucial guidance for transactional lawyers. In a much-noticed footnote, the court stated: 
Although perfection is not possible, or expected, the result here could have been entirely different if UOP had 
appointed an independent negotiating committee of its outside directors to deal with Signal at arm's length. Since 
fairness in this context can be equated to conduct by a theoretical, wholly independent, board of directors acting 
upon the matter before them, it is unfortunate that this course apparently was neither considered nor pursued.

Particularly in a parent-subsidiary context, a showing that the action taken was as though each of the contending 
parties had in fact exerted its bargaining power against the other at arm's length is strong evidence that the 
transaction meets the test of fairness.46 
Transactional lawyers took the hint: An SC of independent directors quickly became standard practice in 
freezeout mergers.47 
Two opposing concerns developed in response to the Weinberger SC mechanism. The first, voiced primarily by 
judges and academics, is that an SC can never be truly independent from the controlling shareholder because the 
controller is an "800-pound gorilla"48 who inevitably will dominate the independent directors.49 Among those who 
hold this view, some (generally academics) conclude that SCs should not warrant significant deference from the 
courts as suggested by Weinberger,50 while others (generally judges) conclude that, even if soft ties exist 
between the controller and the SC, at least some judicial deference to an SC process is warranted because 
courts are not well-positioned to assess questions of value.51 
The second concern, diametrically opposite from the first and voiced primarily by practitioners, is that SCs are too 
independent from the controller. As described by Charles Nathan, global co-chair of the mergers and acquisitions 
group at Latham & Watkins: "There are a number of times the committee turns down perfectly fine deals, or drags 
things out for months, because they can't get their act together. And it's a very, very frustrating experience."52 
Under this view, the Weinberger SC roadmap actually works to the detriment of minority shareholders by allowing 
independent directors with imperfect incentives to veto Pareto-improving transactions. 
2. Kahn v. Lynch Communication Systems 
In the years following Weinberger, these opposing views on the wisdom and efficacy of SCs, invoking 
fundamental questions of human nature and organizational behavior, manifested themselves in the Delaware 
courts as a narrow, but crucial, legal question: What level of deference should courts afford to a freezeout merger 
that was approved by an SC of independent directors? Footnote 7 of Weinberger was vague on this critical 
question. In the absence of guidance, judges on the Delaware Chancery Court divided in their approaches in the 
late 1980s and early 1990s. In In re Trans World Airlines, Inc. Shareholders Litigation, for example, Chancellor 
Bill Allen held that SC approval changed the standard of review for a freezeout merger from entire fairness to 
highly deferential business judgment review.53 In contrast, in Citron v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co.54 and 
Rabkin v. Olin Corp.,55 Vice Chancellors Jack Jacobs and Bill Chandler, respectively, held that SC approval only 
shifted the burden on entire fairness review from the defendant to the plaintiff. 
These competing approaches were reconciled by the Delaware Supreme Court eleven years after Weinberger in 
Kahn v. Lynch Communication Systems.56 Lynch involved a freezeout of the minority shareholders in Lynch 
Communications by Lynch's controlling shareholder, Alcatel. Following the Weinberger roadmap, the Lynch board 
established an SC of independent directors to negotiate with Alcatel.57 Unlike the UOP representatives in 
Weinberger, the Lynch SC was not spineless: Alcatel proposed $14 per share in cash; the Lynch SC 
counter-offered $17; Alcatel responded with offers of $15, $15.25, and then a "final offer" of $15.50, all rejected 
by the Lynch SC.58 To break the stalemate, Alcatel informed the SC that it was "'ready to proceed with an 
unfriendly tender [directly to the minority shareholders] at a lower price' if the $15.50 per share price was not 
recommended."59 In the face of this threat, the Lynch SC caved and unanimously recommended approval of the 
$15.50 offer.60 
Minority shareholders in Lynch brought suit seeking entire fairness review. The chancery court entered judgment 
for the defendants Alcatel and Lynch Communications,61 and the plaintiffs appealed. The Delaware Supreme 
Court reversed on the grounds that the Lynch SC did not have the "power to say no" when faced with Alcatel's 
tender offer threat.62 The court remanded the case to the Delaware Chancery Court with the burden on the 
defendants to demonstrate the entire fairness of the transaction.63 
One of the interesting features in Lynch is that Alcatel did not threaten to execute a statutory merger unilaterally - 
which it had the legal ability to do because it controlled Lynch's board - but only threatened to go directly to the 
minority shareholders through a tender offer. Because Alcatel held only 43% of the Lynch shares, it would have 
needed 83% support from the minority shareholders (47% out of the remaining 57%) to achieve the 90% control 
that would then have allowed a short-form back-end merger.64 Therefore, Alcatel's "threat" was nothing more 
than an invocation of Alcatel's otherwise legal walkaway alternative, in which Alcatel would have had to achieve 
overwhelming support from the minority in order to be successful. The Lynch court ignored this point, making 
clear the extent to which a controller must behave nicely in its negotiations with the SC. 
And what exactly does the controller get from behaving nicely? Here too the Lynch court provided an unsatisfying 
answer from the controller's perspective. Lynch resolved the two strands of Delaware Chancery Court cases

Page 9 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
noted above by holding that even a pristine SC process only shifts the burden of proof to the plaintiff on entire 
fairness review.65 Thus, Lynch implicitly endorses the view that independent directors cannot be truly 
independent from the controlling shareholder, and that courts still need to scrutinize freezeout transactions for 
entire fairness because of the inability to replicate an armslength process between the controlling shareholder 
and the SC. 
3. Rosenblatt v. Getty Oil 
One could argue that while an SC may be captured by the controller, the minority shareholders cannot be, and 
therefore greater judicial deference should be afforded to approval by a majority of the minority shareholders (a 
"MOM condition").66 Whatever appeal this argument may have as a matter of logic, the Delaware courts have 
rejected it, choosing instead to afford only minimal deference to MOM conditions. The seminal case on this point 
is Rosenblatt v. Getty Oil Co.,67 handed down by the Delaware Supreme Court just two years after Weinberger. 
Rosenblatt involved the 1976 freezeout of the minority shareholders in Skelly Oil Company, which was 80% 
owned (directly and through a subsidiary) by Getty Oil.68 In this deal, extensive negotiations took place between 
Harold Berg, Getty's Chief Operating Officer, and James Hara, President of Skelly. Because the deal was a 
pre-Weinberger transaction, before the benefits of the SC route were made clear, Skelly did not form an SC, even 
though Skelly had several independent directors on its board. Berg and Hara agreed to an exchange ratio of 
0.5875 Getty shares for each Skelly share.69 The Skelly board approved the deal and submitted it to a 
shareholder vote. Although the deal did not expressly contain a MOM condition, 89% of the voting Skelly minority 
shares, representing 58% of all minority shares, approved the transaction.70 
The deal closed, and minority shareholders brought a fairness claim in the Delaware Chancery Court. The 
chancery court found the deal to be fair to the minority shareholders, and the plaintiffs appealed. In affirming the 
chancery court, the Delaware Supreme Court held that approval by the minority shareholders shifted the burden 
on entire fairness to the plaintiff but did not shift the standard of review to business judgment.71 This case, like 
Lynch nine years later, illustrates the Delaware Supreme Court's unwillingness to relinquish entire fairness review 
regardless of the procedural protections that the controller provides. 
Today, one puzzling (if unintended) consequence of the Rosenblatt and Lynch combination is that either SC 
approval or a MOM condition shifts the burden on entire fairness review, but the combination of the two 
procedural protections provides no further benefit to the controlling shareholder in terms of standards of judicial 
review. Empirically, the vast majority of controllers in my sample of post-Siliconix merger freezeouts (eighty out of 
eighty-five, or 94%) went through an SC process.72 With the burden thus shifted through a well-functioning SC, 
controllers have no further incentive to provide a MOM condition. Consistent with this prediction, I find that only 
one-third (eighteen out of fifty-five) of the merger freezeouts in my sample included a MOM condition.73 
To summarize, while Weinberger provides the procedural roadmap for freezeout transactions, Lynch limits the 
benefits of this route by requiring a "Caesar's wife" SC process, and Lynch and Rosenblatt together hold that 
even an SC/MOM combination does not eliminate entire fairness review. From a transactional lawyer's 
perspective, merger-freezeout doctrine after Lynch and Rosenblatt represents the worst of all possible worlds: a 
fully empowered SC and a feisty negotiation with the controller, to be followed nevertheless with entire fairness 
review by the court, even if minority shareholders have approved the deal.74 Of course, the potential 
beneficiaries of this approach are the minority shareholders, who should gain from both the procedural 
protections that Weinberger encourages and the judicial scrutiny that Lynch and Rosenblatt mandate. 
In effect, the Weinberger-to-Rosenblatt-to-Lynch trajectory represents the Delaware courts' gradual approach to 
the problem of inadequate minority shareholder protections that presented itself in the 1970s. This gradual 
trajectory would be disrupted by the Siliconix and Glassman combination in 2001. I now turn to this latest doctrinal 
contour. 
C. Disruptive Technology: The Tender Offer Freezeout 
A statutory merger is not the only way to execute a freezeout; it can also be executed through a reverse stock 
split or an asset acquisition, though these methods are rare in practice.75 Another method that began to appear 
in the 1990s was a freezeout via tender offer. In this route, the controlling shareholder would begin, or announce 
its intention to begin, a tender offer directly to the minority shareholders. The target would form an SC of 
independent directors to assess the transaction, negotiate with the controller, and issue a Schedule 14D-9 
recommendation to the minority (e.g., approve, reject, neutral, or unable to take a position). If the controller 
gained sufficient shares in its tender offer to get to 90% voting control of the target, it would then execute a 
short-form merger, which does not require a shareholder vote, in order to eliminate the remaining (nontendering) 
minority shareholders.76 Because 90% is the critical threshold in a tender offer freezeout, the controller would 
typically condition its offer on getting to 90% control (a "90% condition").

1. Solomon v. Pathe Communications 
Historically, practitioners assumed that tender offer freezeouts would also be subject to entire fairness review, 
because they achieved the same end result as merger freezeouts, namely, the elimination of the minority 
shareholders.77 As a result there was no obvious benefit to be gained from a tender offer freezeout, and the 
merger form continued to dominate in practice. This calculus began to change in the mid-1990s with the 
Delaware Supreme Court's decision in Solomon v. Pathe Communications Corp.78 The Solomon court affirmed a 
chancery court holding that a tender offer by a controlling shareholder to the minority was not subject to entire 
fairness review.79 The court reasoned that a tender offer was a deal between the controlling shareholder and 
minority shareholders, which involved no conflict of interest.80 
Because the tender offer was for less than all the minority shares, Solomon was not a freezeout situation, and 
could easily have been limited to its facts. Practitioners nevertheless read the tea leaves of Solomon to suggest 
that a tender offer freezeout might not be subject to entire fairness review.82 But even if this interpretation were 
correct, it was not clear that a controlling shareholder could avoid entire fairness review in the back-end 
short-form merger that would be necessary to complete the freezeout.83 As a result of this doctrinal uncertainty, 
practitioners continued to stay away from tender offer freezeouts in favor of the traditional merger route. 
2. In re Siliconix Inc. Shareholders Litigation 
The test case on the front-end tender offer came five years after Solomon, in In re Siliconix Inc. Shareholders 
Litigation.84 Siliconix involved Vishay Intertechnology's freezeout of the minority shareholders in Siliconix. Vishay, 
which owned 80.4% of Siliconix, announced a tender offer for the minority shares at $28.82 cash per share.85 
With Vishay's encouragement, Siliconix appointed an SC of two independent directors to negotiate with Vishay.86 
The SC hired legal and financial advisors and concluded that the offer price was inadequate.87 After three 
months of negotiations, Vishay switched from a cash tender offer to a stock exchange offer at a ratio of 1.5 
Vishay shares for every Siliconix share.88 Minority shareholders brought suit alleging that the exchange ratio 
being offered was unfair. Citing Solomon, among other cases, the Delaware Chancery Court declined to apply 
entire fairness review to the tender offer freezeout: "Because . . . there were no disclosure violations and the 
tender is not coercive, Vishay was not obligated to offer a fair price in its tender."89 
3. Glassman v. Unocal Exploration 
Just one month after Siliconix, the Delaware Supreme Court provided an answer on the remaining piece, the 
back-end short-form merger. In Glassman v. Unocal Exploration Corp.,90 handed down in July 2001, the parent 
company Unocal Corporation (Unocal) owned 96% of its subsidiary Unocal Exploration Corporation (UXC).91 
Unocal decided to freeze out the minority shareholders, and UXC appointed an SC of three directors to negotiate 
the terms of the deal.92 The parties negotiated an exchange ratio of 0.54 Unocal shares for each UXC share, 
and, because Unocal held more than 90% of UXC, the freezeout was executed as a short-form merger under 
section 253 of the Delaware corporate code.93 
Minority shareholders brought suit alleging that the transaction was unfair. The Delaware Chancery Court 
declined to apply entire fairness review and dismissed the claim.94 The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed, 
holding that "absent fraud or illegality, appraisal is the exclusive remedy available to a minority shareholder who 
objects to a short-form merger."95 The court reasoned that section 253 was intended to provide a streamlined 
process for accomplishing a merger, which is squarely at odds with the procedural apparatus that the fair process 
prong of entire fairness requires: "If . . . the corporate fiduciary sets up negotiating committees, hires independent 
financial and legal experts, etc., then it will have lost the very benefit provided by the statute - a simple, fast and 
inexpensive process for accomplishing a merger."96 
Thus, with Glassman, the other shoe had dropped, and practitioners now had a blueprint for avoiding entire 
fairness review in a freezeout transaction. Under Siliconix, a tender offer to the minority would be exempt from 
entire fairness review, and if the controller got to 90% voting control, the back-end short-form merger would also 
be exempt under Glassman. Practitioners,97 academics,98 and judges99 quickly noted the disparity in judicial 
treatment between tender offer freezeouts and merger freezeouts. At the same time that Lynch refused to 
abandon entire fairness review, even with a well-functioning SC process, Siliconix/Glassman readily deferred to 
the unilateral action of the controlling shareholder. The result was dramatically different standards of review for 
two functionally identical transactional forms. 
4. In re Pure Resources 
In re Pure Resources Shareholder Litigation,100 the most recent doctrinal development on freezeouts, begins to 
address this disparity. Pure Resources involved Unocal Exploration (again) tendering for the 35% of Pure

Page 11 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Resources that it did not own. Minority shareholders (again) brought suit alleging unfairness. After an extensive 
discussion of the "two strands of authority that answer these questions differently,"101 Vice Chancellor Leo 
Strine, following Solomon, declined to apply entire fairness review to Unocal's freezeout tender offer.102 
However, in a clear effort to close some of the gap between the two doctrinal strands, Vice Chancellor Strine 
noted that the Solomon exemption from entire fairness review only applied to tender offers that were noncoercive 
to the minority.103 The court seized on this qualification to establish three procedural conditions that must be met 
in order for a tender offer to be noncoercive: (1) the offer must be subject to a nonwaivable MOM condition; (2) 
the controller must guarantee to consummate a prompt short-form merger at the same price if it obtains 90% or 
more of the shares; and (3) the controller must make no "retributive threats" in its negotiations with the SC.104 
The Pure Resources court confirmed, however, that if these conditions were met then a tender offer freezeout 
would not be subject to entire fairness review. 
5. Synthesis 
To summarize, Delaware law currently offers a controlling shareholder two transactional forms for a freezeout: the 
statutory merger route and the tender offer route. These two forms appear similar at the outset. In each case the 
process begins when the controller informs the target board of its intention to freeze out the minority, and the 
target board responds by establishing an SC of independent directors. But at this point the similarity disappears. 
While the SC in a merger freezeout has veto power over the transaction and in theory can negotiate indefinitely, 
the SC in a tender offer freezeout cannot veto the transaction and has only ten days to issue its 140-9 
recommendation to the minority. The difference continues in the standard of judicial review imposed: entire 
fairness review for merger freezeouts compared to business judgment review for tender offer freezeouts. Perhaps 
not surprisingly in view of this procedural divergence, the substantive outcomes differ significantly as well: 
Controlling shareholders pay less to the minority, on average, in tender offer freezeouts than in merger 
freezeouts.105 I now review the academic and practitioner commentary that has developed in response to this 
state of play. 
D. Prior Literature 
Commentators have divided on the Weinberger-to-Pure Resources line of cases. These responses can be 
divided into three categories: those who advocate convergence in standards of judicial review by subjecting 
tender offer freezeouts to entire fairness review; those who defend the status quo; and those who propose hybrid 
approaches. This Section summarizes and assesses each of these positions in turn. 
1. Advocating Entire Fairness Review for Tender Offer Freezeouts 
At one end of the spectrum, some commentators argue for doctrinal convergence through entire fairness review 
for tender offer freezeouts on the grounds of doctrinal coherence.106 Although this simple solution has some 
superficial appeal, there are two problems with it. First, it does not take into account the costs of judicial 
intervention. Because courts are not well positioned to engage in the difficult task of valuation, entire fairness 
review should be deployed sparingly. In fact, part of the explanation for the dramatic doctrinal gap between Lynch 
(a Delaware Supreme Court decision) and Siliconix (a Delaware chancery court decision) may be the fact that 
chancery judges "personally face the daunting task of valuation" and, therefore, may be "institutionally inclined to 
avoid it wherever they can do so responsibly."107 This aspect of judicial realism suggests that the simple solution 
of applying entire fairness review may not adequately account for institutional realities and may introduce judicial 
costs that outweigh the benefits of doctrinal convergence. 
Second, and more importantly, entire fairness review for all freezeouts does not necessarily follow from the 
general argument in favor of doctrinal convergence. The argument for convergence "up" focuses on providing 
adequate procedural protections to minority shareholders, but an important counterargument is that entire 
fairness review for all freezeouts may deter some value-creating transactions. In an important article published 
just before Siliconix, two sitting Vice-Chancellors and a former Chancellor proposed convergence "down" to 
business judgment review for all freezeouts that received SC approval, in effect proposing a reconsideration of 
the rule in Lynch.108 The question of convergence "up" or convergence "down" cannot be resolved on a 
theoretical level. But at the very least it is clear that arguments for convergence only invite the larger question of 
convergence to what. Commentators who support entire fairness review for all freezeouts do not adequately 
address this issue. 
2. Defending the Status Quo 
A second group of commentators defend the doctrinal contour that Siliconix and Glassman establish.109 These 
commentators put forward three arguments in support of this view. The first is formalistic: Delaware corporate law 
provides an important role for a target board in a statutory merger but no role for the board in a tender offer.

Page 12 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Therefore, judicial scrutiny of a tender offer is not warranted because there is no corporate action. This argument 
was central to the court's reasoning in Siliconix: "[T]ender offers essentially represent the sale of shareholders' 
separate property and such sales -even when aggregated into a single change in control transaction-require no 
'corporate' action and do not involve distinctively 'corporate' interests."110 
The problem with this argument, as noted by academics111 and even other chancery court judges,112 is that it 
ignores one of the most important strands of Delaware corporate law of the past twenty years, which is precisely 
about articulating the board's role in a tender offer: the degree to which a target board may adopt defensive 
measures against a hostile tender offer.113 Thus, this argument creates a tension, if not outright contradiction, 
between the board's role in freezeout tender offers (none) and the board's role in hostile tender offers 
(substantial). If the distinguishing feature is the nature of the bidder (controlling shareholder versus hostile 
bidder), then it would seem that minority shareholders should receive more protection in the freezeout case, 
rather than less, because in a freezeout there is no market check on the bidder's actions.114 
A second argument made by proponents of the status quo is that minority shareholders have adequate protection 
from coercive or inadequate tender offers from their tender decision itself.115 Again, this theory was offered as 
part of the rationale in Siliconix: "[A] s long as the tender offer is pursued properly, the free choice of the minority 
shareholders to reject the tender offer provides sufficient protection.116 The problem with this argument is that it 
is inconsistent with my empirical evidence, which shows that minority shareholders receive less in tender offer 
freezeouts than in merger freezeouts. This finding is further supported by practitioner impressions that the binary 
choice of a tender decision is not a substitute for vigorous bargaining by an SC. As described by Jim Morphy, 
head of the mergers and acquisitions practice at Sullivan & Cromwell in New York City: 
In a tender offer the controlling stockholder, in effect, says to the other stockholders, "Here is my offer: the stock 
was trading at $6.25, I'm willing to pay you $8.00. That's your choice -you can have $8.00 or you can have $6.25." 
Because it is difficult for stockholders, as a group, to bargain collectively, the tendency if you are a stockholder is 
to take the $8.00. Someone might have a mathematical analysis of how this all works but that is essentially what 
takes place in the absence of an effective bargaining agent like a special committee. In the merger scenario, 
given the difference in statutory and legal standards, the special committee is not as easily by-passed by the 
controlling stockholder. Therefore its choice is not between $6.25 and $8.00. Armed with information and 
sufficient authority, it can go out and negotiate for something better.117 
In short, both empirical evidence and practitioner impressions reject the view that minority shareholders have 
adequate protections in freezeout tender offers, at least as measured against the benchmark of the freezeout 
merger process. 
The final argument put forward in defense of the status quo is less easily dismissed. In a standard, yet important, 
law-and-economics move, Adam Pritchard points out that the arrival of tender offer freezeouts will, at most, create 
a one-time wealth transfer from minority shareholders to the controller.118 Going forward, minority shareholders 
will simply pay less for a minority stake knowing that they may get frozen out at a lower price sometime in the 
future. Therefore, from an ex ante perspective, Siliconix does not influence the distribution of gains between 
minority shareholders and the controller; by extension, Siliconix will have no effect on allocational efficiency. 
This is a simple but powerful argument, one that commentators in favor of doctrinal convergence have not 
addressed. Nevertheless, there are some problems with it. Pritchard overstates the simplicity of the ex ante 
calculation by assuming that all, or virtually all, practitioners have shifted to the tender offer mechanism for 
freezing out minority shareholders in the aftermath of Siliconix and Glassman. Indeed, this assumption has found 
strong support among academics,119 practitioner-oriented journals,120 and even practitioners themselves.121 If 
this assumption were correct, then the ex ante price adjustment would be an estimate of the lower price that 
minority shareholders would expect to receive in a tender offer freezeout relative to a merger freezeout, 
discounted for time value and likelihood of freezeout. In reality, however, the fact that two-thirds of freezeouts are 
still executed through the merger route122 introduces another probability that must be factored into the analysis, 
namely, the likelihood that the controlling shareholder will proceed via tender offer rather than merger. This 
probability may be particularly difficult to estimate if it is a moving target - for example, due to gradual shifts in 
legal guidance on transactional forms. 
But the argument that an ex ante pricing adjustment is complicated does not refute Pritchard's basic claim that it 
is possible. As long as there is no reason to believe that the marketplace will misestimate any of the relevant 
pieces of the calculation in a systematically biased way, the pricing mechanism should, on average, compensate 
minority shareholders fairly, which is all that is needed to address equity concerns and preserve allocational 
efficiency in the marketplace. Moreover, the increased risk that arises from the controller's choice of transactional 
form (or, more precisely, the increased volatility of returns for minority shareholders due to the possibility of a

Page 13 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
merger freezeout) should not depress the value of a minority stake because this is a firm-specific (unsystematic) 
risk that does not get priced in the capital-asset pricing model.123 
A different, but also potentially problematic assumption inherent in Pritchard's ex ante pricing story is that Siliconix 
constitutes "public" information that will be reflected in market pricing under the semi-strong version of the 
efficient capital markets hypothesis (ECMH). Although this assumption is usually uninteresting for most 
applications of the ECMH, the translation of legal doctrine to investment implications may be nontrivial in some 
situations.124 In fact, the available evidence suggests that Siliconix may not constitute publicly available 
information. For example, the finding that two-thirds of transactions still proceed through the traditional merger 
route is consistent with the view that even corporate law practitioners (who stand to benefit far more than potential 
investors from understanding Siliconix) are not fully aware of the benefits of the Siliconix mechanism and its 
implications for the price that the controller will pay. Recent corporate law textbooks do not include references to 
Siliconix, much less its implications for the choice of transactional form.125 Taken together, this evidence 
suggests that minority shareholders may not be aware of Siliconix or its implications for price, which is an obvious 
prerequisite for the claim that minority investors will adjust price to account for the new tender-offer-freezeout 
mechanism. 
But this argument, too, does not refute Pritchard's basic contention, because the mispricing (if any) is based 
solely on a learning effect rather than a potentially more robust behavioral phenomenon. To the extent that 
Siliconix should influence the pricing of a minority stake, potential minority shareholders who fail to incorporate 
this information into their investment decisions will systematically underperform compared to those who do. Over 
time, Siliconix will be fully priced as investors either learn or are driven from the marketplace. 
Thus Pritchard's provocative question remains: Why should we worry about Siliconix? Certain shareholders 
experienced a one-time negative wealth effect from a shift in legal rules, but this happens all the time in corporate 
law.126 Ex ante pricing of a minority stake will adjust, either immediately or over time, thereby resolving equity 
concerns for prospective minority shareholders and preserving efficiency in the marketplace. 
Within the terms of the current debate, Pritchard's response to proponents of doctrinal convergence hits home. In 
Part II, however, I identify an efficiency loss inherent in existing doctrine that provides an answer to Pritchard's 
important question. 
3. Proposing Doctrinal Convergence Through Hybrid Approaches 
Two sets of commentators have taken middle-ground approaches. Ronald Gilson and Jeff Gordon proposed 
business judgment review if the controller has complied with the procedural protections identified in Pure 
Resources and the SC has veto power over the transaction (i.e., a reconsideration of Lynch], but would impose 
entire fairness review if the controller goes directly to shareholders through a tender offer without gaining SC 
approval (i.e., a reconsideration of Siliconix).117 Prominent Delaware practitioner Frank Balotti, with two 
colleagues, also proposed a hybrid approach, urging a "limited fairness hearing" for freezeout tender offers, or an 
amendment to the Delaware appraisal statute requiring the controller to pay all minority shareholders the 
appraised valued of their shares.128 
These approaches are well considered in that they seek to balance the competing concerns of protecting minority 
shareholders and facilitating valuecreating transactions. As I describe in Part III, my own proposal for reform 
comes closest to these middle-ground approaches, but for different reasons. However, these proposals do not 
explain why the effects of Siliconix and Glassman will not simply be priced ex ante. As described in the previous 
Subsection, defenders of the status quo point out that there are no apparent barriers to a private solution in the 
freezeout arena. Specifically, potential investors will simply pay less, going forward, for a minority position in a 
controlled company, on the expectation that they will receive less if they are forced to exit.129 Without addressing 
this basic point, proponents of doctrinal reform cannot motivate the case for change. In the next Part, I attempt to 
do so. 
II. THE PROBLEM WITH EXISTING DOCTRINE 
In Part I, I reviewed the divergent doctrinal strands on freezeouts and summarized the already substantial body of 
literature that has developed in response. I concluded that while the doctrinal differences are indeed dramatic, 
and have had an impact on deal outcomes, the case for change has remained unclear. In this Part, I identify the 
real problem with existing doctrine. Tender-offer-freezeout doctrine facilitates some inefficient (value-destroying) 
transactions by allowing the controller to exploit asymmetric information against the minority. Merger-freezeout 
doctrine makes the opposite mistake deterring some efficient (value-creating) transactions - because the SC has 
excessive power to block the deal. Taken together, this analysis identifies an efficiency loss that motivates my 
proposal for reform, which I describe in Part III.

A. Opportunistic Behavior in Tender Offer Freezeouts 
1. The Determination of Price in Tender Offer Freezeouts 
In a merger freezeout, the SC bargaining process and the prospect or actuality of entire fairness review determine 
the price paid to the minority shareholders. The determination of price in a tender offer freezeout differs in two 
important respects. First, the SC does not have meaningful bargaining power in freezeout negotiations: It cannot 
veto the transaction, and its only formal authority is to issue a 14D-9 recommendation within ten days of the offer. 
This absence of bargaining power manifests itself in deal outcomes: Controllers pay less in tender offers than in 
mergers.130 
A second difference is that minority shareholders' exclusive remedy in a tender offer freezeout is appraisal, not an 
entire fairness proceeding, which is less potent for two reasons. First, unlike plaintiff shareholders in a class 
action claim for entire fairness, plaintiffs in an appraisal proceeding must bear their own costs, including legal fees 
and the costs of expert witnesses.131 Second, unlike plaintiffs in an entire fairness action, minority shareholders 
in appraisal proceedings must choose between accepting the consideration offered and demanding a judicially 
determined appraisal of their shares.132 Because of these factors it is well accepted among academic 
commentators and practitioners that appraisal is a weak remedy compared to entire fairness review.133 
Without a meaningful SC bargaining process or the background threat of entire fairness review, the sole 
remaining constraint on the price that the controller pays in a tender offer freezeout is the prevailing market price. 
Practitioner interviews and anecdotal evidence confirm this conclusion. For example, according to Charles 
Nathan of Latham & Watkins: "What you're doing in Siliconix is negotiating with the market, you're not negotiating 
with the special committee, in the sense that as long as your price will clear enough of the market to get to ninety 
percent, you win."134 In fact, in Siliconix itself, the chancery court found that the controlling shareholder had 
determined its offer price simply "by applying a 10% premium to the then market price of Siliconix stock."135 
2. Categories of Opportunistic Behavior 
The ability to freeze out the minority at some increment over the market price in a tender offer freezeout, as 
opposed to "fair value" in a merger freezeout, introduces the possibility of opportunistic behavior by the controller. 
I now describe the two basic ways in which opportunistic behavior can manifest itself. 
a. Freezeout Timing 
First, the controller determines the timing of a freezeout. This means that a controller can freeze out the minority 
when it perceives that the market price of the target stock is lower than its intrinsic value.136 Although insider 
trading restrictions prevent the most egregious forms of this kind of opportunism, the controller may be able to 
take advantage of smaller pieces of nonpublic information, which individually do not meet the test for materiality, 
but collectively give the controller greater insight than the public minority shareholders about the intrinsic value of 
the company.137 
This kind of opportunism is not possible in a merger freezeout because the court will engage in, and the SC will 
bargain in the shadow of, a de novo examination of fair value. This background legal entitlement works to detach 
the offer price from the market price, because in entire fairness proceedings courts give little evidentiary weight to 
prevailing market prices.138 Because the controller will have little or no informational advantage over the SC, it is 
unable to exploit differences between market price and intrinsic value in merger-freezeout negotiations. 
b. Influencing the Target's Value 
A second way in which a controller might engage in an opportunistic tender offer freezeout is by influencing the 
value of the target, thereby altering the target's market price and, in turn, the baseline for the 
tender-offer-freezeout price.139 John Coates summarizes the three categories of this kind of behavior: 
underinvestment in positive net present value (NPV) projects; investment in negative NPV projects; and shirking 
managerial responsibilities.140 Each of these three categories can be further divided into reversible value 
reductions and nonreversible value reductions. 
Value reductions that are fully reversible are difficult to come by in the real world, but are theoretically possible. 
Consider the case of a one-time positive NPV project, for which the only question is whether to implement the 
project before or after the freezeout. If the project is not completely transparent to the marketplace, a controller 
might rationally delay this investment until after the freezeout, in order to reap the full benefit rather than sharing 
the benefit with the minority. This value diversion would be difficult to detect, and, even if detected, would likely be

Page 15 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
protected by the business judgment rule, particularly if there were some plausible basis for the delay (e.g., 
reduced risk due to the delay). 
As demonstrated by the example in the previous Subsection,141 this opportunistic behavior would not be 
possible in a merger freezeout because the opportunity presented by the positive NPV project would likely be 
known to the SC and to the court. It is the information asymmetry between the controller and the minority 
shareholders, as compared to the relative symmetry between the controller and the SC, that facilitates the 
controller's opportunistic behavior in a tender offer freezeout. 
In contrast to the one-time positive NPV project, most value reductions are at least partially nonreversible. Take 
the example of managerial shirking, which reduces firm value in ways that cannot be fully recovered after the 
freezeout if certain corporate opportunities are time-limited. When the value reduction cannot be reversed fully, 
the controller's incentives are less clear, because the reduction will hurt the controller in proportion to its pre-deal 
stake in the target. But even with respect to these types of value reductions, it is easy to identify situations in 
which it is still in the controller's interest to deliberately reduce firm value pre-freezeout, provided the value 
reduction is at least partially reversible after the freezeout.142 In any particular case the controller would compare 
its share of the nonreversible value reduction (which is proportional to the controller's pre-freezeout stake) against 
the benefit that arises from a lower tender offer price. 
3. Efficiency Implications 
Following the ex ante pricing argument described in Part I,143 one could argue that the controller's opportunistic 
behavior will also be priced in the minority's initial stake. That is, minority investors will understand not only the 
lower price that they will receive in a freezeout under the tender offer mechanism, but also the controller's 
enhanced ability to exploit asymmetric information to its benefit. Over time, both of these effects will be fully 
priced ex ante, eliminating any unfairness to the minority and maintaining allocational efficiency. 
Despite the superficial appeal of this argument, the possibility for opportunistic behavior does, in fact, yield three 
types of efficiency losses: through nonreversible value reductions, the facilitation of some value-reducing 
freezeouts, and reduced access to minority capital. I now discuss each of these effects in turn. 
a. Nonreversible Value Reductions 
The first, most obvious, social welfare loss arises from nonreversible value reductions. As described above, the 
controller may have incentives to engage in nonreversible value reductions in order to pay a lower price in the 
tender offer freezeout, because the loss from the nonreversible value reduction may be offset by the gain to the 
controller in the form of a lower tender offer price. These nonreversible value reductions, by definition, constitute 
an efficiency loss because they reduce the intrinsic value of the target company. 
b. Facilitating Some Inefficient Freezeouts 
A second social welfare loss arises from the possibility of buying the minority shares at less than their intrinsic 
value. In many cases, the gap between intrinsic value and market value might be bridged by the premium over 
market that the controller must pay in order to succeed in a tender offer freezeout. The empirical evidence in my 
companion paper indicates that, on average, premiums in post-Siliconix tender offer freezeouts are approximately 
25% higher than the preannouncement market price of the target stock.144 While this kind of gap between 
intrinsic value and market value would be rare (though not implausible) in well-functioning capital markets, the 
controller's ability to influence the market price makes a gap of this magnitude more likely in the controlled 
company context. 
To the extent the controller is able to buy the minority shares for less than their intrinsic value, the controller would 
be able to make a profit on a value-destroying (negative synergy) freezeout. To see this point, consider a 
company that has a higher intrinsic value as a public company than as a private company-for example, from the 
ability to attract managers with publicly traded stock options, the benefit of having an acquisition currency, or the 
advantage of analyst coverage. The controller might nevertheless decide to take the company private through a 
tender offer freezeout if it has the opportunity to buy the minority shares for less than their intrinsic value. The 
gains from the tender offer would subsidize the negative consequences of going private, even though overall 
social welfare is higher if the company remains publicly traded. In these cases the tender-offer-freezeout 
mechanism might facilitate some value-destroying (inefficient) transactions. 
c. Reduced Access to Minority Capital

Page 16 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The third, more subtle, social welfare loss that arises from tender offer freezeouts arises from the "lemons effect" 
in corporate freezeouts, first identified and described in detail by Lucian Bebchuk and Marcel Kahan.145 If, as 
described above, the controller will freeze out the minority when the market price is lower than the intrinsic value, 
then minority shareholders should (rationally) receive an important signal when the controller does not freeze 
them out-namely, that the market price fully values or perhaps overvalues the company. Through backward 
induction, the minority shareholders should rationally bid down the value of the stock. In the extreme form of the 
Bebchuk and Kahan model, the market price of the minority shares is bid down to zero because of the negative 
signal that the lack of a freezeout conveys.146 
Zohar Goshen and Zvi Wiener develop a more general model of the Bebchuk and Kahan lemons effect to 
demonstrate that the greater the influence of market prices in determining the freezeout price, the more 
depressed the market price of the minority stock will be.147 At one extreme, if market prices have no influence in 
the determination of the freezeout price, the minority stock is only slightly discounted relative to a pro rata share 
of going concern value. At the other extreme, and consistent with the Bebchuk and Kahan model, if market prices 
are the only determinant of the freezeout price, the minority shares will be worthless. Goshen and Wiener 
conclude that "ironically, the less reliance courts put on market prices, the more accurate are market prices as a 
reflection of fair value."148 
These theoretical models have important implications for the current doctrinal regime. Because the 
merger-freezeout process detaches the freezeout price from the market price, through the combination of the SC 
bargaining process and the shadow of entire fairness review, merger freezeouts do not trigger the lemons effect. 
But because prevailing market prices are the primary determinant of price in a tender offer freezeout, the lemons 
effect will work to depress the value of the minority shares to the extent that the tender offer mechanism is used. 
Of course, several real-world factors might limit the manifestation of the lemons problem. For example, while the 
theoretical models assume that the controlling shareholder can unilaterally freeze out the minority, in the real 
world minority shareholders may say no through their tender decision. If a sufficient percentage of minority 
shareholders refuse to tender, the controller will be unable to get to the 90% threshold that allows a short-form 
merger. Minority shareholders might refuse to tender even if the offer is at a substantial premium if they infer good 
news from the controller's tender offer itself. Similarly, if the controller only makes a tender offer when the inherent 
value of the firm is higher than the market value, then minority shareholders, knowing this fact ex ante, should 
refuse to tender in order to share in the upside that the controller signals by making a tender offer.149 
Other constraints are also possible. A controlling shareholder might not freeze out the minority even if the 
inherent value is greater than the market value if the controller has capital constraints. (Indeed, capital constraints 
may have caused the controller to issue the minority stake in the first place.) The absence of a freezeout by a 
capital-constrained controller should convey no signal to the minority, thereby preventing the adverse inference 
which would trigger the lemons effect. Another possibility is that lawyers will not recommend tender offer 
freezeouts to their clients, either due to doctrinal uncertainty150 or unfamiliarity with the benefits of the 
tender-offer-freezeout mechanism.151 
These checks are likely to prevent the extreme manifestation of the lemons effect, in which minority shares are 
worthless. But to the extent that the lemons effect depresses the price of minority shares, pre-IPO owners would 
have to sell a greater fraction of the company in order to raise the same dollar value of public capital. The 
increase in dilution may deter some entrepreneurs from selling a public stake, even when it would be socially 
desirable for the entrepreneur to do so.152 The clearest example would be a situation in which, absent a lemons 
effect, the controller would only have to sell a minority stake, and therefore would retain control; but with a lemons 
effect the controller would have to sell more than 50% to the public in order to raise the same amount of capital. 
In this scenario the entrepreneur might be deterred from going to the public capital markets at all and instead 
might prefer a strategy that could be financed through internally generated capital. 
One could argue that the entrepreneur in this situation has another alternative-a dual-class IPO-which would 
allow the pre-IPO owners to retain control while raising public capital. However, dual-class structures generate 
considerable skepticism in the marketplace,153 which in itself depresses the trading price for the nonvoting or 
low-voting class of stock.154 In order to avoid this treatment, pre-IPO owners may wish to maintain the 
connection between cash-flow ownership and voting rights through a single class of stock. But the possibility of a 
tender offer freezeout will depress the price that they will receive in this offering. The result will be a distortion, at 
the margin, of the entrepreneur's decision on whether to sell a public stake. 
B. Deterring Efficient Freezeouts Through the Merger Mechanism 
In the previous Section, I demonstrated how existing doctrine encourages some inefficient tender offer 
freezeouts. I now discuss ways in which existing doctrine also discourages some efficient merger freezeouts.

Page 17 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Specifically, I demonstrate that the procedural protections for minority shareholders identified in Part I-the 
negotiation between the controlling shareholder and the SC and the possibility (or actuality) of entire fairness 
review-can deter some value-increasing merger-freezeout transactions. 
1. The Problem of Special Committee Resistance 
a. With Special Committee Veto Power 
As described in Part I, the post-Lynch world of freezeout merger negotiations seems to require SC veto power 
over the transaction.155 To the extent that there is ambiguity about this point (discussed in the next 
Subsection156), many controllers explicitly bestow veto power on the SC in a merger freezeout.157 My empirical 
evidence indicates that SCs have made frequent use of this veto power. In my database of all post-Siliconix 
freezeouts, I find that the controller withdrew in eighteen out of the eighty freezeout merger negotiations with an 
SC that were announced between June 2001 and April 2005, a 23% failure rate, even though the controller's first 
offer invariably represented a premium over the prevailing market price.158 
An obvious concern in this area is that SCs might reject some freezeout offers out of self-interest rather than the 
interest of minority shareholders. The independent directors who are appointed to the SC typically leave the 
target board when the target becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of the controlling shareholder. Therefore, 
precisely the same agency issues that have pervaded the debate about target-board resistance in hostile 
takeovers apply to SC resistance against a controlling shareholder. Yet the Delaware courts have approached 
these two questions in dramatically different ways. In the hostile takeover context, defensive tactics taken by 
target boards are subject to enhanced intermediate scrutiny as articulated in Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum,159 
because of the "omnipresent specter" that directors are acting in their self-interest rather than in the interest of the 
corporation.160 But in the merger-freezeout context, the Delaware courts have not only permitted unfettered SC 
veto power, they seem to have required it. This dramatically different approach in the merger-freezeout arena 
may deter some efficient freezeouts. 
Agency problems may play out in a more subtle way as well, due to the litigious nature of the merger-freezeout 
process. According to a senior corporate lawyer with significant experience advising SCs in freezeouts: 
Imagine yourself in that role [of an SC member]. You are, to be sure, paid a special fee for this combat duty-but 
peanuts in the greater scheme of things . . . say $50K. You receive that fee irrespective of whether you do or don't 
endorse the controller's proposal. There's a near certainty that you'll be sued if you endorse that proposal. And, 
your asserted independence notwithstanding, some subset of the world suspects, or at least the plaintiffs' bar will 
assert, that the game is rigged. The easiest and safest course is plainly to duck or run. No wonder you insist on 
the controller's offering $X more per share before you present your chin in the middle of the ring.161 
As suggested by this anecdotal evidence, unchecked veto power, combined with potentially misaligned incentives 
between the SC members and the minority shareholders, creates at least the potential for some efficient 
freezeouts to be blocked.162 
b. Without Special Committee Veto Power 
As practitioners become more comfortable with the tender-offer-freezeout mechanism, merger freezeouts may 
increasingly be negotiated in the shadow of a tender-offer-freezeout threat. In a curious twist of Delaware 
corporate law, the controller would be subject to entire fairness review, with no burden shift, if the controller 
threatens a tender offer, and the SC agrees to a merger deal on the basis of the threat.103 But if the controller 
simply breaks off negotiations, a subsequent (even immediate) tender offer to the minority would seem to avoid 
entire fairness review.104 In view of these twists, a well-advised controller will engage in a kabuki dance of 
making a final offer, and perhaps hinting at its walk-away alternative, but not threatening the SC in a manner that 
would eliminate the SC's ability to say no under Lynch. 
Interestingly, no freezeout of a Delaware target since Siliconix has exhibited the pattern of merger freezeout 
negotiations, impasse, and a tender offer to the minority, possibly due to a broad reading of Lynch that requires 
SC veto power. But a recent freezeout involving a Minnesota target, where Lynch is not binding authority, 
illustrates how this shadow might play out going forward. In December 2003, Kontron AG (Kontron) offered to buy 
the remaining 35% of Kontron Mobile (Mobile) that it did not already own for $0.45 cash per share.l6s Kontron 
proposed to structure the deal as a two-step tender offer, subject to approval by an SC of independent directors 
and a MOM condition.166 The Mobile SC hired legal and financial advisors and began negotiating with Kontron. 
In March 2004, Kontron expressed "disappointment" about the lack of progress in these negotiations, and, in an 
effort to push things forward, took the unusual step of offering to either match or sell to any bona fide third-party

Page 18 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
bidder that the Mobile SC might come up with.167 The SC responded that it would take "a significant amount of 
time" to undertake the market check that Kontron had suggested.168 Kontron responded that it would make a 
tender offer directly to the minority shareholders at $0.55 per share, with a 90% closing condition.109 The Mobile 
SC issued a 140-9, remaining neutral on the offer.170 Kontron successfully acquired 91% of the voting shares in 
its tender offer, thereby satisfying the 90% condition,171 and completed its short-form back-end merger in August 
2004.172 
As the Kontron fact pattern begins to appear more often, the efficiency loss that arises from tender-offer-freezeout 
doctrine will spill over into the mergerfreezeout arena. The reason is that the controller's walk-away alternative is 
no longer to do nothing, but rather, if carefully orchestrated, to make a tender offer to the minority. The SC may 
therefore agree to a price, even if it does not believe that this price represents fair value (perhaps due to 
nonpublic information), if it believes that the controller would be successful in a tender offer to the minority at that 
price. 
In a regime in which the tender offer option is well understood, therefore, prices in merger freezeouts will be 
driven down to the predicted prices in tender offer freezeouts.173 Plaintiffs' counsel will be even less effective 
than the SC in extracting more than the tender offer price because the tender offer alternative avoids entire 
fairness review entirely. Therefore, there is no settlement value that translates into a higher price in the 
merger-freezeout negotiations. This conclusion introduces the efficiency loss that is inherent in tender offer 
doctrine, including the controller's incentive to engage in opportunistic behavior against the minority. 
2. The Problem of Deterred Deals 
While the problem of blocked deals involves efficient freezeouts that are initiated by the controller but are not 
consummated, the problem of deterred deals involves efficient freezeouts that are never initiated. I discuss two 
deterrent effects: the fact that SCs in the current regime are likely to extract some part of the synergies in 
freezeout mergers that occur; and the possibility that entire fairness litigation acts as a "tax" on the controller's 
freezeout decision. 
a. Through Allocation of Deal Synergies 
I begin with the assumption that the likelihood that a controller will initiate a freezeout increases monotonically 
with the controller's expected profits from the deal.174 It follows that the controller should receive the full value of 
the synergies from the deal, in order to maximize the likelihood that controllers will initiate value-creating 
freezeouts.175 The question then becomes whether and to what extent the merger-freezeout process provides 
the controller with the full value of the synergies from the deal. 
The overall picture on this question is that courts have been notoriously unpredictable in their approach to 
synergy value in entire fairness proceedings. As a starting point, courts in entire fairness proceedings generally 
look to the appraisal remedy, and here section 262(h) of the Delaware corporate code mandates that "fair value" 
in appraisal shall be determined "exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment . . . of the 
merger."176 Although this language on its face would seem to exclude synergy value, Delaware courts have 
muddied the water considerably. Weinberger began the confusion with its holding that section 262(h) only 
excludes "speculative elements of value that may arise from the 'accomplishment or expectation' of the 
merger."177 While subsequent chancery court opinions have read Weinberger narrowly in order to exclude 
synergy value from the minority's entitlement,178 on the one occasion that the Delaware Supreme Court revisited 
Weinberger's reading of section 262(h) it confirmed its earlier holding.179 
In addition, there is a more subtle way in which courts might arrive at a share of the synergies. In contrast to 
valuation in an appraisal proceeding, courts are not bound by the statutory language of section 262(h) in an entire 
fairness proceeding. In particular, a court may determine that fairness requires rescissory damages, defined as 
what minority shareholders would receive if the freezeout transaction were rescinded.180 If the synergies from 
the deal do not depend on taking the company from public to private status, then a rescissory damages approach 
would provide minority shareholders with a share of the synergies from the deal. 
Using either Weinberger's interpretation of section 262(h) or the flexibility inherent in an equitable remedy, then, 
courts have the authority to award a share of the synergies in an entire fairness proceeding. As a result, SCs 
bargaining in the shadow of entire fairness will be able to extract a share of the synergies as well. Reducing the 
controller's expected profits from the freezeout in this way deters some value-increasing freezeouts, under the 
assumption that the likelihood of freezeout increases monotonically with the controller's profits from the deal. 
b. Through Litigation Costs

Page 19 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
A second factor that might deter some deals is the high likelihood of litigation costs that arises from 
merger-freezeout doctrine. The availability of a class action claim for entire fairness, combined with a presumption 
that the first to file should be named lead or co-lead counsel, creates a "race to the courthouse" in which plaintiffs' 
counsel will typically file multiple lawsuits in the few days (and even hours) after the freezeout merger is 
announced.181 This litigation activity imposes costs on the controlling shareholder because the controller will 
typically agree, in effect, to pay plaintiffs' legal fees as part of its settlement.182 These litigation costs do not 
create an ex post social welfare loss, because they merely represent a wealth transfer from the controller to 
plaintiffs' counsel. Rather, a social welfare loss might arise because a controller may be deterred ex ante from 
initiating an efficient transaction by the expected "tax" imposed by plaintiffs' counsel. 
The empirical evidence indicates that this tax represents a trivial fraction of the overall value of transactions: One 
study of shareholder class actions in Delaware finds a fee range of 0.005% to 1-36% of the deal value, with an 
average fee of 0.19%.183 By way of comparison, the tax imposed by investment bankers, lawyers, and 
accountants in arms-length acquisitions is typically in the range of 1.0% to 2.0% of deal value.184 Therefore, 
while expected litigation costs might deter merger freezeouts in theory, the magnitude of the litigation costs as a 
percentage of deal value suggests that such deterrence, if any, should be small in practice. 
In the recent and important decision In re Cox Communications, Inc. Shareholders Litigation,185 Vice Chancellor 
Strine of the Delaware Chancery Court reduced the fee for plaintiffs' counsel in the Cox Communications 
freezeout from the requested $4.95 million (amounting to 0.06% of deal value) to $1.275 million (0.015% of deal 
value). The case involved the merger freezeout of the Cox Communications minority shareholders described in 
the Introduction to this Article. While the court endorsed the empirical claim that prices in merger freezeouts are 
higher than prices in tender offer freezeouts,186 the court held that the vast majority of the difference was 
attributable to the SC's bargaining power and not to the efforts of plaintiffs' counsel armed with a litigation threat 
over fairness.187 The court also expressed its displeasure at the "premature, hastily-drafted, makeweight 
complaints attacking a fully negotiable proposal by the Cox family."188 
Of course, it is too soon to tell what the consequences of the court's decision in Cox Communications will be. 
Simplistic, first-order predictions are obvious: To the extent that other chancery court judges follow this precedent, 
fee awards and fee requests will be lower, which will lead to an even smaller deterrence effect in the merger 
freezeout arena than currently exists. In addition, plaintiffs' counsel will be more likely to wait until the SC has 
agreed to a price before deciding whether to bring a class action fairness claim, both to make their contribution 
transparent and to avoid the accusation of "premature" litigation. 
Potential second-order effects are more troubling. If plaintiffs' counsel do in fact hold back to let the SC "work its 
magic," as urged by the Cox court, controlling shareholders will be less likely to pay full value to the SC due to the 
uncertainty in its next round of negotiations with plaintiffs' counsel. The prospect of two sequential negotiations, in 
which the first negotiation sets a price floor for the second, is likely to be more onerous to the controller than a 
single simultaneous negotiation with the SC and plaintiffs' counsel. The result would be increased (not decreased) 
deterrence of merger freezeouts and, in the case of undeterred deals, a greater likelihood of impasse with the SC 
because of the controller's lower willingness to pay full value. 
Another problematic effect arises from the fact that plaintiffs' counsel have choices about where to bring 
shareholder class action complaints. If Delaware courts are perceived as being stingy about fees in freezeout 
litigation, plaintiffs' counsel will bring their claims in other states that can exercise jurisdiction over the deal, such 
as the state that is home to the target's headquarters or principal place of business.189 These other states will 
have less well-developed judicial approaches to freezeouts than Delaware, which would introduce further 
uncertainty from the controller's perspective, which, in turn, would deter value-increasing freezeouts. 
Of course, the Delaware courts need not entertain these second-order policy arguments in determining the 
appropriate level of fees in Cox or other freezeout transactions. But to the extent that the courts' objective in 
formulating freezeout doctrine is to facilitate value-increasing transactions, it is important to recognize that the 
reduction of fees may work in the opposite direction. Under the present regime, the empirical evidence indicates 
that litigation costs are unlikely to have a significant deterrent effect on mergerfreezeout activity. In an alternative 
regime in which fairness actions involving Delaware freezeout targets are regularly brought in California or New 
York, for example, the deterrent effect may be larger. 
Rather than mount a frontal attack on fees, the better approach would be to recalibrate standards of judicial 
review, as proposed in Part III of this Article. Indeed, in dicta, the Cox Communications court endorsed elements 
of the proposal put forward here and by Gilson and Gordon in their recommended approach to freezeouts.190 
C. The Absence of a Private Solution

Page 20 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
I now turn to the question of whether and to what extent the efficiency losses identified in this Part are avoidable 
through private contracting between the controller and the minority. The structure of corporate law in the United 
States has evolved from a regime of largely mandatory rules to a regime of largely default rules that may be 
modified through the corporate charter.191 In many areas of corporate law, then, the controller and the minority 
have the ability to contract around the default provisions if these provisions are inefficient, unclear, or both. 
Surprisingly, the efficiency losses identified in this Part seem to be an exception to this general approach. On 
merger-freezeout doctrine, the efficiency loss arises primarily from the SC's power to block the deal, which is 
mandated by the Weinberger-to-Lynch line of cases and cannot be avoided through private contracting. On 
tender-offer-freezeout doctrine, a potential solution would be to amend the corporate charter: for example, the 
charter could mandate the payment of fair value in any freezeout transaction, as determined in a judicial 
proceeding or by an arbitrator, thereby disconnecting the freezeout price from the market price.192 This charter 
term would not apply to the tender offer itself, because a tender offer does not require corporate action and 
therefore is not subject to any restrictions that the charter might impose. But in order to complete a tender offer 
freezeout a controller must use the short-form merger statute. The short-form merger constitutes corporate action, 
which therefore would be subject to a corporate charter provision mandating a particular valuation process or 
formula. 
The problem with this analysis is that the minority's exclusive remedy in a short-form merger is appraisal, not 
entire fairness.193 As discussed in Subsection IIA.1 above, this remedy imposes significant procedural and 
substantive hurdles on minority shareholders that make it an ineffective backstop against opportunistic tender 
offers. As a result, this private solution would be unlikely to solve the efficiency loss identified in this Part. 
Another potential private solution would be through a so-called standstill agreement, in which the controller would 
be unable to increase its stake without the target board's approval.194 In effect, a controller would relinquish its 
right to execute a tender offer freezeout through the standstill. The problem with this approach, however, is that it 
goes too far. By forcing the controller to go through the merger route, the SC would gain veto power over the deal 
which would reintroduce the problem of blocked deals described in Subsection II.B.1.a above. 
III. A PROPOSAL FOR REFORM 
Part II identifies an efficiency loss inherent in existing freezeout doctrine. The most important source of the 
efficiency loss arises from tender-offerfreezeout doctrine, as it has developed through Siliconix and Glassman. A 
secondary, but still important, efficiency loss arises from merger-freezeout doctrine as it has developed through 
Weinberger and Lynch. Because these social welfare losses are unlikely to be resolved through private 
contracting, they are likely to persist until the judiciary intervenes. In this Part, I propose such an intervention. 
In contrast to prior commentators, who have generally taken a patchwork approach to freezeout doctrine, I 
propose a doctrinal recalibration that is grounded in first principles of corporate law. This grounding would reduce 
perceptions of arbitrariness, increase doctrinal coherence, and limit possibilities for future (and currently 
unforeseen) transactional arbitrage that might again create an efficiency loss. 
A. First Principles of Corporate Law 
1. The Arms-Length Approach to Fundamental Transactions 
In arms-length transactions, the general approach for consummating a merger or acquisition requires two stages 
of approval : first, approval by the target board; and second, approval by the target shareholders.195 Tender 
offers might be considered an exception to this general approach because a bidder, at least in theory, can bypass 
the board and make a tender offer directly to target shareholders. However, in practice, the poison pill makes 
board approval a prerequisite even for tender offers.196 And on the second step of shareholder approval, the 
Delaware corporate code requires approval from a majority of the shares outstanding in a merger197 and 
approval from a majority of shares outstanding (in the form of shares tendered) in a tender offer. Therefore, in the 
modern (post-pill) world, we have parity between tender offers and mergers in both stages of the approval 
process.198 
For a deal that has received both board approval and shareholder approval, the standard of judicial review for the 
transaction turns on whether there is a "sale of control." Deals in which shareholders lose their governance rights 
-for example, an acquisition for cash -clearly constitute a sale of control and therefore trigger enhanced scrutiny 
under Revlon.199 When Revlon duties apply, the target board of directors has the burden of showing that it 
maximized immediate value for its shareholders.200 Other deals-for example, part-cash, part-stock deals-may or 
may not trigger Revlon duties.201 The Delaware courts have held that freezeouts do not trigger Revlon duties, for 
the simple reason that minority shareholders in a controlled company do not have control to begin with.202

Page 21 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
If a deal receives both board approval and shareholder approval and is not subject to Revlon duties, the business 
judgment rule will protect the transaction from judicial review. The recent case of Klein v. Roslyn Bancorp203 
illustrates the degree to which courts will defer to the board and approving shareholders in this scenario. Roslyn 
involved the arms-length merger between Roslyn Bancorp and New York Community Bancorp in June 2003. The 
boards of Rosyln and New York Community had both approved the stock-for-stock merger, in which each share 
of Roslyn would be exchanged for 0.75 newly issued shares of New York Community.204 Roslyn shareholders 
subsequently approved the deal, even though it represented only a 3.2% premium when it was announced and a 
negative premium by the time the deal closed.205 Plaintiffs were former Roslyn shareholders, who claimed that 
the Roslyn directors had breached their fiduciary duty in approving the merger with New York Community at too 
low of a price. A New York state court, applying Delaware law, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim 
"in light of the long standing principles of the Business Judgment Rule."206 Despite the unusually low price, the 
court refused to second-guess a deal that had been approved by a disinterested target board and a majority of its 
shareholders. 
The conceptual underpinnings for this two-stage approach can be found in the different roles that board approval 
and shareholder approval play. A target board (or, in practice, one or a few of its members) can negotiate with the 
acquirer. If the parties negotiate effectively, they will explore various options, assess tradeoffs across issues, and 
make offers and counteroffers, thus identifying a fair range for the deal.207 In this multiround, repeated 
interaction, the target and acquirer allocate the surplus. Target shareholders then make a single "binary choice" 
on a take-it-or-leave-it offer presented to them by their board. While this choice serves as a useful check on a 
disloyal or complacent board, it is not of the same quality as a negotiation with the acquirer. In particular, the 
threat of a withheld tender by minority shareholders might be effective against grossly inadequate offers but may 
not be effective in providing more than the low end of the bargaining range -much less a "fair" price.208 
Although the basic approval process in the arms-length arena requires two stages, there is a way around the first 
step of board approval. For the past thirty years, the Delaware courts have assiduously protected the right of 
target shareholders to elect directors,209 who must then be able to act with a free hand in the management and 
oversight of the company.210 The ability to run a proxy contest to replace the target board gives an acquirer a 
way to go around an incumbent board's determination of inadequacy. By extension it means that the target board 
does not have an unfettered right to resist a takeover; rather, in the arms-length arena, this veto right is 
constrained by the ability of target shareholders to elect a new board. 
Admittedly, this end-run around the target board may not always be viable. A proxy contest can cost millions of 
dollars, which is not reimbursed unless the insurgent is successful.211 In addition, when the target board is 
staggered, a potential acquirer needs to run not one but two proxy contests, spaced as long as thirteen months 
apart, in order to replace a majority of the target-board directors. Bebchuk, Coates, and I have presented 
empirical evidence indicating that this is an extremely difficult route.212 But this finding does not change the basic 
point that no board, including a board that is staggered, has an absolute veto right against a controller. Rather, if 
the acquirer can gain sufficient support from target shareholders and is sufficiently patient, it can override a 
target-board veto to proceed to the second step (shareholder approval) in an arms-length deal.213 
Thus, the picture we have from the arms-length arena can be characterized as follows: substantial, but not 
unfettered, discretion for a target board to negotiate with an acquirer, followed by a shareholder vote as a final 
check on the deal. Of course, neither of these procedural protections is directly available in the freezeout arena, 
because the acquirer controls both the target board and the target shareholder vote. But the Delaware courts 
have urged procedural protections in the freezeout context that invoke features of the arms-length process. 
Weinberger's insistence on an SC of independent directors,214 Lynch's focus on the SC's "power to say no,"215 
and Pure Resources's promotion of a MOM condition216 can all be seen as manifestations of this approach. 
2. Application to Freezeout Doctrine 
While Delaware courts have drawn comparisons between procedural protections in freezeouts and the two steps 
of the arms-length approach, they have never made the features of the arms-length approach the basis for 
assessing the procedural protections in freezeouts.217 As a result, current freezeout doctrine falls short of the 
arms-length standard for both tender offer freezeouts and merger freezeouts. Specifically, tender-offer-freezeout 
doctrine is deficient with respect to the first step of the arms-length standard (board approval), while 
merger-freezeout doctrine is deficient with respect to the second step of the arms-length standard (shareholder 
approval). I describe these two points in more detail in the remainder of this Subsection. 
a. Tender Offer Freezeouts 
The deficiency in tender-offer-freezeout doctrine is easy to understand: As demonstrated by empirical evidence 
as well as practitioner commentary, SCs lack adequate bargaining power against a controlling shareholder. This

Page 22 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
fact minimizes the first-stage negotiation that is so critical in the arms-length arena for ensuring an adequate 
price. In fact, some practitioner commentary suggests that too much back-and-forth with the SC in a tender offer 
freezeout may cause a future Delaware court to find "board action" that would eliminate the safe harbor provided 
by Siliconix and trigger entire fairness review.218 The result is that SCs in tender offer freezeouts typically play a 
minimal role, consisting of making 140-9 recommendations to minority shareholders on offers that have been 
predetermined, or at least largely determined, by the controller. 
b. Merger Freezeouts 
In contrast to tender-offer-freezeout doctrine, merger-freezeout doctrine falls short on the second step of the 
arms-length process, approval from disinterested shareholders. Only one-third of post-Siliconix merger freezeouts 
included a MOM condition.219 In the remaining two-thirds of merger freezeouts, minority shareholders received 
no opportunity to express a view on the transaction because the controller can (and does) simply vote its stake in 
favor of the deal. The reason stems from Rosenblatt: Because a controller receives no incremental benefit in 
terms of judicial scrutiny from including a MOM condition after the SC has approved the deal (either or both of 
these protections merely shift the burden on entire fairness review), most controllers do not provide a MOM 
condition to the minority.220 Contrast this outcome to the arms-length process, which always requires 
shareholder approval in the form of a merger vote or tendered shares. 
MOM conditions serve two critical purposes in freezeouts. First, they provide a final check through a binary choice 
on a board recommendation, as described in the arms-length context above. Second, and unique to the freezeout 
context, a MOM condition implicitly subjects the controller's offer to a "market check."221 For example, take a 
60% controlling shareholder who negotiates a freezeout merger with an SC of independent directors, at $10 cash 
per share. Without a MOM condition, the deal is finalized at this point: The target board will recommend the deal 
to its shareholders, and the controller will vote its 60% stake in favor of the deal. In contrast, with a MOM 
condition, there is the possibility of a "deal jumper" who can offer more. Consider a thirdparty T who is willing to 
pay $12 cash for all shares. After the announcement of the merger, and before the shareholder vote required by 
the MOM condition, T can announce a tender offer for the minority shares at $12 per share. Minority shareholders 
now face a choice between voting in favor of a merger in which they will receive $10 per share, or tendering to T 
at $12. The outcome is not difficult to predict. If the controller nevertheless persists, T can block the deal by voting 
its newly acquired majority-of-the-minority stake against it. The controller will then be forced to either buy out T, 
presumably at more than $12 per share, or sell its stake to T as well. 
In short, a MOM condition can facilitate an implicit market check in a merger freezeout, and, in fact, is the only 
way to subject a merger freezeout to a market check. This is because a controlling shareholder cannot be 
compelled to sell its shares to a higher-value bidder (or anyone else),222 and the Delaware courts have held that 
a merger freezeout does not trigger Revlon duties, which would require the SC to facilitate and possibly even 
seek out competing bids.223 Instead, the vast majority of controlling shareholders indicate in their initial approach 
to the target that they are not interested in selling to a competing bidder.224 As a result, the SC typically cannot 
develop options away from the table, which are often considered to be an important source of bargaining power in 
negotiations generally.225 
3. Synthesis 
The comparison between the arms-length process and the freezeout process illuminates the ways in which 
freezeout doctrine should be reformed. The target of my proposal is the judiciary, because the Delaware 
legislature is unlikely to act in this arena anytime soon. The principal lever is the application of entire fairness 
review rather than business judgment review. Fairness review is a judicial (not statutory) construct, and therefore 
can be shaped with a relatively free hand by the Delaware courts. The central claim in the remainder of this 
Article is that courts should assess the extent to which the freezeout negotiation process emulates both prongs of 
the arms-length deal process namely, disinterested board approval and disinterested shareholder approval. When 
a freezeout process provides both of these procedural safeguards, a court should apply business judgment 
review, regardless of the transactional form that is used. Conversely, when the process does not include these 
procedural safeguards, a court should apply entire fairness review. 
The objective, then, is to construct a more tailored application of standards of judicial review that is sensitive to 
specific procedural choices that the controller and the SC make. If properly constructed, the system of standards 
of review would create incentives for controllers to provide adequate procedural protections to the minority, 
regardless of the transactional form used. These procedural protections would eliminate the efficiency loss 
identified in Part II. In the remainder of this Article, I describe the details that follow from this overall approach. 
B. Reforming Tender-Offer-Freezeout Doctrine

1. Increasing Special Committee Bargaining Power 
On tender-offer-freezeout doctrine, the objective is to increase SC bargaining power so as to emulate the board 
approval step in an arms-length transaction. Providing SCs with meaningful bargaining power would reinsert a 
well-informed committee on the other side of the negotiation process in tender offer freezeouts. This would 
reduce the information asymmetry between the parties at the table, which, in turn, would reduce the controller's 
ability to engage in the socially inefficient opportunistic behavior described in the previous Part. 
There are two ways in which SC bargaining power might be increased: by constructing standards of judicial 
review that encourage SC approval, or by mandating the SC's use of a poison pill against the controller. In this 
Part, I examine these two approaches and conclude that adjusting standards of judicial review is preferable to the 
private solution of a pill. 
a. Through Standards of Judicial Review 
Increasing SC bargaining power through standards of judicial review would require a reconsideration, in part, of 
Siliconix. The critical departure from existing doctrine is that a tender offer freezeout that does not receive 
affirmative SC approval should be subject to entire fairness review rather than simply business judgment 
review.226 As a result, and in contrast to the current regime, the SC in a tender offer freezeout would have 
something to give (or withhold) - namely, judicial deference to the offer price. The new bargaining process, 
conducted in the shadow of a judicial determination of entire fairness, would detach the price paid to the minority 
from the prevailing market price, by allowing other, nonpublic, factors to enter into the negotiation. This would 
reduce incentives for the controller to respond to, or create, discrepancies between intrinsic value and market 
price. 
Although the proposed approach might seem to increase litigation costs because of the new potential for entire 
fairness review in tender offer freezeouts, the actual cost increase may be zero in a dynamic framework because 
controllers could avoid entire fairness review by reaching an agreement with the SC. This point highlights another 
benefit of the proposed approach over other, more simplistic, approaches. Under current doctrine, no party 
engages in a fair price determination in a tender offer freezeout. In simplistic proposals for reform, courts should 
engage in a determination of entire fairness, with all of the attendant difficulties of judicial valuation proceedings. 
In contrast, the approach outlined here allows the SC and the controller to make a fairness determination 
together. While both of these parties will of course be biased, the biases are in opposite directions and should 
cancel out, at least in part, through the give and take of a meaningful negotiation. Therefore, not only would this 
approach avoid the administrative costs of a fairness determination by the court, it would also lead to a more 
accurate fairness determination than a court could provide. 
b. Through Ability To Deploy a Pill 
Instead of adjusting standards of judicial review, courts could enhance SC bargaining power by requiring SCs to 
adopt poison pills against controlling shareholders in tender-offer-freezeout negotiations.227 The Delaware 
Chancery Court has recently confirmed that SCs may adopt a pill against a controller;228 some commentators go 
further to suggest that the SC should seek, and the target board should be required to give, the ability to block the 
bid at least temporarily through a pill.229 This expansion was considered and rejected in Pure Resources itself, 
though Vice Chancellor Strine noted in his opinion the "analytical and normative appeal" of such an approach.230 
As of May 2005, an SC has adopted a pill against a controller only once, in ICN Pharmaceutical's June 2003 
freezeout tender offer for the remaining 19.9% interest in Ribapharm. This move yielded a 12% increase over 
ICN's initial offer, consistent with the goal of increasing SC bargaining power in tender offer freezeouts. 
The problem with this alternative is that a pill might either go too far, or not far enough, in providing SC bargaining 
power. First, too far: A pill might give an SC absolute veto power that might then deter some efficient freezeouts, 
for the reasons described in the analysis of merger-freezeout doctrine.231 On its face, a pill would seem to give 
this veto power because a pill is generally regarded as a "show stopper" against potential acquirers, including, if 
structured correctly, a controlling shareholder.232 If the controller has veto power over the transaction (through its 
ability to rescind its offer) and the SC has veto power (through a pill), the predicted outcome will be determined by 
their relative bargaining power rather than in the shadow of entire fairness review. An SC may use its bargaining 
power to attempt to extract all of the synergies (or more), which would then deter potentially efficient freezeouts. 
Alternatively, the pill might not go far enough. Because the controller typically controls the target's board, it might 
rescind the pill over the objection of an obstinate SC and then proceed unilaterally with its tender offer to the 
minority. There has not been sufficient experience with pills in the context of controlled companies to know 
whether a controller could or would do this.233 But the unclear legal rules that would govern this sort of

Page 24 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
maneuvering suggest that a pill deployed by an SC might be mere window dressing, to be pulled by the controller 
at the moment the SC puts up a fight. 
To summarize, there is no conceptual reason to believe that the ability to deploy a pill would achieve the socially 
optimal outcome. Even the direction of the error is ambiguous, given the absence of case law on the use of pills in 
the freezeout context. This is not to say that a pill might not be useful for an SC to demand-and a target board to 
give-in some contexts. But the analysis in this Section suggests that the better approach in bolstering SC 
bargaining power in freezeout tender offers is through adjustments to standards of judicial review. The ability to 
deploy a pill should continue to be a matter of negotiation between the SC and the target board, and not a matter 
of fiduciary duty imposed by the courts.234 
2. Promoting Majority-of-the-Minority Conditions 
SC approval should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for business judgment review of tender offer 
freezeouts. Following Pure Resources, an offer should be deemed noncoercive only if it includes a MOM 
condition as well.235 When the freezeout includes meaningful SC approval and a MOM condition, it resembles an 
arms-length deal and therefore should receive minimal scrutiny from the courts. Any deviation from this blueprint 
-SC approval without a MOM condition, or a MOM condition without SC approval - does not look like an 
arms-length process and, therefore, should trigger entire fairness review. This insistence on a two-stage approval 
process emphasizes the point that SC approval and a MOM condition are not substitutes for each other; rather, 
as explained above, the SC's function is to bargain vigorously with the controller, while a MOM condition can 
provide only a final check through the binary choice of minority shareholder approval.236 
While Pure Resources indicates that a tender offer freezeout will be subject to entire fairness review, not business 
judgment review, unless it includes a nonwaivable MOM condition, the decision does not make clear who would 
have the burden in the scenario in which the SC rejects the deal but the controller nevertheless gets MOM 
approval. If the burden remained with the defendant in this scenario, then a controller would have no incentive to 
provide a MOM condition if the SC withheld its approval. In order to create such an incentive, I propose extending 
the rule articulated in the merger-freezeout context237 to tender offers: A MOM condition, even without SC 
approval, will shift the burden to the plaintiff. This means that a controller who goes around the SC would have an 
incentive to nevertheless include a MOM condition in order to achieve burden-shifting on entire fairness. 
3. The Influence of Sarbanes-Oxley and Stock Exchange Listing Requirements 
One concern with these proposed reforms is that they might trigger fairness review where current doctrine does 
not, in instances when a controller has complied with the full set of procedural protections that are available to it. 
This would happen when a target board has no independent directors, and, therefore, cannot form an SC to 
negotiate with the controller. In my sample of post-Siliconix freezeouts, I find four such transactions out of 
thirty-five tender offer freezeouts.238 Under existing doctrine, these transactions were subject only to business 
judgment review by the court.239 In contrast, under the reforms proposed in this Part, these transactions would 
have been subject to entire fairness review due to the absence of SC approval. 
Fortunately, this problem will not exist under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the new stock exchange listing 
requirements. While companies with a controlling shareholder are exempt from the requirement that a majority of 
the directors be independent,240 all publicly traded companies, including controlled companies, must have a 
completely independent audit committee.241 Therefore, under current corporate governance rules, all target 
companies will have the ability to form an SC, which means that corporate law should draw a negative inference 
in situations where an SC is not formed. This inference is built into the reforms proposed above, in that a 
controller cannot get business judgment review for the transaction if an SC is not formed. The converse of this 
point is equally important: The proposed reforms give a controller substantial incentives to form an SC, because 
this is the only way to avoid entire fairness review by the courts. 
C. Reforming Merger-Freezeout Doctrine 
1. Promoting Majority-of-the-Minority Conditions 
My principal proposal for merger-freezeout doctrine seeks to promote MOM conditions in addition to an SC 
process in order to emulate both prongs of arms-length negotiations, namely, disinterested board approval and 
disinterested shareholder approval. Under current doctrine, either an SC process or a MOM condition shifts the 
burden on entire fairness review from defendant to plaintiff. My proposed addition is that the combination of an 
SC process and a MOM condition should shift the standard of judicial review from entire fairness to business 
judgment review. 242 A merger-freezeout process that looks like an arms-length process - meaningful bargaining

Page 25 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
by the SC followed by an informed vote of the minority shareholders -is not inherently suspect and, therefore, 
should receive deference from the courts. 
This refinement would have two effects. First, and most obviously, it would increase the number of MOM 
conditions by creating doctrinal incentives for the controller to provide a MOM condition to the minority. As noted 
above, a MOM condition would provide an implicit market check on the controller's offer to the minority. second, 
and equally important, it would minimize the application of fairness review, which would reduce administrative 
costs. 
This proposed refinement would not require a reconsideration of the burden-shifting approach outlined in Lynch. 
An SC process or a MOM condition would continue to shift the burden on entire fairness. The additional layer 
proposed here is that the combination of an SC process and a MOM condition would give the controller business 
judgment review by the court. 
2. Bolstering the Tender Offer Threat 
A second, more subtle, refinement to existing doctrine involves the court's specific holding in Lynch, that 
threatening the SC with a tender offer to the minority eliminates the SC's "ability to say no."243 Following the 
approach described in Subsection III.A.1, the SC's veto power in a freezeout merger negotiation should emulate a 
target board's veto power in an arms-length merger, which is subject to a "proxy contest out." This means that a 
controller should be able to resort to its otherwise legitimate walk-away alternative of a tender offer directly to 
minority shareholders. By extension, a controller should be able to threaten this route as a negotiating tactic at the 
table with the SC - a reversal of the court's holding in Lynch. 
Even under this proposed approach, certain threats may continue to be impermissible. Consider, for example, a 
threat to proceed unilaterally with the transaction -i.e., ignoring the SC, voting the deal through at the board level 
over the independent directors' objections, and then voting the deal through at the shareholder level without a 
MOM condition.244 This kind of threat should continue to be impermissible under Lynch (meaning that the 
controller should have the burden to demonstrate fairness) because it strips the SC of its veto power, leaving no 
further check on the controller's actions. 
The guiding principle for treating unilateral threats differently continues to be the arms-length standard. In the 
arms-length context, a threat to go around the target board still requires the approval of a majority of target 
shareholders in the proxy contest-that is, there is no way for the buyer to unilaterally acquire the target. Likewise, 
a threat to go around the SC in the freezeout context must still be subjected to shareholder approval through the 
tender offer route. 
This refinement would complement the change on MOM conditions proposed in the previous Subsection. If 
merger freezeouts will be increasingly subjected to MOM conditions, because of the benefit of business judgment 
review, then courts should be less determined to provide SCs with absolute veto power. Taken together, the 
proposed approach to merger freezeouts increases the procedural protection provided by MOM conditions and 
reduces (slightly) the procedural protection provided by SC approval. The combination more closely emulates the 
procedural protections that are inherent in the armslength merger process. 
Bolstering the tender offer threat in merger freezeouts would not drive prices in freezeout merger negotiations 
down toward market prices, as described in Subsection II.B.1.b. The reason is that the threatened tender offer 
would be subject to entire fairness review, due to the absence of SC approval. Entire fairness review detaches 
the price paid from market prices, which, in turn, reduces the incentives for inefficient opportunistic behavior by 
the controller. Therefore, the threat of a tender offer provides a controller a second opinion against an intransigent 
SC but would not allow the controller to pay a lower price. 
D. Synthesis 
Figure 1 summarizes the standards of judicial review that would apply according to the transaction structure and 
procedural protections that are included in the deal. The most important departures from existing doctrine in the 
application of entire fairness review (EFR) and business judgment review (BJR) are shaded on the right side of 
the chart. For fairness review, the party that has the burden of proof is indicated in parentheses. 
While the details are somewhat complicated, the proposal can be summarized with two simple points. First, a 
point on SC bargaining power: While SCs should have meaningful bargaining power against the controller, this 
bargaining power should be subject to the controller's right to proceed directly to minority shareholders through a 
tender offer freezeout (overruling aspects of Lynch). The controller should bear a cost, in terms of standards of 
review, from going around the SC, but this cost should not be prohibitive.

Page 26 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Second, a point on standards of judicial review: SC approval and a MOM condition should lead to business 
judgment review rather than entire fairness (again, overruling aspects of Lynch); SC approval or a MOM condition 
should shift the burden on entire fairness to the plaintiffs (following aspects of Lynch and Rosenblatt); and neither 
SC approval nor a MOM condition should trigger entire fairness review by the courts, with the burden on the 
defendants (overruling aspects of Siliconix). 
One way to think about these proposed reforms is that courts should step in to fill gaps, as needed, in the 
procedural protections that are provided to the minority shareholders. So, for example, if a freezeout receives SC 
approval but not minority shareholder approval, the court should review the transaction for fairness, with the 
burden on the plaintiff, to fill the shoes of the minority shareholders. Likewise if the SC does not approve the 
transaction but minority shareholders do, the court should step in to fill the SC's shoes, again with the burden on 
the plaintiff shareholders to show unfairness. If both the SC and minority shareholders approve, there are no gaps 
to fill and so the court should defer to the outcome of the process.245 
These proposed reforms would increase efficiency in the freezeout context in three important ways. First, by 
giving the SC meaningful bargaining power in tender offer freezeouts, the proposed reforms would reduce the 
controller's incentives to engage in opportunistic behavior and reduce (if not eliminate) the controller's ability to 
use nonpublic information to the detriment of the minority shareholders. Second, by softening the SC's unfettered 
veto power and by promoting MOM conditions in merger freezeouts, the proposed reforms would lower the 
procedural hurdles that currently deter some deals in this category. Putting these points together, a final benefit of 
the proposed reforms is convergence in the procedural protections provided to minority shareholders across 
transactional forms. This harmonization should eliminate the difference in freezeout outcomes and facilitate both 
transactional planning and the accurate valuation of a minority stake. 
E. Applications 
Thus far I have described my proposed reforms on a theoretical level. To see how these reforms might play out in 
real-world deals, I return to the two freezeout cases described in the Introduction: the Cox sisters' freezeout of the 
minority shareholders of Cox Communications in late 2004; and News Corporation's freezeout of the minority 
shareholders of Fox Entertainment Group in early 2005. Both targets were incorporated in Delaware. Both 
targets employed an SC of independent directors (three directors at Cox, two at Fox) that eventually approved the 
deal, and both deals included a MOM condition as a nonwaivable deal term. And, in the end, both deals were 
successful. But a critical difference lies in their choice of transactional form: Cox was a merger freezeout, while 
Fox was a tender offer freezeout. This difference allows an illustration of the full spectrum of reforms proposed in 
this Article. 
1. Cox Communications (August 2004) 
Cox Enterprises Inc. (CEI), 98% owned by the Cox sisters, announced its intention to freeze out the minority 
shareholders of Cox Communications Inc. (CCI) on August 2, 2004. In its press release CEI made clear that it 
was pursuing a merger freezeout, and that the CCI SC would have the ability to veto the deal.246 CEI offered $32 
cash per share for the minority shares, a 16% premium over the preannouncement trading price for CCI, or $7.9 
billion in total value. CCI formed an SC of the three directors on its board who were independent from CEI: Janet 
Clarke (chair), President of Clarke Littlefield LLC; Andrew Young, former mayor of Atlanta and former U.S. 
ambassador to the United Nations; and Rodney Schrock, CEO of Panasas, Inc.247 On August 17, the SC 
retained Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson as its legal advisor. 
On September 28, more than seven weeks after CEI's initial offer, the SC responded that $32 per share was 
inadequate and that "the Special Committee desired that CEI significantly increase its proposal."248 CEI 
increased its offer to $33.50 as its "highest and final offer."249 A stalemate then followed that loomed 
dangerously close to an impasse. Janet Clarke described her negotiations on October 15 with James Kennedy, 
the CEO of CEI, as follows: 
We stated that we had previously indicated that a $35 per Share price would not be acceptable. Mr. Kennedy 
stated that $34.50 was CEI's highest price and that CEI would withdraw its proposal if this price were not 
acceptable to us . . . . [Later that day] I told Mr. Kennedy that the Special Committee would not support a price 
lower than $35 per Share. Mr. Kennedy again stated that he was not willing to increase CEI's offer above $34.50 
per Share and was prepared to immediately withdraw CEI's proposal.250 
Note the way in which the shadow of merger-freezeout doctrine influenced this negotiation.251 CEI's "final and 
best" offer of $34.50 represented a 25% premium over the preannouncement price of CCI's minority shares, or 
$1.7 billion in aggregate additional value for the minority shareholders; yet at no point in the negotiation did CEI 
(through its CEO Kennedy) threaten to take its offer directly to the minority shareholders through a tender offer, 
likely due to the insistence in Lynch of "playing nicely" with the SC.252 In addition, the background legal rules

Page 27 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
forced CEI to negotiate with both the SC and Abbey Gardy, chair of the plaintiffs' committee, because the SC 
could not, through its approval, extinguish the plaintiffs' entire fairness claim. 
On the SC's side, Clarke and her colleagues made full use of their veto power, extending the negotiation for more 
than four months, and, in the endgame, threatening to walk away from $1.7 billion in an effort to extract an extra 
$123 million (50 cents per share) for the minority. In this case the brinksmanship tactic worked, at least in part: 
CEI increased its offer by an additional 25 cents per share, or $61 million, in order to reach an agreement with the 
SC and with plaintiffs' counsel. But the standard agency cost concerns that pervade so much of corporate law are 
at least lurking in the background here. Clarke, Young, and Schrock each earned $75,000 per year as board 
members of CCI,253 and, as is normally the case, did not join the CEI board after the freezeout.254 While this 
level of director compensation is well within the acceptable limits for companies like Cox and is unlikely to have 
had a significant influence on the SC's decision-making, it is clear that the financial incentives and other 
perquisites for the SC members created a structural incentive against the deal, at least at the margin. 
Consider the influence that the reforms proposed in this Article might have had in the Cox situation. First, CEI 
would have had greater bargaining power in the negotiation because it could have threatened to take its deal 
directly to the minority shareholders - that is, CEI's walk-away alternative would have been a tender offer 
freezeout rather than no deal. This subtle shift would increase the likelihood that value-creating freezeouts would 
be realized because the SC would be less likely to adopt brinksmanship tactics if it no longer had unchecked veto 
power over the deal. Reasoning back, a controller would be more likely to initiate a value-creating freezeout due 
to the reduced likelihood that an intransigent SC would hold up the deal. 
In situations where the controller actually made good on its threat to go to minority shareholders over the 
objection of the SC, the minority would be adequately protected through fairness review by the courts. The 
converse of this point is also critical: The controller could extinguish the class action fairness claim by gaining the 
SC's approval and subjecting the deal to a MOM condition. As a result, the litigation costs that arise under current 
doctrine would be reduced or eliminated. 
What difference would these reforms have made in the Cox situation? While any answer is of course speculative, 
one plausible scenario is that CEI would have made $34.50 its true "final and best" offer, coupled with a tender 
offer threat; in view of this credible threat the SC would have accepted the $34.50 offer, conditional on MOM 
shareholder approval; and, after the MOM vote, the transaction would have been subjected only to business 
judgment review. Relative to the actual outcome, this hypothesized outcome would have represented a transfer of 
$63 million (or 25 cents per share) from the minority to the controller, and a transfer of $1.3 million (the size of the 
court-approved attorneys' fee) from plaintiffs' counsel to the controller. More important than these wealth 
transfers, efficiency improvements would have arisen from the increased likelihood that controllers would initiate 
value-creating freezeouts and the increased likelihood that such deals, once initiated, would be successful. 
2. Fox Entertainment Group (January 2005) 
News Corporation's freezeout of the Fox Entertainment minority shareholders illustrates the other set of reforms 
proposed in this Article. On January 10, 2005, News announced its initial offer of 1.9 News shares for each Fox 
share, which represented a 7.4% premium over the preannouncement trading price for Fox. While News CFO 
David DeVoe declared that the offer represented "full and fair value for the Fox shareholders,"255 investors 
immediately denounced the premium as "a little thin"256 and "a little bit skinny."257 Consistent with the theory 
developed in this Article,258 some investors also claimed that News was acting opportunistically, freezing out the 
Fox minority shareholders while Fox was in a "rough patch."259 
From the outset, and in stark contrast to the Cox freezeout process, News made clear its intention to go forward 
with its offer regardless of whether Fox formed an SC, and, if an SC were formed, regardless of what the SC 
recommended.260 Despite this saber-rattling, just hours after the offer was announced Fox formed an SC 
consisting of the two directors on its board who were independent of News: Christos Cotsakos, former CEO of 
E*Trade, and Peter Powers, a strategy consultant who headed his own firm. Within one week the SC retained the 
Blackstone Group and Morgan Stanley as its financial advisors, and Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett as its legal 
advisor. On January 21, faced with the deadline for its initial 140-9 filing, the SC stated that it was not yet able to 
take a position on the offer. On February 25, the SC counteroffered with a 2.25 exchange ratio for the Fox shares. 
On March i, News indicated that it "might be willing to increase its exchange ratio to 2.00 plus possibly a very 
small additional increment if this would result in a favorable recommendation by the Special Committee."261 The 
next day the parties agreed on an exchange ratio of 2.04 News shares for each Fox share. The agreement was 
announced on March 3, and the deal closed on March 22, less than eleven weeks after the initial offer from News. 
Note the difficult bargaining situation that confronted the Fox SC. It could not hold up the deal; indeed, the tender 
offer was underway at the same time that the SC was attempting to extract a higher price from News. Plaintiffs'

Page 28 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
counsel, though present in this deal, had limited bargaining power as well because the Siliconix precedent 
eliminated entire fairness review for the transaction. Putting these points together, the Fox freezeout seems 
consistent with the theory developed in this Article that the binding constraint on News's final offer price was 
simply what the requisite fraction of the minority would accept-a "binary choice" that would not necessarily reflect 
"fair value" in the freezeout. Perhaps illustrating this point, the final premium paid to the Fox minority shareholders 
was 8.4% lower than the premium paid in Cox. Put differently, if the Fox minority had received the same premium 
as the Cox minority, they would have achieved an additional $504 million in total consideration from News.262 
More important than this wealth transfer, however, are the efficiency implications. Under the reforms proposed in 
this Article, the SC would have had greater bargaining power because News would only be able to avoid entire 
fairness review by gaining the SC's approval. As a result, News would want to gain SC approval in order to 
minimize or eliminate settlement value for plaintiffs' counsel. The implication is that at least one party with access 
to nonpublic information about the value of Fox would have had meaningful bargaining power against the 
controller: most likely the Fox SC, but alternatively plaintiffs' counsel (through discovery) or the Delaware courts 
(through a judicial determination on entire fairness). As a result, the incentives for News to engage in 
opportunistic behavior (as was alleged), or to initiate socially inefficient freezeouts, would be reduced, if not 
eliminated. 
CONCLUSION 
At its core, corporate law seeks to manage three basic relationships: between shareholders and managers; 
between shareholders and other constituencies; and between controlling shareholders and minority 
shareholders.263 While most corporate law commentary during the 1980s and 1990s focused on the first two of 
these three fundamental relationships, considerable attention has shifted recendy to the third. This shift has 
occurred in response to the Delaware courts' decisions in Siliconix and Glassman in the summer of 2001, as well 
as the increased economic significance of freezeouts in the aftermath of Sarbanes-Oxley. 
Despite the intensity of the debate on freezeout doctrine over the past four years, the case for change has never 
been made clear. By identifying an efficiency loss from existing doctrine, this Article makes the case for change. 
The current tender-offer-freezeout mechanism facilitates some inefficient (value-destroying) transactions by 
allowing the controller to exploit asymmetric information against the minority. In addition, the merger-freezeout 
mechanism deters some efficient (value-increasing) transactions because of the SC's veto power and the 
prospect of entire fairness review. Put simply, tender-offer-freezeout doctrine goes too far, and merger-freezeout 
doctrine does not go far enough, in facilitating freezeouts. Unlike deficiencies in most other areas of corporate law 
doctrine, this efficiency loss cannot be solved through private contracting between the controller and the minority. 
Thus, one contribution of this Article is that it identifies why we should try to fix freezeouts. 
This Article then takes up the challenge. Rather than proposing a patchwork solution, I propose a return to first 
principles of corporate law. At the highest level, I propose that minority shareholders should receive, to the extent 
possible, the same procedural protections that are built into the armslength merger process. In the freezeout 
context, this principle means approval by an SC of disinterested directors, to be followed by approval from a 
majority of the minority shareholders. If these procedural protections are met, courts should defer to the outcome 
and apply only business judgment review. If these procedural protections are not met, courts should step in to 
apply stringent entire fairness review. These reforms, which do not require legislative intervention, would reduce, 
if not eliminate, the efficiency loss that is inherent in existing doctrine. The result would be a more efficient 
ordering of U.S. companies between public and private status. 
Freezeout transactions, in which a controlling shareholder buys out the minority shareholders, have occurred 
more frequently since the stock market downturn of 2000 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While freezeouts 
were historically executed as statutory mergers, recent Delaware case law facilitates a new mechanism - 
freezeout via tender offer-by eliminating entire fairness review for these transactions. This Article identifies two 
social welfare costs of the current doctrinal regime. First, the tender-offer-freezeout mechanism facilitates some 
inefficient (value-destroying) transactions by allowing the controller to exploit asymmetric information against the 
minority. Second, the merger-freezeout mechanism deters some efficient (value-increasing) transactions because 
of the special committee's veto power against the deal. These negative wealth effects are unlikely to be resolved 
through private contracting between the controller and the minority in the corporate charter. Rather than 
advocating patchwork reforms to correct these problems, this Article proposes a return to first principles of 
corporate law in the freezeout context. The result of this re-grounding would be a convergence in judicial 
standards of review for freezeouts and the elimination of the efficiency loss that is inherent in the existing 
doctrine. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Has the dark cloud looming over big media finally lifted? 
After years of buffeted stock prices and failed attempts to placate restive investors, large media companies 
appear to be poised to regain their luster as the sector glimpses light at the end of what has been a long, dark 
tunnel. 
Much of the credit goes to a series of events that have taken place since March 13. They include the 
announcement by John Malone's Liberty Media that it will spin off its stake in Discovery Communications into a 
separately traded company; the confirmation from Viacom that it is exploring splitting its broadcast and cable 
assets into two publicly traded companies; the selection of Robert Iger as successor to outgoing Walt Disney Co. 
CEO Michael Eisner; the completion of an effort by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. to bring separately traded Fox 
Entertainment Group back into the News Corp. fold; and the settlement between Time Warner and the Securities 
and Exchange Commission over allegations of accounting fraud at Time Warner's America Online unit. 
At a minimum, each event signals that what was once business as usual at big media companies may no longer 
be the case. Indeed, analysts said the announcements by Liberty and Viacom have led executives at other large 
entertainment conglomerates to begin evaluating the long-term prospects of businesses within their own stables. 
Who can blame them? Large media company stocks have struggled for years as investors have grown tired of 
trying to decipher what critics have called convoluted asset mixes, in which high-growth businesses are 
obfuscated by businesses that either have slower growth or are in decline. These days, the idea of combining 
disparate assets is falling out favor as investors reward simplicity. 
``This trend may have been encouraged by the past year's stock price performance of pure-play entities,'' Merrill 
Lynch media analyst Jessica Reif Cohen noted in a recent report. She pointed out that animation companies 
Pixar and DreamWorks have seen their stock prices advance at rates three to four times better than those of 
traditional media giants. 
``We believe most of the large media companies will reconsider their asset mix to better appeal to large pools of 
investors,'' she added. 
Yet even if the top media companies are confronting the same kinds of questions, analysts and other experts say 
each will respond in its own way, in large part because each company faces its own unique set of challenges-and 
opportunities. 
The following is a look at what observers and analysts believe might be these companies' next moves in light of 
recent developments. 
Time Warner 
Financials (for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2004) 
Revenue: $42.1 billion versus $38.1 billion in 2003 
Net income (loss): $3.4 billion versus $2.6 billion in 2003

Page 31 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Big event: The company on March 21 reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over 
claims the company's America Online unit inflated revenue and subscriber numbers between 2000 and 2002. 
Time Warner agreed to pay the SEC $300 million. 
With the AOL accounting scandal officially behind it (Time Warner reached a similar settlement with the 
Department of Justice in December, agreeing to pay a $60 million fine and establishing a $150 million fund to 
compensate affected shareholders), analysts widely believe Time Warner is free to revisit the possibility of 
spinning off either its Time Warner Cable unit or perhaps even AOL. 
Time Warner first floated the idea of spinning off Time Warner Cable a few years ago, and was set to launch an 
initial public offering of the multiple system operator in 2003, but was forced to table the idea due to the SEC and 
Justice Department probes into AOL's accounting. However, in recent months the TWC IPO concept has gained 
strength as the accounting probe drew to a close and as Time Warner joined forces with Comcast Corp. to offer 
around $17.6 billion for bankrupt cable operator Adelphia Communications. 
These days, analysts believe Time Warner will spin off Time Warner Cable and combine it with Adelphia. From 
there, Comcast and Time Warner will negotiate a deal in which Comcast gets around 2 million basic cable 
subscribers in exchange for Comcast's 21 percent stake in Time Warner Cable, inherited when Comcast acquired 
AT&T Broadband in 2002, and maybe $1 billion cash. At present the Time Warner-Comcast bid is being 
evaluated by Adelphia. 
The scenario of spinning off AOL is less certain. With the AOL accounting scandal now history, Time Warner is 
free to explore selling the business, which has struggled as subscribers abandon its bread-and-butter dial-up 
service for broadband services offered by cable and telephone companies. However, Time Warner might wait a 
little bit longer for a more robust AOL recovery before considering a sale of the business, said Harold Vogel, CEO 
of Vogel Capital Management. 
News Corp. 
Financials (for the 12 months ended June 30, 2004) 
Revenue: $24.5 billion versus $20.1 billion the previous year 
Net income (loss): $1.6 billion versus $1.2 billion the previous year 
Big event: The company on March 21 completed its exchange offer to buy the 18 percent stake in separately 
traded Fox Entertainment Group that it didn't already own. 
Though many observers consider News Corp. one of the strongest-performing media companies around, there 
has been some concern over Liberty Media's recent stock purchases, which have given Liberty the 
second-highest voting control behind Mr. Murdoch and his family. With the Fox Entertainment issue resolved, 
there is a general sense News Corp. is now able to turn its attention to reducing Liberty's stake. 
How that might happen, however, is anyone's guess. Both Mr. Malone and Mr. Murdoch have reputations as 
tough negotiators, and it is unclear how this potential tussle might play out. That said, because the two men are 
keen on executing deals that are tax-efficient, a handful of possible scenarios are emerging. 
Merrill Lynch's Ms. Reif Cohen noted that News Corp. is sitting on a huge hoard of cash that could be used to buy 
back at least a portion of Liberty's stake in News Corp. Another option she believes possible is News Corp. selling 
off some of its television stations, particularly UPN affiliates and those Fox stations located in markets without 
football teams. 
Viacom 
Financials (for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2004) 
Revenue: $22.5 billion versus $26.6 billion in 2003 
Net income (loss): ($17.5 billion) versus $1.4 billion in 2003 
Big event: The company on March 16 confirmed rumors that it is exploring splitting its cable and movie operations 
from its television broadcast and radio businesses to create two publicly traded companies.

Page 32 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Having had more than a week to digest news of what Viacom is mulling over, Wall Street is growing more 
convinced that the Sumner Redstone-controlled media company will follow through with its breakup plan when it 
reaches a decision sometime in the second quarter. But that doesn't mean breaking up will be easy to do. 
A number of seasoned media executives examining a Viacom breakup more closely are beginning to question 
how the company is proposing to divvy up its assets, with a number of observers pointing out that if the company 
splits CBS from the cable networks, weaker channels such as Spike TV face a riskier future. 
``Spike survives only on `CSI' reruns, but that opportunity goes out the door'' if there's no link between Spike and 
CBS, said one media executive. ```CSI' could end up anyplace.'' 
More long term, a split-up of Viacom might not have any effect on the affected businesses' growth prospects, Mr. 
Vogel noted. 
``The growth will be whatever it is,'' he said. ``The basic assets and valuations [separated] will not be that much 
greater than where they are right now. They still live or die by what happens on the advertising side.'' 
Liberty Media Corp. 
Financials (for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2004) 
Revenue: $7.7 billion versus $4 billion in 2003 
Net income (loss): $46 million versus ($1.2 billion) in 2003 
Big event: The company on March 15 announced plans to combine its 50 percent stake in Discovery 
Communications with its 100 percent interest in programming services company Ascent Media to create a new 
publicly traded company, Discovery Holdings. 
With Liberty's stock price still failing to garner much respect from investors, a growing number of analysts and 
observers believe that the Discovery spinoff might be a precursor to the eventual breakup of the entire company. 
Liberty more than a year ago reorganized itself by creating three distinct operating units-one for interactive 
companies, another for its programming assets, including Discovery and Starz Encore Group, and a third for 
emerging businesses-and then set about becoming more of an operating company than merely a holder of stakes 
in other companies. The idea was to juice the stock, which had been penalized by investors who were unsure of 
what kind of company Liberty was. 
``Liberty has been frustrated at the lack of market understanding'' of its assets, said independent media analyst 
David Joyce, who also noted that Mr. Malone has publicly been more excited about the opportunities for growth 
internationally, where the cable business is far less mature than it is in the United States. 
The Walt Disney Co. 
Financials (for the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2004) 
Revenue: $30.8 billion versus $26.1 billion the previous year 
Net income (loss): $2.3 billion versus $1.3 billion the previous year 
Big event: The board of directors on March 13 named President and Chief Operating Officer Robert Iger as CEO 
effective Oct. 1, succeeding the embattled Michael Eisner, who will step down Sept. 30. 
Analysts and observers believe that installing Mr. Iger as CEO will go a long way toward settling the unrest that 
has plagued Disney for the past 18 months-and could even brighten the company's overall outlook. 
Mr. Iger, who was largely unknown until only recently, has won praise from analysts as he raised his profile during 
recent months-ostensibly preparing for the day he might be tapped to run the company-and cast himself as the 
even-tempered alternative to the mercurial Mr. Eisner. 
The strategy might work. Analysts believe Mr. Iger could be a key factor in repairing Disney's damaged 
relationship with animation powerhouse Pixar Animation, and in re-establishing ties with the creative community, 
which became alienated from Disney under Mr. Eisner's leadership.

However, it is unlikely that Disney will follow Viacom or Liberty's lead in splitting off assets in order to stoke its 
stock price. Aside from Disney's assets being seen as largely stable, Credit Suisse First Boston media analyst 
William Drewry pointed out that Mr. Iger might be keen on letting the dust settle following his arrival, rather than 
kicking up more dust by selling off assets.

News takes Fox stake to almost 99 per cent

News takes Fox stake to almost 99 per cent

News Corp's $US6.55 billion ($8.3 billion) play for the full control of Fox Entertainment has been concluded, 
paving the way for talks between Rupert Murdoch and Liberty Media about ownership of the media behemoth. 
News Corp said on Monday in the United States it had completed its acquisition of Fox Entertainment's minority 
shareholders and, as such, each Fox share tendered had been converted into 2.04 shares of News Corp limited 
voting stock. 
News Corp had originally offered 1.9 News Corp limited voting shares for every Fox share tendered but was 
forced to raise its offer after some minority shareholders launched legal action alleging the proposed transaction 
was "unfair and grossly inadequate". The special committee representing Fox minority shareholders had also 
pushed for a better offer. 
News Corp's offer, made in January, expired at midnight New York time on March 18 and News now owns and 
controls 98.8 per cent of all equity in Fox, up from 82.1 per cent. The 1.2 per cent of Fox's minority shareholders 
who did not take up News Corp's offer will now be compulsorily acquired. 
Liberty Media chairman John Malone said last week he would restart talks with Rupert Murdoch about selling, or 
swapping, his 18 per cent voting stake in News once the Fox deal went through. But he was cagey about what 
those talks would involve, although he indicated that he did not prefer a cash-rich asset swap with News Corp, 
which would deliver him cash and News Corp assets in return for his shares in Mr Murdoch's company. 
Market watchers have speculated that a cash-rich spin-off could involve News Corp placing cash and a non-core 
asset of Fox Entertainment in a separate company and trading that company for News Corp shares held by 
Liberty. 
US accountants have said that cash could account for as much as 90 per cent of the value of the company being 
swapped but that the business to be swapped would have to have been operated by News Corp for at least five 
years. News Corp would also have to show that it has a "corporate business objective" in the transaction and 
could expect the US Internal Revenue Service to look closely at any deal along those lines. 
Although such a deal would be a tax-effective way for Mr Malone to relinquish some or all of his News Corp 
holding, such a deal would arguably have to be done before October 1, the date when the US government has 
indicated the laws governing such deals will change. 
Mr Malone cannot increase his voting interest in News Corp because doing so would trigger the poison pill 
implemented by Mr Murdoch.

Shares in Fox Entertainment Group will cease trading today after Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation 
completed its buy-out of the television group's minority shareholders. 
News Corp spent Dollars 6.2bn to buy the 18.6 per cent of Fox that it did not already own. 
The media group had to raise its original exchange offer of 1.9 News Corp shares per Fox share to 2.04 after a 
number of Fox shareholders filed lawsuits. 
The completion of the deal, Mr Murdoch's latest move in an effort to simplify News Corp's corporate structure, 
opens the way for negotiations to start for Mr Murdoch to buy back the stake in News Corp owned by John 
Malone. 
Mr Malone, who runs Liberty Media, increased his voting shares in News Corp to 18 per cent last November, 
catching Mr Murdoch off guard while he was focused on switching the group's domicile from Australia to the US. 
Discussions about a deal are not expected to start for a number of weeks, people familiar with the situation said, 
not least because of Mr Murdoch's travel plans. He is currently in India. 
Mr Murdoch introduced a "poison pill" measure last year that meant Mr Malone could not accumulate more 
shares. 
Both executives have indicated they are in no hurry to reach a deal, although tax changes that are due to come 
into force in October could spur them to agree before then. 
Mr Malone's stake is believed to be worth Dollars 5bn-Dollars 7bn and most of it could be bought by Mr Murdoch 
in cash. 
A deal might include an asset swap to reduce tax payments, but this would be unlikely to be large relative to the 
cash component. 
Mr Malone has also taken steps to simplify his Liberty Media companies, including buying out minority 
shareholders. 
Last week, he announced the planned spin-off of two broadcast affiliates - Discovery and Ascent Media - in an 
effort to unlock greater value for shareholders.

Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. persuaded Fox Entertainment Group Inc. minority holders to accept 
US$6.6-billion for their stock, giving him full control of assets, including Fox News Channel and the 20th Century 
Fox film studio. 
Fox's investors will get US$36.72 a share in News Corp. non- voting shares for their stock, based on Friday's 
closing prices. Minority investors held 178.4 million shares, or 18% in Fox, and will get 2.04 News Corp. shares 
for each one of Fox. 
Purchasing the stock gives News Corp. all of Fox's US$12.2-billion in annual sales. 
Getting Fox businesses, including TV stations and the Fox sports cable channels, also gives Mr. Murdoch, 74, 
assets to trade with Liberty Media Corp. chairman John Malone to reduce Liberty's 18% voting stake in News 
Corp., said Peter Mirsky, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. 
"It brings all the assets under the right silos," Mr. Mirsky said in an interview before Mr. Murdoch's offer expired. 
He rates News Corp. a "buy" and doesn't own shares in the company. 
Separate Fox shares became unnecessary when News Corp. moved its headquarters to New York from Sydney 
in November, the company said when the offer was made on Jan. 10. News Corp. moved partly so it could be 
included in the Standard & Poor's 500 index and attract new investors, the company said in November. 
In December, Liberty exercised an option to trade non-voting News Corp. stock for an 18% voting stake. 
Mr. Murdoch, who controls 29.5% of News Corp.'s voting shares, said on Feb. 2 an agreement to reduce Mr. 
Malone's stake may be reached within nine months. 
Mr. Malone, 64, last week called Liberty's News Corp. holding a "strategic" investment and said he hadn't had 
"meaningful discussions" with News Corp. about reducing the stake. 
News Corp.'s class B voting shares rose US4 cents to US$18.36 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
They had fallen 4.6% this year before yesterday. News Corp.'s class A non-voting shares fell US11 cents to 
US$17.89. 
News Corp. first sold Fox shares to the public in November, 1998, raising US$2.18-billion by selling 20% of the 
company. Fox's stock has risen 63% since then. 
Fox shareholders resisted Mr. Murdoch's initial Us$5.86-billion offer, and News Corp. on March 3 raised the offer 
after agreeing to settle with stockholders who filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court to block the deal. 
The higher bid prompted a special committee of Fox's independent directors, Peter Powers and Christos 
Cotsakos, to recommend the offer. 
Fox generated 69% of News Corp.'s net income of US$1.6-billion for the year ended June 30 and 47% of sales. 
Fox's holdings include the Fox broadcast TV network, cable channels such as FX and a 34% interest in DirecTV 
Group Inc., the largest U.S. satellite-television provider.

The Fox network, started by Mr. Murdoch in 1987, won the "sweeps" rating period that ended on March 2 among 
18- to 49-year-old television viewers for the first time in two years, potentially enabling it to raise advertising 
prices. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Murdoch was scheduled yesterday to meet Indian government officials amid expectations that the 
chairman of News Corp. is close to winning a licence to broadcast directly into homes, cutting out the monopoly of 
local cable operators. 
Executives from Star, Mr. Murdoch's pan-Asian broadcasting unit, believe they have complied with tough 
regulatory conditions that have held up their joint bid with Tata Group. 
Star holds 20% and a unit of the Tata steel-to-cars conglomerate owns the rest. If the deal is given the green 
light, it would trigger capital investment of US$400-million, according to one banker. 
Direct-to-home broadcasting could benefit broadcasters by allowing them to leap-frog the monopoly interests of 
India's under-regulated 30,000 cable operators, which control the last mile delivery of satellite transmissions. 
Broadcasters have lobbied for direct-to-home transmission because the move would also open the vast rural 
market of potential TV viewers.

NEW YORK -- Fox Entertainment Group is back at home in Rupert Murdoch's hen house. 
With little fanfare or trouble, Murdoch's News Corp. on Monday completed its acquisition of Fox Entertainment, 
meaning Fox won't be listed on the New York Stock Exchange as of this morning. 
Wall Streeters had complained it was too confusing to have News Corp. -- now a corporate resident of the U.S. -- 
and Fox Entertainment traded separately on the NYSE. 
Fox's divisions include 20th Century Fox, the Fox Broadcasting network and cable nets such as FX and Fox 
News Channel. Management structure at Fox Entertainment won't change as a result of the absorption. 
Murdoch spun Fox Entertainment off as a public U.S. company in 1998 so American institutional investors -- 
which are barred from buying stock in a foreign interest -- might stake a claim in his Australian-based empire. 
At the time, News Corp. sold off an 18% stake in Fox Entertainment in an initial public offering. 
Buying back that stock cost News Corp. between $6.2 billion and $6.3 billion. 
Deal sweetener 
After numerous shareholder lawsuits were filed objecting to News Corp.'s initial price offer, conglom sweetened 
its deal, with investors scoring an extra 7% to hand over their Fox shares. 
Under the terms of the stock swap, News Corp. gave Fox shareholders 2.04 shares of News Corp. for every 
share of Fox Class A common stock, up from 1.90 shares of News Corp. 
All told, 414,889,385 shares of Fox Class A stock were tendered in the exchange. 
News Corp. shares were up 4¢ to close at $18.36 in trading Monday. In their final day of trading, Fox 
Entertainment shares were down 40¢ to close at $36.35. 
With the buyback complete, Murdoch is now expected to turn his full attention to reclaiming John Malone's stake 
in News Corp. 
As Murdoch was reincorporating News Corp. to the U.S. at the end of last year, Malone's Liberty Media snapped 
up enough additional voting stock to give Malone an 18% stake in Murdoch's company. 
That's uncomfortably close to the Murdoch family's 30% stake. 
Murdoch and Malone haven't had any discussions since late last year. Nor are any scheduled in the coming days. 
Murdoch, who is in India, is expected to return to New York in early April.

SAN FRANCISCO (XFN-ASIA) -- DirecTV, the nation's No. 1 satellite broadcaster, said Thursday it has tapped 
Fox Sports Chairman David Hill to run its newly formed entertainment unit. DirecTV is controlled by Rupert 
Murdoch's News Corp. , the parent of Fox Entertainment Group. As president of the entertainment unit, Hill will 
oversee all programming and development, and the marketing and promotion of the DirecTV service to 
consumers. Hill will also be in charge of new services, and will be charged with expanding the company's 
advertising sales operations. He will still remain a non-executive chairman of Fox Sports. Also Thursday, DirecTV 
said Chief Financial Officer Mike Palkovic will have his role expanded to include oversight over the entire DirecTV 
organization. News Corp. shares rose 27 cents to $18 on Thursday, while DirecTV picked up 2 cents to close at 
$14. 68. This story was supplied by MarketWatch.

BRISBANE, March 15 AAP - Rupert Murdoch's New Corp Inc is another step closer to wresting full ownership of 
its US subsidiary Fox Entertainment Group. 
News Corp said today it had completed a previously announced internal restructure and received a private letter 
ruling from the US Internal Revenue Service relating to the buy-out. 
The company said the completion of the two criteria were both conditions to the exchange offer of News Corp 
shares for Fox shares. 
But it said the 100 per cent acquisition remains subject to other conditions, including the tender of the shares that 
it wants to purchase prior to the closure of its offer on Friday. 
In January News Corp moved to consolidate its complex global structure by swapping its own stock for the 17.9 
per cent of Fox shares it did not own. 
But about 17 shareholder lawsuits were filed to block the deal offering 1.90 News Corp Class A common stock for 
every share of Fox Class A common stock. 
Earlier this month the global media conglomerate raised its offer to Fox shareholders to 2.04 News Corp shares 
for each Fox share. 
News Corp described the offer as a logical step since the media group's reincorporation in the United States in 
November 2004 meant it reduced the need to have a separate listing for Fox. 
The company owns 82.1 per cent of the equity and 97 per cent of the voting power of Fox. 
Shaw Stockbroking media analyst Greg Fraser said with News Corp relocating on the US stock exchange, the 
deal will simplify the company's structure. 
He said the lucrative film and television company that includes 20th Century Fox film studios among its assets 
was a vital part of the News Corp empire. 
"It really is a tidy up for the company which has redomiciled in the US and wants to attract greater US 
investment," he said. 
"It's interesting that the closure of the offer is on March 18 when the stock will be reweighted in Australia." 
News Corp's weighting on the Australian Stock Exchange shrinks by another 25 per cent after the close of trading 
on Friday, as part of its staged removal from key local market indices. 
News Corp shares advanced four cents to $22.34 while its preferred scrip added nine cents to $21.84.

Rupert Murdoch's New Corp Inc has come a step closer to full ownership of US subsidiary Fox Entertainment

News Corp announced that it has completed a previously announced internal restructure and received a private 
letter ruling from the US Internal Revenue Service relating to the reshuffle. 
"The completion of the internal restructuring transactions and the receipt of the IRS private letting ruling are both 
conditions to the completion of News Corporation's previously announced exchange offer for Fox Entertainment 
Group Inc's class A common stock that News Corporation does not already own," News Corp said. 
News Corp said, however, that the Fox acquisition remains subject to other conditions, including the tender of the

In January, News Corp moved to consolidate its complex global structure by swapping its own stock for the 17.9

News Corp presented the deal as a tidy-up operation that gave it 100 per cent control of the lucrative film and

It described the offer as a logical step since the media group's reincorporation in the United States in November 
2004 meant it reduced the need to have a separate listing for Fox. 
News Corp, which already owned 82.1 per cent of the equity and 97 per cent of the voting power of Fox, offered 
1.9 of its non voting shares for every Fox share. 
Fox minority shareholders accepted the $6 billion offer, which values each Fox share at $US33.50 and increases 
the number of non-voters on issue by 17 per cent.

NEW YORK (AP) - News Corp. on Monday said it completed internal restructuring and received the required 
private-letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service relating to its plan to buy out the shares of Fox 
Entertainment Group Inc. it does not already own. 
The global media conglomerate, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, has offered to pay Fox shareholders 2.04 shares 
of News Corp. Class A common stock for every common Fox share. News Corp. increased the offer earlier this 
month when Fox shareholders balked that the deal was not worth enough. 
News Corp. said the buyout depends on other conditions, including a stock tender offer that must be valid by 
March 18. 
The acquisition of News Corp. comes as the media powerhouse attempts to revamp its capital structure after it 
reincorporated itself in the United States from Australia last year. Fox was launched in 1985 as a challenger to 
mainstream television networks, offering such hits as "The Simpsons" and "Married, With Children." 
Shares of Fox Entertainment closed up 30 cents at $35.35. News Corp. shares rose 14 cents to close at $17.72. 
Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

NEWS Corporation has raised its offer price to buy the rest of Fox Entertainment Group after talks with Fox 
shareholders who had sued it over the deal, sending Fox shares up 4 per cent. 
The global media conglomerate, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said it was now offering to pay Fox shareholders 
2.04 shares of News Class A common stock for every share of Fox Class A common stock, up from an earlier 
offer of 1.90 News shares. 
The new offer, which is for the 18.6 per cent stake of Fox that News does not already own, represents a 5 per 
cent premium over Fox's closing price on Wednesday of $US33.63. 
It represents a 13 per cent premium from the last trading day before the announcement of the original offer. 
Fox shares rose $US1.45 to $US35.08 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier reaching 
a record $35.17. On the Australian market yesterday, News Corp ordinary shares closed more than 2 per cent up, 
adding 47 to $22.75.

The News Corporation, the media company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, raised its offer for full ownership of 
the Fox Entertainment Group yesterday by 7 percent, to $6 billion. 
A committee of Fox directors endorsed the higher offer, and shareholders that sued to block the purchase agreed 
to a settlement, the News Corporation said. Mr. Murdoch offered 2.04 Class A nonvoting shares in the News 
Corporation for each Fox Class A share, up from a Jan. 10 offer of 1.9 shares. 
Purchasing the 18 percent of Fox stock it does not own will give Mr. Murdoch's company all of Fox's $12.2 billion 
in annual sales and provide complete control of assets that include the 20th Century Fox film studio, Fox News 
Channel and 35 television stations in the United States. Fox accounts for 75 percent of the company's revenue. 
The transaction may also give Mr. Murdoch flexibility to trade Fox assets like cable channels and TV stations with 
John C. Malone, chairman of Liberty Media, to reduce Mr. Malone's 18 percent voting stake in the News 
Corporation. Mr. Murdoch said Feb. 2 that an agreement to cut Mr. Malone's stake might be reached within nine 
months. 
The offer, first made in January, was extended until March 18, the News Corporation said. 
The News Corporation's offer values each Fox share at $34.27, based on Wednesday's closing stock price. Fox's 
stock rose $1.44, to $35.07.

NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - News Corp. (NWS.N) on Thursday raised its offer price to buy the rest of Fox 
Entertainment Group (FOX.N), after talks with Fox shareholders who had sued it over the deal, sending shares 
of Fox up more than four percent. 
The global media conglomerate, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said it is now offering to pay Fox shareholders 
2.04 shares of News Corp. Class A common stock for every share of Fox Class A common stock, up from an 
earlier offer of 1.90 News Corp. shares. 
The new offer, which is for the 18.6 percent stake in Fox that News Corp. does not already own, represents a 5 
percent premium over Fox's closing price on Wednesday of $33.63. It represents a 13 percent premium from the 
last trading day before the announcement of the original offer. 
Shares of Fox ended up $1.44 to $35.07 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier reaching a record high of 
$35.28. News Corp. shares ended 46 cents higher at $17.77. 
About 17 shareholder lawsuits were filed to block the deal, charging News Corp. with lowballing Fox 
shareholders. 
News Corp. on Thursday also said it has reached a settlement in principle with the consolidated shareholder 
lawsuits. The company in its statement did not provide details of the agreement. 
News Corp., which said the offer was increased after talks with a special committee of Fox's board comprised 
solely of independent directors and plaintiffs in the lawsuits, said the special committee plans to recommend that 
Fox shareholders accept the offer. 
The deadline to accept the offer is March 18. 
News Corp. is aiming to tidy up its capital structure to make future transactions easier to accomplish, analysts 
have said. It currently owns about 82 percent of the equity value of Fox and about 97 percent of the voting power. 
News Corp. sold an 18.6 percent stake in Fox Entertainment in an initial public offering in late 1998 as a way for 
U.S. institutional shareholders forbidden from buying shares of a foreign company to invest in a U.S.-based 
property controlled by News Corp. 
With the reincorporation of News Corp. in the United States late last year, it made little sense to maintain two 
publicly traded U.S. entities.

News Corp's raised offer could succeed - FOX BUY-OUT.

News Corp's increased offer to Fox Entertainment Group minority shareholders make it likely the buy-out will be 
accepted, and that Rupert Murdoch will turn his attention to making a deal with John Malone's Liberty Corp. 
Fox shareholders were yesterday offered an extra 7 per cent to agree to sell their 18 per cent stake to News 
Corp, which wants full control of the group in an effort to simplify its corporate structure. 
Completion of the Fox transaction, scheduled for March 18, is seen as a precursor to talks starting between Mr 
Murdoch and Mr Malone, who last year upped his voting stake in News Corp to 18 per cent. 
"Liberty is, obviously, next on the agenda," said a person familiar with plans. 
News Corp increased the exchange ratio offer for its proposed buy-in of Fox to 2.04 times from 1.9 times. 
Independent directors have recommended this offer to shareholders. A class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Fox 
shareholders who felt the original offer was too low has been settled in principle, New Corp said. 
"The increased bid and recommendation from independent shareholders greatly increases the chance of 
success," said CSFB analysts. "It may also pave the way for easier negotiations with Liberty." 
Mr Malone, a veteran media mogul who has long sparred with Mr Murdoch, took his rival by surprise last year 
when he increased his voting stake in News Corp. He took advantage of large share sales that took place during 
News Corp's change of domicile from Australia to the US. 
Mr Murdoch introduced a "poison pill" measure that meant Mr Malone could not accumulate more shares. 
The two executives had brief telephone conversations last year about a deal but have not started serious 
negotiations. Bankers said Mr Malone's stake was probably worth Dollars 5bn to Dollars 7bn and most of it would 
be bought by Mr Murdoch in cash. 
A deal would have to include an asset swap to reduce tax payments, but such an asset swap was unlikely to be 
large relative to the cash component. 
Mr Malone has taken steps to simplify his Liberty Media companies. In January Liberty Media International made 
a Dollars 3.5bn buy-out offer for outright control of UnitedGlobalCom (UGC), its European cable affiliate, which 
owns cable operator Chorus.

LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - Fox Television Studios, part of Rupert Murdoch's global media empire, said on 
Wednesday it had purchased a UK production company that makes celebrity-heavy documentaries such as 
"Prince Harry: Laid Bare." 
Terms of the deal to buy Scream Films, which had revenues of less than 4 million pounds ($7.7 million) last year, 
were not disclosed. 
Fox Television Studios, a unit of the News Corp-controlled (NWS.N) Fox Entertainment Group (FOX.N), said 
that Scream Films would "continue to be run with the independence that has established it as a key UK player". 
Scream Films' programmes, which have also included "Planet's Funniest Animals" and the in-production "White 
Collar Boxing", have appeared on UK channels such as Sky One, ITV and Living TV.

Fox Board Rubber-Stamped Murdoch's $5.9 Billion Bid, Suits Say 
Fox Board Rubber-Stamped Murdoch's $5.9 Billion Bid, Suits Say

Disgruntled shareholders filed a dozen lawsuits within 48 hours after Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. offered $5.9 
billion Jan. 10 to buy out the public shareholders of subsidiary Fox Entertainment Group. 
The suits accuse the Fox Entertainment directors of breaching their duty to minority shareholders by 
rubber-stamping an "unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate" bid for an asset that produces 75 percent of 
Murdoch's income. 
Janice Allen and 11 other shareholders who filed actions nearly identical to hers ask the Delaware Chancery 
Court to enjoin the deal, in which Fox shareholders will get 1.9 shares of News Corp. for each of their shares, or 
about $32.55 apiece based on stock prices at the time of the offer. 
However, the plaintiffs face an uphill battle, since media mogul Murdoch already controls more than 80 percent of 
the voting shares of Fox, according to court filings. Under the corporate law of Delaware, where both companies 
are chartered, that "supermajority" voting power allows controlling shareholders to buy up the rest of the publicly 
held shares of a company without having to prove that the minority will get the best price possible for their stock. 
News Corp., in which Murdoch owns a majority share, is an international media and entertainment company and 
the parent of Fox Entertainment, an American television and film conglomerate that owns the 20th Century Fox 
studio and the Fox News Channel. 
Allen and the other shareholder plaintiffs claim that the value of Murdoch's proposed stock swap is only 
marginally higher than Fox's current market price. Normally, in return for acquiring a controlling share - or in this 
case, complete ownership - of a company, the acquirer offers an incentive to the shareholders that raises the 
offer substantially above the market price, plaintiffs claim. 
Allen's lawsuit charges that Murdoch, as CEO and board chairman of both News Corp. and Fox, controls the 
boards of both companies and has influenced the Fox board members to breach their fiduciary duty of loyalty to 
the shareholders. 
The suit also names Murdoch's son Lachlan, an officer of News Corp. and a director of Fox; Fox president Peter 
Chernin; David Devoe, the CFO of both Fox and News Corp.; News Corp. general counsel Arthur Siskind; and a 
number of other Fox directors. 
"The individual defendants have breached their duties of loyalty and care by not taking adequate measures to 
ensure that the interests of Fox Entertainment's public shareholders are properly protected from overreaching," 
Allen's suit says. "The terms of the transaction are grossly unfair to the class and the unfairness is compounded 
by the gross disparity between the knowledge and information possessed by defendants by virtue of their position 
of control ... and the public shareholders." 
According to published reports, Devoe said offering Fox stock to the public in 1988 was "a way to drive value into 
the stock" but it is time to fold the company back into News Corp. He reportedly said the shareholder complaints 
will not result in a higher offer and that the merger will save between $3 million and $7 million in legal, auditing 
and other costs. 
In addition to Allen, complaints were filed by John Mascarenhas, Roy Shemesh, Jean Striffler, the Howard Vogel 
Retirement Plan, Bruce Doniger, Paul Engel, William Shrank, Charles Blackman, Janet Fishbone, Elmore Kennel 
and Gordon Millner.

NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - News Corp. (NWS.N) on Wednesday said a hearing has been delayed on a 
lawsuit aimed at halting the buyback of the company's stake in its Fox Entertainment (FOX.N) unit. 
The hearing in Delaware Chancery Court, in which shareholders are requesting a preliminary injunction, was 
originally scheduled for March 1. The buyback offer expires at midnight March 4, but the company expects to 
extend the expiration to a date after the hearing. 
News Corp. is in the process of buying back shares of Fox it does not own, or about 18 percent, to clean up its 
capital structure that could make future transactions easier to complete. 
Some Fox investors have balked at the price News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch offered to pay. News Corp has 
offered to swap 1.90 shares of News Corp class A shares for every share of Fox. The estimated $6 billion deal 
valued Fox shares at $33.54, representing a 7.4 percent premium to Fox shares as of Jan. 7. 
News Corp. disclosed in February that it is currently aware of 17 Fox shareholder suits to block the deal. 
Fox shares gained 9 cents to $33.04 and News Corp shares fell 5 cents at $16.96 in afternoon trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. last Monday extended for the second time the deadline for an exchange offer that 
would return full ownership of Fox Entertainment Group to News Corp., citing as reason for the extension a 
hearing next month to address some shareholders' objections to the offer. 
The Delaware Court of Chancery is scheduled to hold a hearing March 1 on a request by several shareholders 
unhappy with News Corp.'s offer who asked that the transaction be blocked. In light of the hearing, News Corp. 
pushed to March 4 the deadline by which FEG shareholders can exchange their shares in FEG for stakes in 
News Corp. The original deadline was Feb. 4, but it was changed to Feb. 22. 
About 17 shareholder suits have been filed to block News Corp. from moving forward with the $6 billion offer, 
which would pay FEG shareholders $33.54 per share-an offer some stockholders consider too low. 
News Corp. owns a controlling 82 percent of FEG, which went public in 1998 as a way for News Corp. to tap U.S. 
capital markets. However, at the end of last year News Corp. changed its residency to the United States from 
Australia, obviating the need for FEG to remain public. 
News Corp. officials have maintained that the offer presently on the table is fair and final. In a statement issued 
Feb. 7, the company said of the upcoming hearing that it ``believes that these [shareholders'] claims are without 
merit and intends to vigorously contest such allegations.''

News Corp has been forced to extend its exchange offer a second time for the shares in Fox Entertainment 
Group it does not already own, after a United States court granted a hearing to investors challenging the offer. 
The media group's $US5.8 billion ($7.5 billion) bid to use its own shares to buy back the 17.9 per cent of Fox 
shares it does not already own, has now been extended to March 4. 
The offer, which was due to close last Monday, has been delayed until after a hearing in the Court of Chancery in 
Delaware on March 1 to rule on a motion for a preliminary injunction on the News offer. 
In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, News said it was aware of 17 purported class action 
complaints challenging the offer. 
It said all of the complaints generally alleged, among other things, that News and board members breached 
fiduciary duties by offering to acquire Fox minority shares at an unfair price, appointing directors who were neither 
independent nor disinterested to a special committee created to consider the offer and failing to adequately 
disclose information material to the offer. 
Fox's two independent directors have yet to say whether they think News's offer is fair. However, the company's 
chief financial officer, David DeVoe, has said the deal could go ahead even if the special committee 
recommended against it. 
It is believed the exchange offer will smooth the way for an anticipated scrip and asset swap between News and 
Liberty Media. 
News chief Rupert Murdoch last week said he was confident of reaching a "friendly and fair resolution" with 
Liberty, which owns 18 per cent of News's voting stock. 
News's voting and non-voting shares in Australia and the US have fallen about 9 per cent since late December 
because of the share overhang. The Australian voting stock were steady at $22.90 yesterday; the non-voting 
stock edged up 1c to $22.06.

News Corporation will go before a judge next month in an effort to put an end to lawsuits filed by some Fox 
Entertainment shareholders which say its offer to acquire full control of Fox is too low. 
The court date has been set for March 1, and News Corp has extended its Dollars 6bn Fox exchange offer 
deadline to March 4, the second time the date has been moved forward. 
In January, News Corp, the media and entertainment group led by Rupert Murdoch, offered shares to Fox 
shareholders to consolidate its US media holdings in the US. News Corp already controls 82.1 per cent of Fox's 
equity and 97 per cent of its voting shares. 
About 17 lawsuits have been filed to block the offer, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
News Corp says the claims - which are a common response to buy-out offers - are without merit and expects to 
go ahead with the buy-out shortly after the Delaware court hearing. 
The buy-out is part of Mr Murdoch's effort to simplify New Corp's structure, potentially easing a deal to acquire 
News Corp shares held by Liberty Media. 
The current proposal is for holders of Fox class A shares to get shares in News Corp on a 1.9-for-1 ratio. 
A special committee of two independent directors is expected to provide a recommendation to shareholders in the 
next week or two and they might suggest a slightly higher offer, with analysts predicting a 2-for-1 ratio. Aline van

News on the defence Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Inc said yesterday it would vigorously defend a challenge to 
its bid for the remainder of Fox Entertainment Group. The media company moved last month to consolidate its 
complex global structure by swapping $US5.86billion ($A7.6billion) worth of its own stock for the 17.9 per cent of

Airlines renew alliance The consumer watchdog approved yesterday the renewal of a services alliance between 
Qantas Airways Ltd and British Airways on the so-called kangaroo route between Australia and Britain. The 
outcome has disappointed Virgin Atlantic and Singapore Airlines, which had argued that the joint services 
agreement was anti- competitive. Under the 10-year agreement, Qantas and BA are allowed to coordinate 
scheduling, marketing, sales, freight and consumer services.

NEW YORK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - News Corp. said it extended an exchange offer deadline to March 4 for Fox 
Entertainment Group Inc. shares it does not already own, as some shareholders seek to thwart the estimated $6 
billion stock swap. 
On March 1, the media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch is expected to go before a judge in 
Delaware Chancery Court who will rule on a preliminary injunction to block the deal, the company said in a filing 
late Monday. 
About 17 lawsuits have been filed to thwart News' offer, according to a News filing with the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
"News Corporation believes that these claims are without merit and intends to vigorously contest such 
allegations," the company said in a statement. 
News in January offered to purchase shares of Fox it does not already own, or about 18 percent, in a deal valuing 
the stock at $33.54 a share. The company has said it is aiming to simplify its capital structure with hopes to make 
future acquisitions easier to accomplish. 
The price represented a 7.4 percent premium to its prior trading day stock price of $31.22. Some shareholders 
have complained it was a low-ball offer, as Fox shares have traded above the offer price in recent weeks. 
Fox shares fell 26 cents to $33.85, while News stock dipped 14 cents to $17.53, both on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

"News Corporation believes that these claims are without merit and intends to vigorously contest such

Also today, News Corp extended the bid for Fox until midnight on March 4, 2005. 
The media group has presented the offer as a tidy-up operation that would give it 100 per cent control of the 
lucrative film and television company that includes 20th Century Fox film studios among its assets. 
News Corp, which owns 82.1 per cent of the equity and 97 per cent of the voting power of Fox, is offering 1.9 of 
its non voting shares for every Fox share. 
There has been a slow takeup of the offer, but News Corp said it has always expected a last minute rush to close 
the deal.

News Corp has extended the deadline to take full control of its subsidiary Fox Entertainment Group, with its offer 
to minority shareholders now open until February 22. 
The company, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, did not explain what lay behind its decision on Friday to change 
the deadline, originally February 7. 
Fox's two independent directors have asked for more time to decide whether or not the offer is fair. Their approval 
is not required, however. 
Earlier this month, News offered 1.9 of its non-voting class A common shares for each outstanding class A 
common share in Fox. 
That valued the 17.9 per cent of Fox shares News did not already own at $US5.8 billion ($7.5 billion) and 
represented a 7.4 per cent premium to Fox's closing price at the time. Fox controls Fox Television Network, Fox 
cable channels and the 20th Century Fox movie studio, and has $US31 billion in assets. 
In a conference call with investors and analysts after the offer was announced, News brushed off complaints the 
premium was "skinny", and denied the purchase was a precursor to a deal with John Malone's Liberty Media. 
Some analysts say it makes sense for News to take full control of Fox. Others argue there is no obvious financial 
imperative. 
In a statement released in New York on Thursday, the company said that only 139,994 Fox shares had been 
tendered to News. However, it had not expected the majority of shares would be tendered until the final few days 
before the original expiry date. 
In another development, the Bush administration on Thursday reportedly backed away from further media 
ownership deregulation, leaving media groups to push the issue without government support. 
In 2003, the US Federal Communications Commission allowed media groups to own more TV companies and 
more combinations of newspapers, TV and radio stations in the same market. An appeals court ruling eventually 
stopped the changes from becoming law.

News Corp. extends offer for Fox to Feb. 22 SAN FRANCISCO (XFN-ASIA) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. on 
Thursday extended its exchange offer for the 82 percent of Fox Entertainment Group it doesn't already own to 
Feb. 22 from the original date of Feb. 7. No reason for the extension was given. About 139,994 shares of Fox 
Class A common stock have been tendered to News Corp. in the exchange offer, News said. Fox Entertainment 
Group includes the Twentieth Century Fox film and television studios, Fox Broadcasting, various cable networks, 
and other assets. News Corp. currently owns about 82.1 percent of the equity and 97 percent of the voting power 
of Fox through its ownership of 59.1 percent of the company's Class A stock and 100 percent of its Class B stock. 
Fox shares have generally traded at a significant discount to News Corp., a pattern that has been consistent 
since Fox was spun off from News in 1998. 
News Corp., founded in Australia and headquartered there for many years, recently reincorporated in the U.S. 
The Fox spinoff was partially done to offer an investment vehicle for people who only wanted to invest in the 
company's U.S. assets. Shares of Fox rose 3 cents to close at $33.70, while News Corp. fell 1 cent to $17.65.

NEWS SYDNEY, Jan 27 AAP - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Inc today extended its $US5.86 billion bid for the 
remainder of Fox Entertainment Group. 
The media company moved earlier this month to consolidate its complex global structure by swapping its own 
stock for the 17.9 per cent of Fox shares it does not already own. 
News Corp presented the deal as a tidy-up operation that gave it 100 per cent control of the lucrative film and 
television company that includes 20th Century Fox film studios among its assets. 
It described the offer as a logical step since the media group's reincorporation in the United States in November 
2004 meant it reduced the need to have a separate listing for Fox. 
News Corp, which owns 82.1 per cent of the equity and 97 per cent of the voting power of Fox, is offering 1.9 of 
its non voting shares for every Fox share. 
The exchange offer, which was scheduled to expire at midnight, New York City time, on February 7 has been 
extended until midnight on February 22, 2005. 
News Corp said it anticipated the vast majority of the Fox shares it wanted would be tendered in the final few 
days of the exchange offer.

News Corp.'s proposal last week to buy the 18% of Fox Entertainment Group it doesn't already own came as 
little surprise, but the timing signals News chairman Rupert Murdoch is unconcerned about any looming 
takeover threat from Liberty Media Corp. chief John Malone. 
Malone, chairman of Liberty and a longtime Murdoch confidant, shocked News Corp. and the analyst community 
in November when Liberty announced a deal with Merrill Lynch International that would increase its voting stake 
in News Corp. from 9% to 17%. That deal was completed in December. 
PILL FOR COMFORT 
While Liberty said the transaction was merely a financial move, some observers took it as a signal that Malone 
would attempt a takeover of News, or would use the voting stake  second only to Murdoch's 30%  as 
leverage to force an asset swap between the two media giants. 
News Corp. implemented a poison pill days after the Liberty announcement that would trigger if any individual 
tried to buy more than a 15% voting stake in the company. 
Murdoch has shrugged off speculation of a falling out with Malone  although some close to the company have 
said the chairman was surprised by Liberty's move  and has said publicly that he had no fears that Malone 
would attempt buy more voting stock. 
He apparently backed that up with the Fox tender offer. 
Most analysts had expected News Corp. to wait six to nine months before making the Fox tender, when the 
company could get a better price for the shares. Now, most analysts expect News Corp. to raise its offer for Fox, 
although News has said its offer stands. 
In a research report, Lehman Bros. analyst Vijay Jayant wrote that the tender offer was a little low. 
In his report, Jayant said that News Corp. could offer a premium as high as 14.8% without it being dilutive to 
earnings. 
According to the deal, Fox shareholders would receive 1.9 shares of News Corp. stock for every Fox share they 
own. 
The deal, valued at close to $6 billion, represents a 7.4% premium ($33.54 per share) to Fox's trading price on 
Jan. 7 and a 16.9% premium to Fox's six-month average trading price. 
Fox shares surged on the offer, which has been expected for months. Fox shares were up 9.8% ($3.06) on Jan. 
10 to $34.28. The stock stayed steady at $34.27 on Jan. 12. 
News Corp. stock, which dropped nearly 3% (38 cents) to $17.85 each on Jan. 10, rose slightly to $18.06 on Jan. 
12. 
The deal has been expected since News Corp. reincorporated in the United States late last year. News Corp. 
owns 82% of Fox's outstanding shares and 97% of the company's vote. 
LOGIC IS GONE

News Corp. sold 18% of Fox Entertainment to the public in 1998, mainly as a way to drive value into the News 
Corp. stock by giving the media giant a U.S.-based security that could be purchased by institutional investors  
News Corp. was an Australia-based company until the domicile shift to Delaware in December. Since the 
reincorporation of News Corp. into the United States, the logic for Fox really no longer exists, News Corp. chief 
financial officer David DeVoe said on a conference call with analysts.

NEWS Corporation has had informal talks with Liberty Media about buying back Liberty's 18 per cent voting stake 
in Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate. 
News Corp president Peter Chernin, speaking at an investor conference, said he would consider a share 
buyback. 
His remarks came two days after the company said it would buy back the 18 per cent of shares it did not already 
own in Fox Entertainment Group in a stock swap worth $US6 billion ($A7.8 billion). 
Mr Chernin spoke broadly about News Corp's 2005 plans, which include using DirecTV as a vehicle to launch 
new cable networks, News Corp's interest in buying a video game company, and early discussions on launching a 
sports cable channel. 
Liberty, controlled by cable pioneer John Malone, recently raised its voting stake in News to 18 per cent, 
prompting News to enact a poison pill measure that makes a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive. 
"It's an overstatement that negotiations have been going on," Mr Chernin said at the conference. 
"There have been a couple of informal conversations." 
He said News Corp had not negotiated a standstill agreement with Liberty that would have prevented Liberty from 
buying more shares of the company "because we have a poison pill". 
Liberty chief executive Robert Bennett told an investor conference last month that there had been conversations 
between Liberty and News Corp, but did not elaborate. 
One possibility mulled over by analysts involves a corporate tax loophole called a "cash-rich split-off," in which a 
company that owns a big stake in another company agrees to hand over the stake in exchange for cash and a 
small business. 
Mr Chernin said News hoped to use its controlling stake in DirecTV, the number one US satellite television 
operator, to launch one or two new cable networks each year. 
"We want to constantly start one or two new cable channels every year," Mr Chernin said. "We think we're good at 
it." 
News Corp ordinary shares fell 7 to $23.48. Its preferred shares also fell 7 to $22.36.

NEWS Corp has had informal talks but no formal negotiations with Liberty Media about buying back Liberty's 18

channels about 13.5 million subscribers. 
"We want to constantly start one or two new cable channels every year," Mr Chernin said. "We think we're good at

Fox News, which debuted in 17.5 million homes in October 1996, is now the top-rated cable news network, 
reaching about 85 million subscribers. 
Mr Chernin said the group was on track to introduce a new reality television channel in May or June.

Talk turns to Malone deals 
Companies and Markets 
Talk turns to Malone deals

Speculation about News's next move has been revived, writes Katrina Nicholas. 
Debate intensified yesterday over whether News Corp's move to buy out Fox Entertainment Group minority 
shareholders will spark more mop-up actions or bring the media conglomerate closer to a deal with shareholder 
Liberty Media's John Malone. 
Although most local equity analysts and fund managers agreed the $US5.8 billion ($7.7 billion) offer made 
strategic sense for News Corp and represented reasonable value for Fox minority shareholders, many were 
divided on the likelihood of subsequent deals. 
Buying out the minorities in Fox has reignited speculation News Corp may also bring UK pay TV operator BSkyB 
or DirecTV in-house. DirecTV is 34 per cent owned by Fox, which is 82 per cent owned by News Corp, while 
BSkyB is 35.33 per cent owned by a News Corp subsidiary. 
"It may be [a precursor] to something like that but it doesn't naturally follow," ABN Amro Asset Management 
portfolio manager Neil Boyd-Clark said. "BSkyB is separately listed in the UK and DirecTV is a subsidiary treated 
as an associate, which has its own issues." 
A fund manager who declined to be named said News Corp had equity interests in BSkyB and DirecTV for their 
distribution capabilities and had no need to own any more. 
However, Morgan Stanley has floated the possibility of a DirecTV or BSkyB buy-in, but for cash rather than 
limited-voting News Corp shares, the currency being used in the Fox transaction. News Corp's decision to use 
limited-voting stock to buy out Fox minority shareholders means existing News Corp shareholders with 
limited-voting stock will be diluted. 
Some market watchers yesterday argued News Corp could have used some cash, given its strong balance sheet. 
News raised $US1.75 billion in debt late last year and had $5.8 billion in cash at September 30. 
News Corp chief financial officer David DeVoe said no cash was used because "we think there's a very large 
benefit to the existing Fox shareholders to continue to have a stake in the Fox assets through News Corp by 
taking News Corp stock". 
"Secondly, the issue in stock-only allows us to do this transaction on a non-taxable basis," he said. 
Mr DeVoe said the deal had no relation to any potential negotiations with Liberty Media. 
"This transaction doesn't have any bearing on any other transaction. This transaction stands alone." 
Regardless, some equity analysts said it could bring a deal between News Corp's Rupert Murdoch and Mr 
Malone a step closer. 
Speculation as to Mr Malone's intentions increased last year after he used some of his non-voting News Corp 
stock to increase his voting stake in the group from 9.15 per cent to 18 per cent. Mr Murdoch subsequently 
implemented a stockholder rights plan, or poison pill, which makes it almost impossible for any party to acquire a 
large number of News shares without board approval.

"It's a long bow but it may mean a deal with Malone, like a cash-rich spin-off, is more likely. Maybe having 100 per 
cent control of Fox would make it easier for News Corp to spin off a Fox asset," one media analyst said. 
A cash-rich spin- or split-off would allow News to buy back some of Liberty Media's voting interest. It would 
involve News placing cash and a non-core asset in a separate company and trading that company for News 
shares held by Liberty. For Liberty, this would be a tax-effective way to relinquish its News holding.

SYDNEY: News Corp Inc s $US5.86 billion ($A7.74 billion) bid for the remainder of Fox Entertainment Group 
prompted speculation yesterday it could be linked to a resolution of a stand-off with John Malone s Liberty Media 
Corp. 
Rupert Murdoch s media company moved overnight to consolidate its complex global structure by offering to 
swap its own stock for the 17.9 per cent of Fox shares it does not already own. 
News Corp chief financial officer Dave DeVoe presented the deal as a tidy-up operation that gave the group 100 
per cent control of the lucrative film and television company that includes 20th Century Fox film studios among its 
assets. 
It s a logical step ... particularly since our reincorporation in the US and inclusion in the S&P500 has reduced the 
need to have a separate listing for Fox, Mr DeVoe told analysts via a conference call from the US. 
The Fox consolidation had been widely tipped after News Corp shifted its base from Adelaide to the US state of 
Delaware in November and listed on the US S&P500 index last month. 
However, most analysts expected News Corp s first big initiative as a US company would be to resolve a potential 
threat from Mr Malone s US cable group. 
Liberty Media snapped up 17 per cent of News Corp behind Mr Murdoch s back on November 4 last year, 
prompting News Corp to set up a poison pill provision to protect it from takeover. 
Goldman Sachs JB Were analysts said a lack of obvious financial imperative to do the Fox deal raised questions 
about why News Corp was buying out the minorities when Fox shares were trading close to a 12 month high. 
It s also likely to raise the question whether the transaction is being done to coincide with a selective buyback of 
Liberty Media s non-voting News Corp stake, the analysts said in a research note. 
However, Shaw Stockbroking head of research Scott Marshall said while Mr Murdoch needed to resolve the 
situation with Mr Malone, the Fox deal was not necessarily a part of that process. 
News Corp needs to resolve the Liberty situation one way or another, Mr Marshall said. 
But I don t think that resolving the Fox situation is a necessary precursor to resolving the Liberty situation. 
ABN Amro analyst Peter Shorthouse said he did not think the deals were directly linked.

SHARES in Rupert Murdoch's News Corp slid lower yesterday, as the market factored in dilution from its $7.74 
billion mop-up bid for the 18 per cent of Fox Entertainment Group it does not already own. 
However, the deal will not dilute the Murdoch family's 29.5 per cent interest in News Corp's voting stock. 
Nor will it dilute the 17 per cent held by media mogul John Malone. 
News Corp's ordinary shares closed down 19c at $23.78 yesterday after trading as low as $23.57, while the 
non-voting shares fell 34c to end the day at $22.62. 
However, analysts expect any price weakness over the deal to be relatively short-lived once investors consider 
the bigger picture. 
The exchange offer aims to eliminate duplicated corporate costs and solidify News Corp's control over Fox's 
assets, which include the Fox broadcast network which produces The Simpsons and 24. 
It also has Fox news and sports channels, the Fox movie studio and a controlling interest in satellite TV giant 
DirecTV. 
The widely anticipated deal follows News Corp's reincorporation in the United States and New York listing late 
last year. Fox was partially floated in 1998 as a means of gaining a US listing to attract American institutional 
investors, with mandates barring them from acquiring shares in foreign companies. 
But as News Corp's chief financial officer David DeVoe pointed out to analysts during a conference call yesterday, 
"the logic for Fox no longer exists". 
"We really took Fox public as a way to drive value into the stock," he said. 
Accompanying documentation points out the merger would eliminate "potential conflicts of interest". 
Although Wall St called the deal "fairly valued", not all Fox shareholders agreed. 
Law firm Faruqi & Faruqi filed a suit on behalf of a group of Fox shareholders charging News Corp with grossly 
undervaluing Fox.

NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - News Corp. (NWS.N) has had informal talks but no formal negotiations with 
Liberty Media Corp. (L.N) about buying back Liberty's 18 percent voting stake in Rupert Murdoch's media 
conglomerate, News Corp. said on Wednesday. 
News Corp. President Peter Chernin, speaking at an investor conference, said News Corp. would consider a

NEWS Corp is facing legal action over its bid to buy the remainder of Fox Entertainment Group. 
The company officially announced a $US5.8 billion ($A7.7 billion) bid for Fox in a statement to the New York 
Stock Exchange late on Monday night. 
News Corp offered 1.9 of its non-voting shares for each Fox share in an effort to take back full control of the 
company. 
But two US law firms launched class action suits within hours of the announcement, claiming the offer was 
inadequate. 
"The transaction is unconscionable and unfair and grossly inadequate because the intrinsic value of Fox 
Entertainment's common stock is materially in excess of the amount offered," lawyers Faruqui and Faruqui said 
in a statement. 
Rupert Murdoch's global media conglomerate already owns 82.1 per cent of Fox. 
It relinquished full ownership of the company in 1998 to allow US institutional investors who were forbidden from 
buying shares in foreign companies to invest in its US-controlled property. 
News Corp chief financial officer David DeVoe said the bid for full ownership of Fox was a logical step for the 
company. 
News Corp, which owns the Herald Sun, officially became a US company in November when it finalised its move 
from Australia. 
"Our reincorporation in the United States and inclusion in the S&P 500 has reduced the need to have a separate 
listing for Fox," Mr DeVoe told analysts and media in New York. 
"While we believe that there is much merit in completing this transaction, we also note that we obviously already 
control and operate Fox through our 82 per cent position and therefore the operational benefits of this transaction 
are limited." 
When it was announced, the News Corp offer represented a premium of 7.4 per cent to Fox's January 7 closing 
price. 
But the bid pushed Fox shares almost 10 per cent higher on the New York Stock Exchange, leaving the offer 
about 5 per cent below market value. 
News Corp shares fell in New York on the announcement, and closed 19 lower at $23.78 on the ASX yesterday. 
The non-voting shares fell 34 to $22.62. 
But Shaw Stockbroking research head Scott Marshall said the fall was likely to be temporary and the shares 
should recover. 
US analysts described the offer as "fairly valued", despite the fall in its worth in Monday's trading. 
Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen expected the bid to be News Corp's final offer.

Page 83 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The bid for Fox -- News Corp's first major announcement since its reincorporation -- again prompted speculation 
about US media mogul John Malone. 
The Fox buy-back will see News Corp's non-voting shares diluted, but Mr Malone's 17 per cent voting stake will 
not be affected. 
The head of Liberty Media quietly increased his interest in News Corp last year, prompting the company to invoke 
a "poison pill" takeover defence.

News Corp offers pounds 3bn to buy remaining stake in Fox 
News Corp offers pounds 3bn to buy remaining stake in Fox

LONDON - Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is attempting to buy out minority shareholders in Fox 
Entertainment Group to acquire the 18% of the company that it does not already own, in a deal worth dollars 
5.8bn (pounds 3.1bn). 
The deal was widely expected after the company moved from Australia to the US in October last year, when it 
shifted its primary stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange and was added to the Standard & Poor's 500 
index. 
The deal will go through if more than half the minority investors accept the offer, which will remain open until 
February 7. 
News Corp currently owns 82% of Fox, which houses the studios behind blockbuster films such as 'The Day After 
Tomorrow' and 'I, Robot'. With no major acquisitions in sight, the media giant is attempting to consolidate shares 
in companies that it already has a stake in. 
This could also include future offers for pay-TV broadcaster BSkyB, in which News Corp has a 35% stake, and 
US satellite broadcaster DirecTV, in which it holds a 34% stake. 
A deal with Liberty Media, which owns 18% of the voting shares in News Corp, could also be on the cards 
because the absence of minority shareholers could help facilitate such a deal.

SHARES in News Corporation's US media business Fox Entertainment Group soared 10 per cent yesterday 
after News revealed a $US5.86 billion ($7.7 billion) bid to buy out minority owners of the $US32 billion entity. 
If the bid succeeds, minority shareholders in Fox are expected to collectively hold about 10 per cent of News -- 
parent company of The Australian -- after it issues 332 million non-voting shares in exchange for the 17.9 per cent 
of Fox stock it does not own. 
The deal, which is the first major announcement from News since it shifted its main stock market listing to Wall 
Street late last year, will increase the number of News's non-voting shares on issue by 17 per cent. 
The rise in Fox's share price to levels not seen since the dotcom boom of 2000 was fuelled by investors hoping 
News would sweeten its offer. 
Shares lifted $US3.06 to $US34.28 on hopes News -- owner of Fox television stations in the US and the 
venerable 20th Century Fox movie studio -- might have to pay more to convince minority shareholders to sell out. 
But in a conference call with investors, News finance chief David DeVoe played down the likelihood of a higher 
offer, saying the bid represented a "full and fair price". 
"First of all, Fox is trading at a 52-week high (and) if you look at the premium we're offering it's 7.4 per cent above 
the close on Friday," he said. 
"But if you look at it over the past three months it's an 11.5 per cent premium, over six months it's 16.5 per cent 
and over 12 months it's an 18 per cent premium." 
Mr DeVoe argued the move was a logical step for News as its recent shift to the US and inclusion in Wall Street's 
influential S&P 500 index reduced the need for a separate US listing for Fox. 
"Since the re-incorporation of News into the US the logic for Fox really no longer exists," he said. 
"We initially took Fox public as a way to drive value into News's stock because we were a foreign company, or an 
Australian company, and there were many shareholders who couldn't own us. With our re-incorporation that logic 
and (those) reasons are really gone." 
The deal's success is expected to hinge on its acceptance by Fox's three major institutional shareholders -- 
Barclays, Fidelity and Capital Research. 
News can move to compulsory acquisition once it gains acceptances from 90 per cent of minority shareholders, 
but that is expected to be aided by a clause that states it can swap its non-voting Fox shares for voting shares 
once it wins acceptance from more than half of minority owners. 
The issue of a mass of new non-voting shares -- the stock included in the S&P 500 -- is expected to increase 
News's weighting in the index, which is tracked by most US institutional investors.

But the dilution of existing owners of the non-voting shares prompted those shares to fall 34c to $22.63 in local 
trade yesterday. News's voting stock also fell but by a smaller margin, finishing 19c lower at $23.78. 
Media analysts said the move was largely immaterial to News's profitability as it already controlled Fox's cash 
flow with its 81.1 per cent stake. 
Goldman Sachs JB Were said the effect on earnings per share in 2005 would be less than 1 per cent, while ABN 
AMRO said any deal to mop up Fox below $US36 a share would boost EPS.

NEW YORK -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., moving to regain full control of its majority-owned Fox television 
properties, is offering to buy the remaining publicly held shares of Fox Entertainment Group Inc. in a $5.9 billion 
stock deal. 
The exchange offer announced yesterday would solidify Murdoch's control over the Fox assets, which include the 
Fox broadcast network as well as Fox news and sports channels, the Twentieth Century Fox movie studio, and a 
controlling interest in satellite television giant DirecTV. 
The move had been expected after the November decision by News Corp., which also owns newspaper, book 
publishing, television and satellite TV assets around the world, to move its base to the United States from 
Australia. 
At the time, News Corp. said the relocation would help expand the company's base of shareholders, because 
some institutional shareholders were limited in how much stock they could own in foreign-listed companies. 
Analysts also said it would make it easier for News Corp. to make U.S. acquisitions; previously, News Corp. had 
to rely on Fox stock for leverage in dealmaking. 
Under the deal announced yesterday, News Corp. would offer to exchange 1.9 shares of News Corp. stock for 
each outstanding Fox Class A share that it doesn't already own. 
News Corp. currently owns about 82.1 percent of the equity and 97.0 percent of the voting power of Fox 
Entertainment. 
It owns about 59.1 percent of the outstanding Fox Class A common stock and all of the Fox Class B common 
stock. 
Based on Friday's closing prices, the company said the exchange offer represented a premium of about 7.4 
percent for the Fox Class A shares. 
There are about 175 million Fox Class A shares that are not held by News Corp. Fox Class A shares closed at 
$31.22 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, valuing the Fox shares News Corp. doesn't own at $5.46 
billion. 
A 7.4 percent premium would value those shares at about $33.53 each for a total of nearly $5.9 billion. 
Yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, News Corp. shares slipped 38 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $17.85. Fox 
Entertainment shares rose $3.06, or 9.8 percent, to $34.28 - positioning the stock for a new 52-week high. 
News Corp. also expects that the Fox board will form a special committee of Fox directors who are not directors 
or executive officers of News Corp. to consider the proposal and make a recommendation to Fox shareholders 
regarding the deal.

News Corp. Makes Offer to Purchase The Rest of Fox

News Corp. Makes Offer to Purchase The Rest of Fox

NEW YORK -- News Corp. unveiled a long-awaited offer to exchange about $5.7 billion (4.4 billion euros) of its 
shares for the stock it doesn't already own in Fox Entertainment Group Inc., but the media giant immediately 
came under pressure to raise the offer price. 
Shares of Fox, of which News Corp. owns 82%, were up nearly 10% at $34.28 yesterday in 4 p.m. New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading, taking them above the value of the offer. Still, News Corp. Chief Financial 
Officer David DeVoe told analysts that News Corp. was offering a "full and fair price." 
Fox Entertainment houses the Fox broadcast network and television-station group, cable channels such as Fox 
News Channel and the 20th Century Fox film studio. Expectations had risen in the past few months that News 
Corp. would make the offer, fueled by comments from News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch in October that an 
offer would be considered. 
News Corp. sold to the public a minority stake in Fox in late 1998 to make it easier for U.S. investors to invest in 
News Corp.-controlled assets. Until recently, News Corp. was domiciled in Australia, which restricted the number 
of U.S. investors who could buy its stock. But it moved its domicile to Delaware in November. The domicile shift 
meant the logic of having Fox as a separate stock "no longer exists," Mr. DeVoe said. 
News Corp. is offering 1.9 of its nonvoting Class A shares for every Fox share. At Friday's close, that ratio valued 
Fox shares at $33.54, compared with Fox's close of $31.22. But in the wake of the offer, News Corp. Class A 
shares dropped 52 cents to $17.13 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, reducing the value of 
the offer to $32.55, while Fox shares rose. 
Some on Wall Street said News Corp.'s offer wasn't high enough. Prudential Equity Group analyst Katherine 
Styponias argued in a report that a fair price would be $37, valuing Fox in line with the market values of Fox's 
rivals. Prudential cut its rating on Fox to "neutral" in light of the offer. But Richard Greenfield, an analyst with 
Fulcrum Global Partners, argued that News Corp. was offering a fair price, noting that News Corp. stock was itself 
undervalued. Fulcrum has a "buy" rating on News Corp.'s Class A shares and a neutral on Fox. 
News Corp. said the offer was a premium of 16.9% to Fox's average price over the past six months. Fox shares 
have risen sharply during recent months, from about $25 each in the summer. News Corp. said it expected Fox's 
board to form a special committee of independent directors to consider the proposal. 
Perhaps anticipating pressure from minority shareholders for a higher price, Mr. DeVoe played down the 
significance of the offer for News Corp. "There are no strategic benefits at all," he told analysts, saying it would 
help simplify the company's capital structure. News Corp. would save some money on "public-company 
expenses," he said. 
He denied that the timing of the offer is related to News Corp.'s discussions with Liberty Media Corp. about a 
buyback of Liberty stock in News Corp. "This transaction doesn't have any bearing on any other transaction," Mr. 
DeVoe said. 
Full ownership of Fox could make it easier for News Corp. to offer Fox assets in a buyback. News Corp. and 
Liberty are expected to negotiate a buyback in coming months under which News Corp. would trade an asset and 
a large amount of cash for a big chunk of Liberty's $9 billion stake in News Corp. Liberty's stake includes an 18% 
voting stake in News Corp. as well as a large number of nonvoting shares.

RUPERT Murdoch's News Corp Inc is poised to announce a $US7 billion ($9.27 billion) bid to buy the rest of Fox 
Entertainment Group Inc, according to media reports. 
The New York Times reported yesterday that Mr Murdoch was moving to beef up his empire in the US by having 
News Corp buy out the 17.9 per cent of Fox it does not own for about $US7 billion. 
The Wall Street Journal online said Mr Murdoch was expected to announce the deal in the next few days. 
News Corp was unavailable for comment. 
The New York Times said the transaction was approved overnight by News Corp's board and would "solidify 
Murdoch's control over some of the nation's most valuable media assets such as the Fox broadcast network and 
the DirecTV satellite service". 
An Australian analyst said the deal might weaken Mr Murdoch's ability to fight off any move by US billionaire John 
Malone to increase his stake.

News Corp is close to buying out all the minor interests in its Fox Entertainment Group at a cost of up to $US7 
billion ($9.24 billion), its first major deal since switching bases from Australia to the United States. 
Though the company's New York spokesman would not confirm the deal late last night (Australian time), analysts 
were confident that News planned to privatise Fox - which has been listed for only six years - with details of a 
share offer for the 17.9 per cent of Fox in public hands to be released within days. 
The New York Times reported that the board of News Corp agreed to the purchase on Sunday night. 
The deal - which executive chairman Rupert Murdoch foreshadowed at the annual meeting in Adelaide last 
November - will give News full control over some of America's most valuable media assets, such as the Fox 
Broadcast Network, the DirecTV satellite and 20th Century Fox film studios, and help simplify the global media 
group's complex structure. 
"It makes absolute sense to take out Fox just to clean up the structure," UBS media analyst Tony Wilson said. 
"That's where a lot of the growth in the share price is going to come from. 
"And it makes sense to do it sooner rather than later because we think Fox has a very good 12 months ahead of 
it, in which case the price for it will rise." 
News raised about $US2.8 billion in 1998 by selling the minority stake in Fox, which has since issued further 
shares for its acquisition of DirecTV, contributing to the increased cost of privatising the business. 
Based on its closing price of $US31.22 on Wall Street last Friday, the final 17.9 per cent of the Fox group is 
capitalised at $US5.44 billion. Analysts expected minority shareholders to haggle for a premium for their shares in 
a company which last year boosted operating income by nearly 28 per cent to $US2.3 billion. 
News is expected to issue more limited-voting stock to fund the deal. 
"I think there will be a little bit of earnings-per-share accretion for News if they can do it for less than $US35 per 
share," Mr Wilson said. 
While Wall Street pundits hailed the move to make News Corp a "more shareholder-friendly US company", some 
argued that Mr Murdoch should be trying to seek a peace agreement with rival baron John Malone before going 
after Fox. 
In November, Mr Malone's Liberty Media stunned the Murdoch camp by agreeing to buy a big parcel of News 
Corp voting shares from institutional bank Merrill Lynch. The deal with Merrill, made possible by the large amount 
of loose News Corp stock as Australian investors exited the register, effectively brought Liberty up to 17 per cent 
control of News Corp, second only to the Murdochs themselves, who have about 30 per cent. 
Only a week later, News introduced a poison pill provision to thwart all would-be predators and keep the 
Murdochs in control of the company. 
"The timing is confusing because we had expected Mr Murdoch to complete a transaction with Mr Malone before 
buying in Fox," said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners. He said he thought News

Corp shares would have jumped higher after buying out of Malone and thus fewer News shares would be needed 
to buy out the Fox minorities.

Buyout Shows Murdoch In No Hurry Over Liberty

Buyout Shows Murdoch In No Hurry Over Liberty

Rupert Murdoch's announcement yesterday that his News Corporation would take full control of the Fox 
Entertainment Group sent a signal that he does not feel pressured to resolve his dispute with John C. Malone's 
Liberty Media Corporation before pushing ahead with other deals. 
Many analysts and investors had expected that Mr. Murdoch would settle the conflict over Liberty's voting interest 
in the News Corporation before buying out Fox. But Mr. Murdoch went ahead yesterday and said that he would 
buy the 18 percent of Fox that his company did not own, in a deal worth about $6 billion. 
Although the Fox deal has long been expected, it may not necessarily go smoothly. The News Corporation is 
offering 1.9 shares of its stock for each share of Fox. News Corporation shares closed down 52 cents yesterday 
at $17.13 a share, and Fox shares rose $3.06 a share to close at $34.28. That puts the value of the Fox shares at 
more than 1.9 times the value of the News Corporation shares. 
The pricing indicates that investors think that the News Corporation will have to sweeten its offer, the way Cox 
Enterprises did last year when it bought out the public's minority stake in its cable business. 
The News Corporation requires only a recommendation from a board committee to go ahead at the current price, 
which is a 7.4 percent premium over the price on Friday. But if most minority shareholders oppose the offer, the 
company will have to raise its bid. 
Richard Greenfield, who follows the News Corporation for Fulcrum Global Partners, said the Fox purchase is 
different from the Cox deal because the Fox deal is a stock offer, not a cash offer; investors would pay no taxes 
on the deal and could participate in the company's future. 
Once the Fox deal is complete, the News Corporation will still have the financial muscle to make virtually any 
acquisition it may desire. It has debt of $5 billion and it had cash flow of about $3 billion in 2004. 
After the Fox deal, most investors expect the News Corporation to focus on expanding its stable of cable 
channels to bolster the appeal of DirecTV, the satellite TV service in which it has 36 percent ownership. Its priority 
now is creating programming for DirecTV. 
''It's a land grab,'' Andrew Baker, who follows the News Corporation for Cathay Financial, said of the Fox deal. 
''There is a limited universe of subscribers. You grab them today and make it profitable tomorrow. DirecTV is 
spending a fortune to get more subscribers as a basis for launching new channels. They have already said they 
will launch a reality channel and maybe a business news channel.'' 
The latest Fox deal effectively has little impact on any arrangement with Liberty and Mr. Malone; it is merely a 
plan to simplify the structure of the News Corporation. 
Talks between Liberty and the News Corporation have gone nowhere and the News Corporation seems to feel 
that it is under less pressure to resolve the dispute than Liberty does. Representatives of Liberty did not return 
phone messages yesterday. 
Last year, Liberty increased its voting interest in the News Corporation to 17 percent from 9 percent. Mr. 
Murdoch, whose family controls 30 percent of the votes, was reportedly angry about the purchase. The News

Page 96 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Corporation has since put in place a provision that precludes Mr. Malone from controlling more than 18 percent of 
the votes. 
One strategy the two sides have discussed to resolve their differences is a ''cash-rich split'' in which Liberty would 
swap some News Corporation shares for cash and a small asset. The News Corporation could buy the shares at 
a discount because the deal would be tax-free to Liberty. 
In early December, the News Corporation's chief financial officer, David F. DeVoe, and a senior adviser, Arthur 
Siskind, went to Denver with Mr. Malone, who is Liberty's chairman, and its president, Robert R. Bennett, to 
discuss a possible asset swap. 
Gary L. Ginsberg, a News Corporation spokesman, said Mr. Murdoch never intended to go to the meeting. 
To some, Mr. Murdoch's decision to send top lieutenants to meet with Liberty rather than go himself was a signal 
that he was not in a hurry to resolve the dispute. 
One former media executive who requested anonymity saw Mr. Murdoch's absence from the meeting as a sign 
that he was still displeased with Mr. Malone for buying voting shares of the News Corporation without telling Mr. 
Murdoch. Mr. Ginsberg denied that this was the case. 
Neither side needs to cut a deal immediately, but it has been speculated that Mr. Malone would eventually hope 
to liquidate Liberty. Converting the News Corporation shares to cash would make that strategy easier.

News Corporation, the media and entertainment group led by Mr Rupert Murdoch, is set to acquire full control of 
Fox Entertainment, its US TV and studio affiliate, in an all-share deal worth $5.86 billion (4.48 billion). 
News Corp, which already controls 82.1 per cent of Fox's equity and 97 per cent of its voting shares, is offering 
stock to Fox shareholders to consolidate its US media holdings in the US. 
Mr Murdoch, who mooted a buyout last autumn, won board approval for the deal at the weekend. It follows the 
company's reincorporation in the US and a shift of its main stock market listing from Sydney to New York. 
Fox's assets include Fox News, the controversial cable news channel, the Twentieth Century Fox studio and a 34 
per cent controlling stake in DirecTV, the largest US satellite TV platform. 
Under the deal, holders of Fox class A common stock will get shares in News Corp on a 1.9-for-1 ratio - equal to 
$33.54 a share. Mr Dave DeVoe, News Corp chief financial officer, said the offer represented a premium of about 
7.4 per cent to Fox's closing price on January 7th, and 16.9 per cent to the average trading price over the last six 
months. "It will be a significant milestone in the simplification of News Corp's capital structure. It's a full and fair 
price." 
The offer will be considered by Fox directors - not linked to News Corp - who are likely to form a special 
committee to make a recommendation to minority shareholders. 
The all-paper deal would leave Mr Murdoch with cash reserves at News Corp to fund a possible buy-back of 
voting shares acquired by Liberty Media, the media investment company led by Mr John Malone. 
He surprised News Corp last November by taking an option to increase his voting stake in the company to 18 per 
cent, second to the Murdoch 29 per cent holding.

Murdoch to buy out shareholders in Fox

Rupert Murdoch, consolidating his global media empire in the United States, will buy out the shareholders of his 
Fox properties for about $6 billion, executives of his company, News Corp., announced Monday. 
The deal would solidify Murdoch's control over some of America's most valuable media assets like the Fox 
broadcast network and the DirecTV satellite service and help simplify the complicated structure of News Corp., 
whose far-flung operations include newspapers, television, movie and satellite assets around the globe. 
It also puts Murdoch in a better position to leverage his full ownership of the Fox Entertainment Group for future 
deals. 
News Corp. executives announced that holders of Fox Class A stock would receive 1.9 Class A News Corp. 
shares for every share exchanged. The company's chief financial officer, David DeVoe, valued the offer at $33.54 
a 7.4 percent premium over Friday's closing price of Fox shares, which was $31.22 
Fox shares jumped $3.06, or 9.8 percent, on Monday to close at $34.28 in New York. The share price was above 
the value of the deal, indicating that investors might expect an improved offer in the future. News Corp.'s Class A 
shares fell 52 cents, or 2.9 percent, to close at $17.13. 
The transaction, which the board of News Corp. approved Sunday night, would also make Murdoch's company an 
even more formidable media power in the United States. Murdoch, who gave up his Australian citizenship 19 
years ago to become a U.S. citizen, recently reincorporated News Corp. in the United States and shifted its 
primary stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange from the Australian exchange. 
"The move underscores the simplification process: Murdoch's drive to make News Corp. a simpler and more 
shareholder-friendly U.S. company," said Mario Gabelli, chief investment officer of Gabelli Asset Management, 
whose fund owns shares of both News Corp. and Fox Entertainment. 
During a conference call with stock analysts Monday, DeVoe cited that desire for consolidation as the prime 
motive behind the announcement, which he called "a milestone in the simplification of the News Corp.'s capital 
structure." He said the decision to spin Fox Entertainment off as a separate stock had been a way to tap into the 
U.S. investment market while News Corp. was incorporated outside the United States. Now that News Corp. itself 
was listed in New York, that logic no longer applied, he said. 
DeVoe said the consolidation would also allow for about $3 million to $7 million in savings from reducing 
expenses associated with the filings required for public companies. 
The move to bring Fox Entertainment back inside the fold of News Corp. also gives Murdoch more flexibility to 
wield his deal-making muscle in the United States, where he used to have to rely on the often faltering stock price 
of his Fox subsidiary as leverage for deals. 
"This makes it easier for News Corp. to do deals," said Harold Vogel, an entertainment analyst. "It simplifies the 
structure and gives it full control over the deal making process." 
The timing of the transaction raises questions about the status of Murdoch's feud with John Malone, chairman of 
Liberty Media, who raised his company's holdings in News Corp. to 17 percent in November behind the back of 
Murdoch, who owns a 30 percent voting stake.

Only a week later, News Corp. introduced a plan to thwart would- be hostile bidders and keep Murdoch in control 
of the company, which he plans to turn over to his sons: Lachlan, now deputy chief operating officer, and James, 
chief executive of British Sky Broadcasting, Murdoch's satellite TV company in Britain. 
"The timing is confusing because we had expected Murdoch to complete a transaction with Malone before buying 
in Fox," said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners. 
DeVoe denied on Monday that the move was related to any possible deal with Liberty. 
Several analysts questioned the price offered to Fox shareholders, which they said appeared low. DeVoe 
defended the price, saying that the closing price on Friday represented the stock's 52-week high. The News Corp. 
offer represents a 16.9 percent premium in comparison to Fox's six-month average, he said.

NEW YORK 
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., moving to regain full control of its majority owned Fox television properties, is 
offering to buy the remaining publicly held shares of Fox Entertainment Group Inc. in a $5.9 billion US stock 
deal. 
The exchange offer announced yesterday would solidify Murdoch's control over the Fox assets which include the 
Fox broadcast network as well as Fox news and sports channels, the 20th Century Fox movie studio and a 
controlling interest in satellite television giant DirecTV. 
The move had been expected following the November decision by News Corp., which also owns newspaper, 
book publishing, television and satellite TV assets around the world, to move its base to the United States from 
Australia. 
"Given the News reincorportation in the U.S., we saw little reason for Fox to continue as a separate carved out 
entity and as such believed that the takeout was likely," Prudential Equity Group Inc. analyst Katherine Styponias 
said in a research note. 
Under the deal announced yesterday, News Corp. would offer to exchange 1.9 shares of News Corp. stock for 
each outstanding Fox Class A share that it doesn't already own. 
News Corp. currently owns about 82.1 per cent of the equity and 97 per cent of the voting power of Fox 
Entertainment. 
It owns about 59.1 per cent of the outstanding Fox Class A common stock and all of the Fox Class B common 
stock. 
Based on Friday's closing prices, the company said the exchange offer represented a premium of about 7.4 per 
cent for the Fox Class A shares. 
There are about 175 million Fox Class A shares that are not held by News Corp. Fox Class A shares closed at 
$31.22 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, valuing the Fox shares News Corp. doesn't own at $5.46 
billion. 
A 7.4 per cent premium would value those shares at about $33.53 each for a total of nearly $5.9 billion. 
Analysts were mixed whether the News Corp. offer was adequate. 
"We disagree ... that the offer constitutes a fair and full price," Styponias, the Prudential analyst, said in her report. 
"A price closer to $37 is what they should hold out for." 
Styponias also downgraded Fox shares from overweight to neutral, citing the limited upside because of the News 
Corp. offer. 
In another research report, Oppenheimer & Co. said News Corp.'S offer "may seem small, but the transaction is 
not a necessity for NWS, and changes virtually nothing operationally. We see little likelihood for NWS increasing 
its offer."

News Corp. also expects that the Fox board will form a special committee of Fox directors who are not directors 
or executive officers of News Corp. to consider the proposal and make a recommendation to Fox shareholders 
regarding the deal.

Murdoch to buy out Fox shareholders

Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is planning to buy out minority shareholders in the Fox Entertainment 
Group in a pounds 3bn deal. 
News Corp said it intended to buy the 18% of Fox - home to 20th Century Fox film studios and the Fox news 
channel - it did not own by getting investors to swap their Fox shares for News Corp stock. 
If a deal is agreed, it would strengthen Mr Murdoch's grip on one of his most important assets, allowing him 
greater power in striking deals with other broadcasters. 
News Corp now owns 82.1% of Fox's equity and 97% of its voting rights through its ownership of 59.1% of the 
company's class A stock. It is offering the other 40.9% of class A investors 1.9 News Corp shares for each Fox 
share - a deal that represents a 7.4% premium on last week's share price. 
The proposal comes only a few weeks after News Corp moved its primary stock market listing to the US in a shift 
away from its roots as a newspaper publisher in Australia. News Corp now generates more than three-quarters of 
its earnings in the US. 
Mr Murdoch bought 20th Century Fox in 1985, at the same time as the Metromedia stable of city TV stations, 
which he turned into America's de facto fourth national television network, Fox TV. He soon made headlines with 
sensational shows such as America's Most Wanted, a weekly crime documentary, and similar "true lives" style 
shows. 
To comply with rules that only US nationals could control more than 25% of TV assets, the Australian mogul took 
American citizenship. 
In recent years Fox has become one of the leading television networks in the US, challenging the traditional 
supremacy of ABC, CBS and NBC. The Fox News channel has courted controversy, with ac cusations that it is a 
biased mouthpiece for President Bush and the Republican party. 
Fox had total revenues of about $12bn (pounds 6.5bn) last year, with News Corp's share of that accounting for 
nearly half of the parent company's turnover. 
Mr Murdoch's decision to take over all of Fox follows last year's move to acquire the 20% of the Italian satellite 
broadcaster Sky Italia not already owned by News Corp. His media empire also includes a number of properties 
that are not wholly owned, such as the US satellite business DirecTV and the UK satellite broadcaster BSkyB, in 
which News Corp has a 35.4% stake.

New York NY 
Australian-born media baron Rupert Murdoch moved yesterday to consolidate his vast and diverse holdings 
through an offer, valued at $5.86-billion (U.S.), from his News Corp. to buy out minority shareholders in Fox 
Entertainment Group Inc., a bid that represents the final step in the Americanization of his empire. 
News Corp. offered yesterday to buy the 18 per cent of Fox shares that it does not own in exchange for its own 
shares. The deal was widely expected after the company switched its incorporation to Delaware from Australia in 
November, shifted its primary stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange and was added to the Standard & 
Poor's 500 index. 
At the same time, the planned merger of the Fox assets into the broader News Corp. family gives current Fox 
shareholders a more diverse media play, and affords Mr. Murdoch more flexibility in dealing with rival Liberty 
Media Corp., which has taken a sizable minority position in News Corp. 
Last fall, the News Corp. board adopted a poison pill to prevent Liberty chairman John Malone from achieving a 
creeping takeover of the company. Mr. Murdoch controls 30 per cent of the voting shares of News Corp., while 
Mr. Malone controls 18 per cent. 
Analysts have speculated that Mr. Murdoch could use the Fox assets in a deal to buy out Mr. Malone's interest 
and said yesterday that the absence of minority shareholders could help facilitate such a deal. 
However, News Corp. chief financial officer David DeVoe told a conference call yesterday that the company's 
offer was a stand-alone deal, unrelated to any other issue. 
This transaction doesn't have any bearing on any other transaction, Mr. DeVoe said. 
He added that the buyout was a logical step given News Corp.'s move from being an Australian domiciled 
company to an American one. Mr. DeVoe said there were no strategic or operational gains from the deal because 
News Corp. already controls Fox Entertainment. (Mr. Murdoch is chairman and chief executive officer of both 
companies.) Analysts agreed. 
News Corp. issued shares in Fox Entertainment in 1998 to facilitate purchases by U.S. investors who were 
unable to buy the Australia stock. Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co., said the separate 
share structure no longer made sense, given the change in News Corp.'s domicile. 
Fox served its purpose, which is no longer necessary, Ms. Cohen said in a report. A Fox buy-in simplifies the 
News Corp. story. 
Mr. Murdoch was among the first to benefit in the 1990s from deregulation that encouraged media convergence 
by allowing companies to own both television stations and newspapers in the same city. 
The share swap was valued at $33.54 (U.S.) a Fox share at Friday's close, a 7-per-cent premium that evaporated 
yesterday as investors drove Fox shares up on the New York Stock Exchange by nearly 10 per cent to $34.28. 
News Corp. shares were off 38 cents to $17.85.

Page 105 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Mr. DeVoe defended the slim premium, saying the price represented a 17-per-cent premium over Fox's average 
share price for the past six months. 
We believe it is full and fair value for Fox shareholders, Mr. DeVoe said in rejecting analysts' suggestions News 
Corp. may have to sweeten the offer. 
He also warned that News Corp. was not prepared to raise the price in order to conclude the deal, which needs to 
approval of the majority of minority shareholders. 
News Corp. already accounts for its share of Fox Entertainment's growing profits, but would benefit from 100 per 
cent of those profits under the new structure. 
The growing Fox empire 
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. will secure control of Fox Entertainment Group if it succeeds in a $5.86-billion 
(U.S.) offer to buy out minority shareholders. A look at Fox's holdings (figures in U.S. dollars):

News Corporation today announced a $7.76 billion, all-stock offer to buy out other shareholders in Fox 
Entertainment Group and gain full ownership. 
The media group's chairman and chief executive, Rupert Murdoch, informed the Fox subsidiary's board in a 
letter today, saying the offer would be made to shareholders later in the day. 
News Corp, which publishes mX, owns about 82.1 per cent of the equity and 97 per cent of the voting power of 
Fox, which controls Fox Television Network, Fox cable channels and the Twentieth Century Fox movie studio. 
Under the deal, owners of the Fox Class A shares would get 1.9 News Corp shares for each Fox Class A share. 
The news sent News Corp shares down US30c, or 1.76 per cent, to $US17.91 by early afternoon, but Fox shares 
soared $US2.88, or 9.22 per cent, to $US34.10. 
News said the offer would only stand if it managed to get most of the stock it does not own. 
If successful, News Corp would end up with at least 90 per cent of the equity "and will complete promptly a 
short-form merger", it said. 
News Corp, which re-incorporated in Delaware last year, moving from its birthplace in Adelaide, said it expected 
Fox to set up a committee of directors who were not members of News Corp to consider the bid. 
"While Delaware law does not require that News Corp negotiate with the Fox board or reach any agreement with 
the Fox board concerning the offer, News Corp would, nonetheless, be happy to meet with the special committee 
to answer any questions it may have," Murdoch wrote in his letter to the Fox board. 
"News Corp's proposal, however, is not conditioned upon the special committee recommending or approving the 
offer," 
he said.

WSJ(1/11) News Corp. Offers $5.7 Billion To Buy Rest Of Fox 
(From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) 
By Martin Peers 
NEW YORK -- News Corp. unveiled a long-awaited offer to exchange about $5.7 billion of its shares for the stock 
it doesn't already own in Fox Entertainment Group Inc., but the media giant immediately came under pressure to 
raise the offer price. 
Shares of Fox, of which News Corp. owns 82%, were up nearly 10% at $34.28 each in 4 p.m. composite trading 
yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, rising above the value of the offer. Still, News Corp. Chief Financial 
Officer David DeVoe told analysts that News Corp. was making a 'full and fair' offer. 
Fox Entertainment houses the Fox broadcast network and television-station group, cable channels such as Fox 
News Channel and the 20th Century Fox film studio. Expectations had risen in the past few months that News 
Corp. would make the offer, fueled by comments from News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch in October that an 
offer would be considered. 
News Corp. sold to the public a minority stake in Fox in late 1998 to make it easier for U.S. investors to invest in 
News Corp.-controlled assets. Until recently, News Corp. was domiciled in Australia, which restricted the number 
of U.S. investors who could buy its stock. But it moved its domicile to Delaware in November. The domicile shift 
meant the logic of having Fox as a separate stock 'no longer exists,' Mr. DeVoe said. 
News Corp. is offering 1.9 of its nonvoting Class A shares for every Fox share. At Friday's close, that ratio valued 
Fox shares at $33.54, compared with Fox's close of $31.22. But News Corp. Class A shares dropped 52 cents to 
$17.13 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the Big Board yesterday, reducing the value of the offer to $32.55, while 
Fox shares rose. 
Some on Wall Street said News Corp.'s offer wasn't high enough. Prudential Equity Group analyst Katherine 
Styponias argued in a report that a fair price would be $37, valuing Fox in line with the market values of Fox's 
rivals. Prudential cut its rating on Fox to 'neutral' in light of the offer. But Richard Greenfield, an analyst with 
Fulcrum Global Partners, argued that News Corp. was offering a fair price, noting that News Corp. stock was itself 
undervalued. Fulcrum has a 'buy' rating on News Corp.'s Class A shares and a neutral on Fox. 
News Corp. said the offer was a premium of 16.9% to Fox's average price over the past six months. Fox shares 
have risen sharply during recent months, from about $25 each in the summer. News Corp. said it expected Fox's 
board to form a special committee of independent directors to consider the proposal. 
Perhaps anticipating pressure from minority shareholders for a higher price, Mr. DeVoe played down the 
significance of the offer for News Corp. 'There are no strategic benefits at all,' he told analysts, saying it would 
help simplify the company's capital structure. News Corp. would save some money on 'public-company 
expenses,' he said. 
He denied that the timing of the offer is related to News Corp.'s discussions with Liberty Media Corp. about a 
buyback of News Corp. stock that Liberty owns. 'This transaction doesn't have any bearing on any other 
transaction,' Mr. DeVoe said. 
Full ownership of Fox could make it easier for News Corp. to offer Fox assets in a buyback. News Corp. and 
Liberty are expected to negotiate a buyback in coming months under which News Corp. would trade an asset and

a large amount of cash for a big chunk of Liberty's $9 billion stake in News Corp. Liberty's stake includes an 18% 
voting stake in News Corp. as well as a large number of nonvoting shares.

Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said Monday it would take full control of its Fox Entertainment Group Inc. unit in 
a stock swap worth about $6 billion US, which it said would simplify the media conglomerate's structure. 
The deal, which sent Fox shares up 10 per cent, gives News Corp. full ownership of its U.S. entertainment assets 
such as 20th Century-Fox film studios, Fox Network, Fox News Channel and its stake in satellite broadcaster 
DirecTV, which could make it easier for Murdoch to pursue acquisitions.

RUPERT Murdoch's News Corp Inc is poised to announce a $US7 billion bid to buy the rest of Fox 
Entertainment Group Inc, media reports say. 
The New York Times reported yesterday Mr Murdoch was moving to beef up his empire in the US by having 
News Corp buy out the 17.9 per cent of Fox it does not own for about $US7 billion ($A9.27 billion). 
The Wall Street Journal online said Mr Murdoch was expected to announce the deal in the next few days. 
News Corp was unavalable for comment. 
The New York Times said the transaction was approved overnight by News Corp's board and would "solidify 
Murdoch's control over some of the nation's most valuable media assets such as the Fox broadcast network and 
the DirecTV satellite service". 
It was a consolidation move, said Mario Gabelli, chief investment officer of Gabelli Asset Management, whose 
fund owns shares of both News Corp and Fox Entertainment, according to the news report. 
"The move underscores the simplification process: Mr Murdoch's drive to make News Corp a simpler and more 
shareholder-friendly US company," Mr Gabelli told the New York Times. 
An Australian analyst, who did not wish to be named, said the deal might weaken Mr Murdoch's ability to fight off 
any move by US billionaire John Malone to increase his stake. 
After Mr Malone's Liberty Media took 17 per cent of News Corp last year, News invoked a poison pill to protect 
the company from takeover. 
Mr Murdoch has built the global group from just one Adelaide newspaper.

NEW YORK (AP) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., moving to regain full control of its Fox television properties, is 
offering to buy the remaining publicly held shares of Fox Entertainment Group for about $5.9 billion in stock. 
The offer announced Monday would solidify Murdoch's control over the Fox assets, which include the Fox 
broadcast network as well as Fox news and sports cable channels, the 20th Century Fox movie studio and a 
controlling interest in satellite television giant DirecTV. 
News Corp., which recently moved its base to the United States from Australia, also owns newspaper, book 
publishing, television and satellite TV assets around the world. 
Under the deal announced Monday, News Corp. is offering to exchange 1.9 shares of News Corp. stock for each 
outstanding Fox Class A share that it doesn't already own. 
Based on Friday's closing prices, the company said the exchange offer represented a premium of approximately 
7.4 percent for the Fox Class A shares, which closed at $31.22 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
News Corp. already owns 59.1 percent of the outstanding Fox Class A common stock and all of Fox Class B 
stock. 
The company said it plans to file details of the offer with the Securities and Exchange Commission and begin its 
exchange offer Monday.

FOCUS - News Corp. Fox offer may raise talk of deal with Liberty Media SYDNEY (XFN-ASIA)- News Corp.'s 
announcement of a 5.86 bln usd offer to take full control of its Fox Entertainment Group has raised prospects 
the media firm is positioning itself for a deal with John Malone's Liberty Media group, analysts said. News Corp.'s 
US-based chairman and chief executive, Rupert Murdoch, announced in New York yesterday that the firm has 
bid for the 17.9 pct of Fox it does not already own, offering 1.9 of its non-voting shares for each Fox share. The 
offer, based on Friday's closing price for News Corp. shares, had been anticipated since the formerly 
Adelaide-based News Corp. 
reincorporated in the US state of Delaware in late 2004. Fox Entertainment Group controls the Fox Television 
Network, Fox cable channels and the Twentieth Century Fox movie studio. "This is a logical step for our 
company, particularly since our reincorporation in the United States and inclusion in the SP 500 (index) has 
reduced the need to have a separate listing for Fox," News Corp. chief financial officer Dave DeVoe told analysts 
and media on a conference call. He said the operational benefits of the transaction were limited but it would 
represent "a significant milestone" in the simplification of the company's structure. Some analysts said it also 
raised questions about whether the bid was a precursor to a move by News Corp. to resolve its standoff with John 
Malone's US cable group Liberty Media which increased its stake in News Corp. late last year to 17 pct without 
consulting Murdoch. Malone's move forced News Corp to set up a poison pill defence, commonly used in the 
United States to prevent hostile takeovers. Goldman Sachs JB Were said the lack of an obvious financial 
advantage from the Fox deal raised questions about why News Corp. was buying out minority shareholders when 
Fox was trading close to a 12-month high. "It's also likely to raise the question whether the transaction is being 
done to coincide with a selective buyback of Liberty Media's non-voting News Corp. stake," Goldman Sachs JB 
Were said in a research note. "The number of shares being issued by News Corp. is spookily similar to the 
number of shares Liberty owns," it said. Shaw Stockbroking head of research Scott Marshall said News Corp. 
needed to resolve the Liberty Media situation one way or another and he believed the Fox transaction made the 
situation with Malone easier to settle. However, he added: "I think it could be resolved irrespective of this Fox 
transaction." News Corp. said its offer represented a premium of 7.4 pct over the Fox share price at Friday's close 
and a premium of 16.9 pct over the average price in the past six months. However, the offer would only stand if 
the company managed to get most of the stock it does not already own. The Fox announcement sent News Corp. 
shares down 38 cents or 2.08 pct to 17.85 usd in New York Monday, while Fox stock rose 3.06 usd or 9.80 
percent to 34.28 usd. News Corp. which is still trading in Sydney, fell 19 cents or just under one pct to end at 
23.78 aud Tuesday. Fox said it had set up a "special committee" of Fox directors who were not members of News 
Corp. to consider the bid. jt/hcw/bmm MMMM

News Corp. looks to acquire rest of Fox Entertainment - UPDATE 6 NEW YORK (XFN-ASIA) -- Rupert 
Murdoch's News Corp. on Monday moved to consolidate its holdings in Fox Entertainment Corp. with a $5.9 
billion offer to acquire the shares of the entertainment group that it doesn't already own. News Corp. said it would 
swap 1.90 Class A common shares for each Fox Class A common share. The deal calls for a 7.4 percent 
premium on Fox shares above last Friday's closing price, but the tracking stock's shares were sent soaring by 
nearly 10 percent, up $3.06 to $34.28. News Corp. shares fell 38 cents to $17.85. Based on the proposed sale 
price, A.G. Edwards analyst Mike Kupinski downgraded Fox shares to "sell." "Investors should consider the time 
value of money," Kupinski wrote in a note to clients. "We do believe that such a merger will be on a fast track." 
The consideration also represents a premium of about 16.9 percent to the stock's six-month average trading 
price. News Corp. 
currently owns about 82.1 percent of the equity and 97 percent of the voting power of Fox through its ownership 
of 59.1 percent of the company's Class A stock and 100 percent of its Class B stock. News Corp. expects Fox's 
board to form a special committee of its directors to review the proposal and make a recommendation to 
shareholders. News Corp.'s Fox Entertainment Group controls the Fox Television Network, Fox cable channels 
and the Twentieth Century Fox movie studio. Murdoch also has interests in publishing and a controlling interest in 
satellite television company DirecTV Group. This story was supplied by CBSMarketWatch. For further information

SYDNEY, Jan 11 (AFP) - 
News Corp.'s announcement of a 5.86 billion US dollar offer to take full control of its Fox Entertainment Group 
has raised prospects the media giant is positioning itself for a deal with John Malone's Liberty Media group, 
analysts said Tuesday. 
News Corp.'s US-based chairman and chief executive, Rupert Murdoch, announced in New York on Monday its 
bid for the 17.9 percent of Fox it does not already own, offering 1.9 of its non-voting shares for each Fox share. 
The offer, worth 5.86 billion dollars based on Friday's closing price for News Corp. shares, had been anticipated 
since the formerly Adelaide-based News Corp. reincorporated in the US state of Delaware in late 2004. 
Fox Entertainment Group controls the Fox Television Network, Fox cable channels and the Twentieth Century 
Fox movie studio. 
"This is a logical step for our company, particularly since our reincorporation in the United States and inclusion in 
the SP 500 (index) has reduced the need to have a separate listing for Fox," News Corp. chief financial officer 
Dave DeVoe told analysts and media on a conference call. 
He said the operational benefits of the transaction were limited but it would represent "a significant milestone" in 
the simplification of the company's structure. 
Some analysts said it also raised questions about whether the bid was a precursor to a move by News Corp. to 
resolve its standoff with John Malone's US cable group Liberty Media which increased its stake in News Corp. 
late last year to 17 percent without consulting Murdoch. 
Malone's move forced News Corp to set up a poison pill defence, commonly used in the United States to prevent 
hostile takeovers. 
Goldman Sachs JB Were said the lack of obvious financial imperative to do the Fox deal raised questions about 
why News Corp. was buying out minority shareholders when Fox was trading close to a 12-month high. 
"It's also likely to raise the question whether the transaction is being done to coincide with a selective buyback of 
Liberty Media's non-voting News Corp. stake," Goldman Sachs JB Were analysts said in a research note. 
"The number of shares being issued by News Corp. is spookily similar to the number of shares Liberty owns." 
Shaw Stockbroking head of research Scott Marshall said News Corp. needed to resolve the Liberty Media 
situation one way or another and he believed the Fox transaction made the situation with Malone easier to settle. 
However, he added: "I think it could be resolved irrespective of this Fox transaction." 
News Corp. said its offer represented a premium of 7.4 percent over the Fox share price at Friday's close and a 
premium of 16.9 percent over the average price in the past six months. 
However, the offer would only stand if the company managed to get most of the stock it does not already own.

News Corp. shares Tuesday fell 19 cents or just under one percent to 23.78 Australian dollars (18.00 US dollars) 
in a modestly rising Australian market. 
Fox said it had set up a "special committee" of Fox directors who were not members of News Corp. to consider 
the bid.

SYDNEY, Jan 11 (AFP) - 
Shares in News Corp Inc. fell sharply in early trading here Tuesday following the media giant's announcement of 
a 5.86-billion-US-dollar, all-stock offer to gain 100 percent ownership of Fox Entertainment Group by buying out 
other shareholders. 
The company's Australian-born US-based chairman and chief executive, Rupert Murdoch, informed the Fox 
subsidiary's board in a letter released in New York that the offer would be made directly to the shareholders later 
in the day. 
News Corp. already owns about 82.1 percent of the equity and 97.0 percent of the voting power of Fox, which 
controls Fox Television Network, Fox cable channels and the Twentieth Century Fox movie studio. 
Under the deal, owners of the Fox Class A shares would get 1.9 News Corp shares for each Fox Class A share. 
A News Corp. executive said that based on Friday's closing price for News Corp. shares, the offer would be worth 
5.86 billion dollars. 
The news sent News Corp. shares down 38 cents, or 2.08 percent, to close at 17.85 US dollars in late New York 
trading while Fox shares soared 3.06 dollars, or 9.80 percent, to 34.28 dollars. 
Within 15 minutes of the market opening in Australia, News shares had fallen 26 cents or 1.08 percent to 23.71 
Australian dollars (18.00 US dollars) while its non-voting stock was down 29 cents or 1.26 percent to 22.67 
Australian dollars in a modestly rising market. 
News Corp said its offer represented a premium of 7.4 percent over the Fox share price at the close of the share 
market on Friday and a premium of 16.9 percent over the average price in the past six months. 
But the offer would only stand if the company managed to get most of the stock it does not now own. 
If successful, News Corp. would end up with at least 90 percent of the equity "and will complete promptly a 
short-form merger," it said in a statement. 
In a statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Fox said it had set up a "special committee" of Fox 
directors who were not members of News Corp. to consider the bid.

NEWS Corp is poised to announce a $US7 billion ($A9.27 billion) bid to buy the rest of Fox Entertainment 
Group, according to media reports. 
The New York Times reported yesterday that News executive chairman Rupert Murdoch was moving to beef up 
his empire in the United States by having News Corp buy out the 17.9 per cent of Fox it does not own for about 
$US7 billion. 
The Wall Street Journal online said Mr Murdoch was expected to announce the deal in the next few days. 
News Corp -- publisher of the Herald Sun -- was unavailable for comment. 
The New York Times said the transaction was approved overnight by News Corp's board and would "solidify 
Murdoch's control over some of the nation's most valuable media assets such as the Fox broadcast network and 
the DirecTV satellite service". 
It was a consolidation move, said Mario Gabelli, chief investment officer of Gabelli Asset Management. 
"The move underscores the simplification process: Mr Murdoch's drive to make News Corp a simpler and more 
shareholder-friendly US company," Mr Gabelli told The New York Times. 
An Australian analyst, who did not wish to be named, said the deal might weaken Mr Murdoch's ability to fight off 
any move by US billionaire John Malone to increase his stake. 
After Mr Malone's Liberty Media took 17 per cent of News Corp last year, News invoked a "poison pill" to protect 
itself from takeover.

GLOBAL media group News Corp is poised to announce a $US7 billion ($A8.9 billion) bid to buy the rest of Fox 
Entertainment Group, according to US media reports. 
The New York Times reported overnight that News was moving to beef up its US strategic position by having 
News Corp buy out the 17.9 per cent of Fox it does not own for about $US7 billion. 
The Wall Street Journal online said News chairman and chief executive Rupert Murdoch was expected to 
announce the deal in the next few days. 
News Corp was unavailable for comment. Media reports said the transaction was approved overnight by News 
Corp's board and would "solidify Mr Murdoch's control over some of the nation's most valuable media assets such 
as the Fox broadcast network and the DirecTV satellite service". 
It was a consolidation move, said Mario Gabelli, chief investment officer of Gabelli Asset Management, whose 
fund owns shares in both News Corp and Fox Entertainment, according to the news report. 
"The move underscores the simplification process: Mr Murdoch's drive to make News Corp a simpler and more 
shareholder-friendly US company," Mr Gabelli told The New York Times. 
An Australian analyst, who did not wish to be named, said the deal might weaken Mr Murdoch's ability to fight off 
any move by US billionaire John Malone to increase his stake. 
After Mr Malone's Liberty Media took 17 per cent of News Corp last year, News invoked a poison pill to protect 
the company from takeover. 
The analyst said Mr Murdoch had few choices if he wanted to consolidate. "The only thing that he could bid for 
would be Fox Entertainment and using debt, but that implies that he's not going to take Malone out for cash," the 
analyst said. 
The New York Times quoted Fulcrum Global Partners media analyst Richard Greenfield as saying the timing of 
the expected deal was "confusing". 
Late last year News Corp reincorporated in the US state of Delaware. 
The move was part of a restructure which saw full control of Queensland Press -- publisher of The Courier-Mail -- 
pass to News Corp via a sale agreement with the Murdoch family's Cruden Investments.

Media 
NEWS Corporation looks set to announce the first big deal since its relocation to the US, with reports last night 
that the media giant would buy out minority shareholders in its Fox Entertainment Group for up to $US7 billion 
($9.2 billion). 
The reports, quoting unnamed executives, said the deal to buy the 18 per cent of Fox that News doesn't already 
own had been approved by the News board and would be announced as early as today. 
The consolidation of the Fox assets -- including the venerable 20th Century Fox film studio -- was widely tipped 
as the first deal for News when chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch completed the company's historic shift from 
Australia to the US in November. 
Fox also houses the Fox broadcast network, US television stations and Fox News Channel. 
A News spokesman declined to comment on the speculation. Fox, with a market value of $US30 billion, was 
originally created by News in 1998 as a "tracking" stock to allow Wall Street to better understand News's Fox 
assets. 
News believed the true value of the Fox assets was hidden within the far-reaching media and communications 
conglomerate, whose interests stretched from pay-TV in Britain to newspapers in Australia, including The 
Australian. 
Last night's reports in The New York Times and Wall Street Journal did not disclose any terms or structure for a 
deal, but in early December News did announce an issue of $US1.5 billion of long-term bonds. This prompted 
some analysts to speculate the raising was the precursor to a big acquisition, with most favouring the 
consolidation of Fox as the most likely transaction. 
A key plank to the acquisition of the Fox minority shareholders is expected to be an offer of shares in News, 
namely News non-voting stock. 
Offering more non-voting stock to shareholders in Fox would dilute existing holders. This was one reason cited by 
analysts for the shock move by Liberty Media's John Malone early last November, when he swapped out of 
non-voting stock and lifted his holding in News voting shares to 17 per cent -- second only to the Murdoch family's 
29.5 per cent. 
Merrill Lynch News analyst Jessica Reif-Cohen said then that Mr Malone was probably swapping his non-voting 
News shares for voting shares to prevent his dilution "from a very likely buy-in of Fox using (non-voting) stock". 
And a report late last year by investment bank Morgan Stanley said the exchange of News shares for Fox 
minority interests would boost earnings per share for News. 
Issuing more non-voting shares comes after the traditional discount on the non-voting stock to News's voting 
shares has narrowed, a reflection of the company's move to the US, where investors are less discriminating about 
voting and non-voting scrip.

Page 122 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
But Mr Malone's aggressive move on to the voting registry prompted News to introduce a poison-pill clause in its 
constitution to thwart any hostile takeover moves by the media entrepreneur. 
The relationship between Mr Malone and Mr Murdoch is unclear -- but analysts expect more deals between the 
two in 2005. 
Fox shares have been trading around $US31 a share, valuing the minority shares at around $US5.4 billion. The 
stock is up from about $US25 in November when News shifted to Delaware.

The deal will give News full control of some of America's most valuable media assets. 
RUPERT Murdoch's News Corp is close to clinching its first major deal since switching bases from Australia to 
the US - a buy-out of all minority interests in its Fox Entertainment Group that could cost the media empire $US7 
billion (A$9.3 billion). 
Though the company's New York spokesman would not confirm the deal late last night (Australian time), analysts 
were confident that News planned to privatise Fox - which has been listed for only six years - with details of a 
share offer for the 17.9 per cent of Fox in public hands to be released within days. 
The New York Times has reported that the News Corp board signed off on the purchase on Sunday night. 
The deal - which Mr Murdoch foreshadowed at the annual meeting in Adelaide in November - will give News full 
control over some of the US's most valuable media assets, such as the Fox Broadcast Network, the DirecTV 
satellite and 21st Century Fox film studios, and help simplify the global media group's complex structure. 
"It makes absolute sense to take out Fox just to clean up the structure," UBS media analyst Tony Wilson said. 
"That's where a lot of the growth in the share price is going to come from. 
"And it makes sense to do it sooner rather than later, because we think Fox has a very good 12 months ahead of 
it, in which case the price for it will rise." 
News raised $US2.8 billion in 1998 selling the minority stake in Fox, which has since issued further shares to buy 
DirecTV, contributing to the increased cost of privatising the business. 
Based on the closing price of $US31.22 on Wall Street on Friday, the Fox Group's last 17.9 per cent is capitalised 
at $US5.44 billion. Analysts expected minority shareholders to haggle for a premium for their shares in a 
company that last year boosted operating income nearly 28 per cent to $US2.3 billion. News is expected to issue 
more limited-voting stock to fund the deal. 
"I think there will be a little bit of EPS accretion for News if they can do it for less than $US35 per share," Mr 
Wilson said. 
While Wall Street pundits hailed the move to make News Corp a "more shareholder-friendly US company", some 
argued that Mr Murdoch should be trying to seek a peace agreement with rival baron John Malone before going 
after Fox. 
In November, Mr Malone's Liberty Media stunned the Murdoch camp by agreeing to buy 8 per cent of News Corp 
voting shares from institutional bank Merrill Lynch. The deal with Merrill - made possible by the large amount of 
loose News Corp stock as Australian investors exited the register - effectively brought Liberty up to 17 per cent 
control of News Corp, second only to the Murdochs, who have around 30 per cent. 
A week later, News introduced a poison-pill provision to thwart would-be predators and keep Mr Murdoch in 
control of the company, which he plans to turn over to sons Lachlan and James.

SYDNEY, Jan 11 AAP - News Corp Inc's $US5.86 billion ($A7.74 billion) bid for the remainder of Fox 
Entertainment Group prompted speculation today it could be linked to a resolution of a stand-off with John 
Malone's Liberty Media Corp. 
Rupert Murdoch's media company moved overnight to consolidate its complex global structure by offering to 
swap its own stock for the 17.9 per cent of Fox shares it does not already own. 
News Corp chief financial officer Dave DeVoe presented the deal as a tidy-up operation that gave the group 100 
per cent control of the lucrative film and television company that includes 20th Century Fox film studios among its 
assets. 
"It's a logical step ... particularly since our reincorporation in the US and inclusion in the S&P500 has reduced the 
need to have a separate listing for Fox," Mr DeVoe told analysts via a conference call from the US. 
The Fox consolidation had been widely tipped after News Corp shifted its base from Adelaide to the US state of 
Delaware in November and listed on the US S&P500 index last month. 
However, most analysts expected News Corp's first big initiative as a US company would be to resolve a potential 
threat from Mr Malone's US cable group. 
Liberty Media snapped up 17 per cent of News Corp behind Mr Murdoch's back on November 4 last year, 
prompting News Corp to set up a poison pill provision to protect it from takeover. 
Goldman Sachs JB Were analysts said a lack of obvious financial imperative to do the Fox deal raised questions 
about why News Corp was buying out the minorities when Fox shares were trading close to a 12 month high. 
"It's also likely to raise the question whether the transaction is being done to coincide with a selective buyback of 
Liberty Media's non-voting News Corp stake," the analysts said in a research note. 
However, Shaw Stockbroking head of research Scott Marshall said while Mr Murdoch needed to resolve the 
situation with Mr Malone, the Fox deal was not necessarily a part of that process. 
"News Corp needs to resolve the Liberty situation one way or another," Mr Marshall said. 
"But I don't think that resolving the Fox situation is a necessary precursor to resolving the Liberty situation." 
ABN Amro analyst Peter Shorthouse said he did not think the deals were directly linked. 
"It's easy to conclude it has something to do with Liberty but I think they were going ahead with this even before 
Liberty made its stock increase," Mr Shorthouse said. 
"They must have considered what Liberty is up to in doing this, but I don't think there is any direct correlation 
between this transaction and a potential Liberty transaction." 
News Corp shares fell 19 cents to $23.78 on the Australian Stock Exchange while its non-voting securities slid 34 
cents to $22.62. 
Mr Marshall said the share price drop was likely to be temporary because the Fox deal was positive for News 
Corp.

"The company said it will be issuing about 10 per cent of its issued capital to fund the Fox acquisition and 
whenever a company issues that many shares you get weakness in the share price," Mr Marshall said. 
"I'm seeing this as a temporary, market-related weakness and it should recover." 
News Corp owns 82.1 per cent of the equity and 97 per cent of the voting power of Fox. 
It is offering 1.9 of its non voting shares for every Fox share.

"News Corp needs to resolve the Liberty situation one way or another," Mr Marshall said. 
"But I don't think that resolving the Fox situation is a necessary precursor to resolving the Liberty situation." 
ABN Amro analyst Peter Shorthouse said he did not think the deals were directly linked. 
"It's easy to conclude it has something to do with Liberty but I think they were going ahead with this even before 
Liberty made its stock increase," Mr Shorthouse said. 
"They must have considered what Liberty is up to in doing this, but I don't think there is any direct correlation 
between this transaction and a potential Liberty transaction." 
News Corp shares fell 19 cents to $23.78 on the Australian Stock Exchange while its non-voting securities slid 34 
cents to $22.62. 
Mr Marshall said the share price drop was likely to be temporary because the Fox deal was positive for News 
Corp.

"The company said it will be issuing about 10 per cent of its issued capital to fund the Fox acquisition and 
whenever a company issues that many shares you get weakness in the share price," Mr Marshall said. 
"I'm seeing this as a temporary, market-related weakness and it should recover." 
News Corp owns 82.1 per cent of the equity and 97 per cent of the voting power of Fox. 
It is offering 1.9 of its non voting shares for every Fox share.

Murdoch's Fox move raises speculation abourt a Liberty deal

NEWS By Liza Kappelle 
SYDNEY, Jan 11 AAP - News Corp's decision to consolidate with a $US5.86 billion ($A7.74 billion) bid for the 
remainder of Fox Entertainment Group has raised questions about a potential deal with John Malone's Liberty 
Media group. 
Rupert Murdoch's global media group overnight offered to buy the 17.9 per cent of Fox it does not own by 
offering 1.9 shares of its non-voting stock for each Fox share. 
News Corp chief financial officer Dave DeVoe said the media group's board of directors approved the deal 
overnight. 
"This is a logical step for our company, particularly since our reincorporation in the United States and inclusion in 
the S&P500 has reduced the need to have a separate listing for Fox," Mr DeVoe told analysts and media on a 
conference call in the US. 
"While we believe that there is much merit in completing this transaction, we also note that we obviously already 
control and operate Fox through our 82 per cent position and therefore the operational benefits of this transaction 
are limited. 
"(But) it will be a significant milestone in the simplification of our company structure." 
The deal had been anticipated by the market since News Corp reincorporated in the United States late in 2004. 
But some analysts had been expecting Mr Murdoch to resolve a standoff with John Malone's US cable group 
Liberty Media ahead of any move to consolidate Fox. 
After Liberty Media took 17 per cent of News Corp late last year, without consulting Mr Murdoch, News Corp set 
up a poison pill provision to protect the global media group from takeover. 
Goldman Sachs JB Were said the lack of obvious financial imperative to do the deal raised questions about why 
News Corp was buying out the minorities when Fox was trading close to a 12 month high. 
"It's also likely to raise the question whether the transaction is being done to coincide with a selective buyback of 
Liberty Media's non-voting News Corp stake," Goldman Sachs JB Were said in a research note. 
News Corp told analysts the Fox transaction was a stand alone deal. 
"(But) the number of shares being issued by News Corp is spookily similar to the number of shares Liberty owns," 
Goldman Sachs JB Were said. 
"This may be entirely coincidental, but is no doubt going to add to the speculation." 
Shaw Stockbroking head of research Scott Marshall said Mr Murdoch needed to resolve the situation with fellow 
media tycoon Mr Malone. 
"News Corp needs to resolve the Liberty situation one way or another," Mr Marshall said. 
"I think it could be resolved irrespective of this Fox transaction.

Page 130 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"I think they are things that would happen at around the same time but I don't think that resolving the Fox situation 
is a necessary precursor to resolving the Liberty situation. 
"It may make any dealing easier, but I don't think its a necessary precursor." 
News Corp shares fell 23 cents to $23.74 by 1210 AEDT while its non voting securities slid 30 cents to $22.66 
after the announcement. 
Mr Marshall said the deal was positive for News Corp and the share price drop was likely to be temporary. 
"The company said it will be issuing about 10 per cent of its issued capital to fund the Fox acquisition and 
whenever a company issues that many shares you get weakness in the share price," Mr Marshall said. 
"I'm seeing this as a temporary, market-related weakness and it should recover. 
News Corp owns 82.1 per cent of the equity and 97 per cent of the voting power of Fox. 
It owns about 59.1 per cent of the outstanding Fox Class A common stock and all of the Fox Class B common 
stock.

Murdoch's News Corp. offers to buy rest of Fox Entertainment stock for $5.9B US

NEW YORK (AP) _ Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., moving to regain full control of its majority owned Fox 
television properties, is offering to buy the remaining publicly held shares of Fox Entertainment Group Inc. in a 
$5.9 billion US stock deal. 
The exchange offer announced Monday would solidify Murdoch's control over the Fox assets which include the 
Fox broadcast network as well as Fox news and sports channels, the 20th Century Fox movie studio and a 
controlling interest in satellite television giant DirecTV. 
The move had been expected following the November decision by News Corp., which also owns newspaper, 
book publishing, television and satellite TV assets around the world, to move its base from the United States from 
Australia. 
``Given the News reincorportation in the U.S., we saw little reason for Fox to continue as a separate carved out 
entity and as such believed that the takeout was likely,'' Prudential Equity Group Inc. analyst Katherine Styponias 
said in a research note. 
Under the deal announced Monday, News Corp. would offer to exchange 1.9 shares of News Corp. stock for 
each outstanding Fox Class A share that it doesn't already own. 
News Corp. currently owns approximately 82.1 per cent of the equity and 97 per cent of the voting power of Fox 
Entertainment. It owns about 59.1 per cent of the outstanding Fox Class A common stock and all of the Fox 
Class B common stock. 
Based on Friday's closing prices, the company said the exchange offer represented a premium of approximately 
7.4 per cent for the Fox Class A shares. 
There are about 175 million Fox Class A shares that are not held by News Corp. Fox Class A shares closed at 
$31.22 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, valuing the Fox shares News Corp. doesn't own at $5.46 
billion. 
A 7.4 per cent premium would value those shares at about $33.53 each for a total of nearly $5.9 billion. 
Analysts were mixed whether the News Corp. offer was adequate. 
``We disagree... that the offer constitutes a fair and full price,'' Styponias, the Prudential analyst, said in her 
report. ``A price closer to $37 is what they should hold out for.'' 
Styponias also downgraded Fox shares from overweight to neutral, citing the limited upside because of the News 
Corp. offer. 
In another research report, Oppenheimer & Co. said acknowledged News Corp. offer ``may seem small, but the 
transaction is not a necessity for NWS, and changes virtually nothing operationally. We see little likelihood for 
NWS increasing its offer.'' 
In early afternoon trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, News Corp. shares slipped 33 cents, or 1.8 
per cent, to $17.90. 
Fox Entertainment shares rose $2.85, or 9.1 per cent, to $34.07 _ positioning the stock for a new 52-week high.

News Corp. also expects that the Fox board will form a special committee of Fox directors who are not directors 
or executive officers of News Corp. to consider the proposal and make a recommendation to Fox shareholders 
regarding the deal.

NEW YORK Murdoch is expected to buy out Fox units 
Rupert Murdoch is expected to announce today that he will buy out the shareholders of his Fox properties for 
about $7 billion, executives involved in the deal said Sunday night. 
Murdoch's main company is the News Corp., which owns newspapers, television, film and satellite assets around 
the globe. 
He owns his U.S. assets through the Fox Entertainment Group, which News Corp. controls. Fox Entertainment 
owns the Fox broadcast network, Fox News, Fox Sports Net, the movie companies 21st Century Fox and Fox 
Searchlights and the DirecTV satellite service. 
Exact terms of the deal could not be learned. Fox shares closed Friday at $31.22. 
News Corp. earns about 75 percent of its revenue and profit in the United States. 
HAWAII Sub is due at base after running aground 
A nuclear submarine that ran aground about 350 miles south of Guam, killing one crewman and injuring 23 
others, was due back at its home port in Guam today, according to a Navy spokesman. 
There were no reports of damage to the San Francisco's reactor plant, but the extent of damage to the 360-foot 
submarine would be determined when it gets to port, said Jon Yoshishige, spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Fleet. 
The vessel was moving under its own power. 
Officials said they still don't know what the submarine hit Saturday. Lt. j.g. Adam Clampitt of the Pacific Fleet said 
it had been conducting operations underwater at the time. 
CAMARILLO, Calif. Prices at gas pumps dipped since Dec. 17 
Gas prices have dipped slightly since last month, an industry analyst said Sunday. 
From Dec. 17 to Friday, the combined average price for all grades of gasoline declined more than 3 cents a 
gallon, to $1.82, compared to the previous two weeks, said analyst Trilby Lundberg, who publishes the 
semimonthly Lundberg Survey of 7,000 gas stations across the country. 
The average national price for self-serve regular, the most popular, was $1.79 a gallon, midgrade was $1.90 and 
premium was $1.99 a gallon for the period. 
WASHINGTON Stand-ins attend inaugural rehearsal 
Officials held a daylong dress rehearsal on Capitol Hill Sunday for President George W. Bush's inauguration 
ceremony. Various people stood in for the president, Laura Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and their families.

Bush's swearing-in is scheduled at noon on Jan. 20. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, although battling cancer, 
is planning to perform the ceremony. 
ORANGE CITY, Fla. Sinkhole destroys home, forces evacuations 
A large sinkhole opened Sunday in Orange City, destroying one house, damaging a second and forcing the 
temporary evacuation of 11 others. No injuries were reported. 
A woman fled with her baby before their home sank to the level of its roof, Volusia County spokesman Dave 
Byron said. 
The 110-foot-wide hole also damaged a road, he said. 
Sinkholes are common in central Florida. They form when erosion enlarges underground caverns and the 
formations collapse. 
Orange City is about 20 miles southwest of Daytona Beach. 
TUCSON, Ariz. Biosphere 2 owners put up For Sale sign 
The company that owns Bio-sphere 2 Center, 3.1 glass-enclosed acres designed to simulate the Earth's 
environment, has put the structure up for sale. 
The company is also selling 70 other buildings on the center's 140-acre campus 16 miles north of Tucson, said 
Christopher Bannon, general manager of Decisions Investment Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas. 
Texas billionaire Ed Bass, president of Decisions Investment, spent more than $200 million to build Biosphere 2 
in the 1980s as a prototype for a space colony. 
In 1991, eight "biospherians" were sealed inside for a two-year stay. But the project was plagued by rising costs 
and other setbacks. Columbia University assumed responsibility for the site under a management agreement. 
The relationship with Columbia ended in September 2003.

NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. (NWS.N) on Monday said it would take full 
control of its Fox Entertainment Group Inc. (FOX.N) unit in a stock swap worth about $6 billion, which it said 
would simplify the media conglomerate's structure. 
The deal, which sent Fox shares up 10 percent, gives News Corp. full ownership of its U.S. entertainment assets 
such as 20th Century Fox film studios, Fox Network, Fox News Channel and its stake in satellite broadcaster 
DirecTV, which could make it easier for Murdoch to pursue acquisitions. 
The company originally sold an 18.6 percent stake in Fox Entertainment in an initial public offering in late 1998 
as a way for U.S. institutional shareholders forbidden from buying shares of a foreign company to invest in a 
U.S.-based, News Corp.-controlled property. 
With the reincorporation of News Corp. in the United States late last year, it made little sense to maintain two 
publicly traded U.S. entities, executives told analysts in a morning conference. 
"Since the reincorporating of News Corp. in the U.S., the logic for Fox no longer exists," David DeVoe, News Corp 
chief financial officer, told the analysts. "We really took Fox public as a way to drive value into the stock." 
But he cautioned, "The operational benefits are limited." The company already controls Fox and expects to see 
operational cost savings of about $3 million to $7 million. 
Analysts said it could make News Corp.'s pursuit of U.S. deals easier. 
"He has one currency now, it makes life simpler," said Mario Gabelli, fund manager of Gabelli Asset 
Management. Gabelli said the transaction could facilitate the pursuit of future deals. 
The transaction comes after Liberty Media Corp. (L.N) Chairman John Malone raised his voting stake in News 
Corp. to 18 percent, and News Corp enacted a poison pill provision to make a hostile takeover prohibitively 
expensive. 
UNDER SHAREHOLDER FIRE 
Completing its acquisition of Fox could help News Corp. execute a deal easier with Liberty Media, analysts said. 
"It may facilitate a transaction with Liberty, if it involves a Fox asset in a cash rich split-off," said Richard 
Greenfield, an analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners. 
In recent weeks, Malone and Murdoch have mulled plans to whittle down Liberty Media's voting stake in the 
media conglomerate. One prevailing scenario involves a tax-efficient deal called a "cash-rich split-off," wherein 
one company which owns a big stake in another company agrees to hand over the shares in exchange for cash 
and a small business. 
DeVoe said the transaction had little to do with any other potential transactions. 
Holders of Fox Class A shares will receive 1.90 shares of News Corp. Class A shares, representing a premium of 
about 7.4 percent over Fox's closing price Friday of $31.22 and about 18 percent higher than its 12-month trading 
price on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Although Wall Street called the deal "fairly valued," not all Fox shareholders agreed.

Page 138 of 160 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Law firm Faruqi & Faruqi filed a lawsuit on behalf of a group of unnamed Fox shareholders charging News Corp. 
with grossly undervaluing Fox. 
"The consideration to be paid to (Fox shareholders) is unconscionable and unfair and grossly inadequate," Faruqi 
& Faruqi said in a statement. 
Faruqi & Faruqi did not return calls. 
News Corp., which currently holds about 82 percent of the equity and 97 percent of the voting power of Fox, 
made about $2.8 billion, or $22.50 a share, in 1998 in a public offering of Fox. 
Fox shares gained $3.06 to $34.28; News Corp shares fell 38 cents to $17.85 on the New York Stock Exchange.

News Corporation, the global media and entertainment group led by Rupert Murdoch, today announced an 
estimated $7bn buy-out of minority shareholders in Fox Entertainment. 
News Corp, which already controls 82.1 per cent of the equity and 97 per cent of the voting shares in Fox, is 
offering an all-paper deal to Fox shareholders that will consolidate the group's media holdings in the US. 
Mr Murdoch first mooted a buy out last autumn, but the deal is thought to have been put to the News Corp board 
at the weekend following the company's re-incorporation in the US and shift of its main stock market listing from 
Sydney to New York. 
Fox assets include the controversial cable news channel, the Twentieth Century Fox studio and a controlling 
stake in DirecTV, the country's largest satellite TV platform. 
Under the terms of the deal, holders of Fox class A common stock will receive shares in News Corp on a 1.9-for-1 
ratio. The company said the offer represent a premium of about 7.4 per cent Fox's closing price on January 7, and 
a 16.9 per cent to the average trading price over the last six months. 
Details of the offer are expected to be filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission later today. 
The offer will be considered by Fox directors - not linked to News Corp - who are likely to form a special 
committee to make a recommendation to minority shareholders. 
Analysts at CSFB said: "We believe the motivations of News Corp's management could reolve around 
simplification of the group's structure given that complexity has historically been one of the factors behind News 
Corp's valuation discount to its peer group." 
An all paper deal would leave Mr Murdoch with cash reserves at News Corp to fund a possible buy-back of voting 
shares acquired by Liberty Media, the media investment company led by John Malone. 
Mr Malone surprised News Corp last November by taking an option to increase his voting stake in the company to 
18 per cent, second only to the Murdoch family's 29 per cent holding. 
News Corp is considering various options to resolve the situation - including a possible shares and asset deal in 
which Mr Malone would swap his News Corp stock for a mixture of assets, cash and shares in a new vehicle 
combining some of Liberty and News Corp's TV channels. 
But some people close to the situation cautioned that a deal was not imminent, and declined to discuss possible 
terms. Instead, the company was said to be keen to simplify its structure following its re-listing in the US, negating 
the need for a separate Fox share listing.

News Corporation, the media empire led by Rupert Murdoch, is poised to buy full control of Fox Entertainment 
in a deal estimated to be worth about $7bn. 
The company, which already owns 82 per cent of Fox, is expected shortly to announce a buy-out of the remaining 
minority shareholders, according to people familiar with the situation. 
Mr Murdoch first mooted a buy out last autumn, but the deal is thought to have been put to the News Corp board 
following the company's re-incorporation in the US and shift of its main stock market listing from Sydney to New 
York. 
The New York Times, citing executives involved in the deal, said the buy-out would solidify Mr Murdoch's control 
over some of the most valuable media assets in the US. Fox controls the cable news station, the Twentieth 
Century Fox studio and a controlling stake in DirecTV, the country's largest satellite TV platform. 
Industry analysts expect an all-stock or equity funded buy-out as the most likely option. 
Analysts at CSFB said: "We believe the motivations of News Corp's management could reolve around 
simplification of the group's structure given that complexity has historically been one of the factors behind News 
Corp's valuation discount to its peer group." 
News Corp already controls management and cash-flow at Fox. 
A buy-out valued at about $7bn would represent a premium of close to 20 per cent for minority shareholders. 
An all paper deal would leave Mr Murdoch with cash reserves at News Corp to fund a possible buy-back of voting 
shares acquired by Liberty Media, the media investment company led by John Malone. 
Mr Malone surprised News Corp last November by taking an option to increase his voting stake in the company to 
18 per cent, second only to the Murdoch family's 29 per cent holding. 
News Corp is considering various options to resolve the situation - including a possible shares and asset deal in

minority stake in Fox Entertainment Group Inc. (FOX) it doesn't already own in an all-stock deal initially valued at 
about $5.9 billion. 
Some analysts and investors said News Corp.'s offer seemed skimpy. Trading activity in both companies' shares 
suggests some investors hope News Corp. will raise its offer, but News Corp. executives said the offer stands. 
News Corp., Rupert Murdoch's New York-based media empire, already owns about 82.1% of Fox 
Entertainment's equity and 97% of the unit's voting power. Fox Entertainment comprises filmed entertainment 
and cable and broadcast television assets. 
News Corp. first sold a minority stake in Fox Entertainment to the public in 1998, partially to make it easier for 
American investors to buy into Murdoch's empire. At the time, News Corp. was an Australian company and some 
institutional investors in the U.S. were limited in buying its American depositary shares. Fox Entertainment's 
Class A shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange to avoid such limitations. 
But last year, News Corp. reincorporated as an American company and listed its shares on the NYSE. Executives 
began to see the two NYSE-listed stocks as duplicative, and Murdoch had hinted at a full takeover of Fox in the 
fall. 
"This is a logical step for our company, particularly since our recent reincorporation to the U.S....has reduced the 
need to have a separate listing for Fox," Chief Financial Officer David DaVoe said Monday during a conference 
call with analysts and investors. 
Also, DaVoe said the acquisition of all of Fox would add to News Corp.'s earnings, and would save between $3 
million and $7 million in costs such as legal and audit fees. 
DaVoe said there was no strategic benefit to the proposed deal because News Corp. already consolidates the 
results from Fox Entertainment on its financial statements. Also, he said it wouldn't hurt either company's 
operations if the deal didn't go through. 
News Corp. offered to exchange 1.9 of its Class A shares for each Fox Entertainment share. Based on Friday's 
closing prices, the offer valued Fox Entertainment shares at $33.54, a 7.4% premium to the $31.22 closing price 
for Fox shares. News Corp. Class A shares closed Friday at $17.65. 
However, news of the offer sent Fox shares up Monday. They recently traded up 9.4%, or $2.94, to $34.16, in 
heavy trading, ahead of the offer price. News Corp. Class A shares were down 47 cents, or 2.7%, to $17.18, 
implying an offer value of about $32.93 a share. 
"The premium seems a little bit skinny based on a number of factors," Scott Capelli, an analyst with Copper Art 
Capital, which owns Fox shares, said during the conference call with News Corp. executives. 
Capelli said premiums in such deals usually exceed 7%. And he suggested that a comparison of Fox to the 
valuations of Viacom Inc. (VIA, VIAB) and Time Warner Inc. (TWX) would imply a fair value for Fox of $41 per 
share.

But DaVoe said the company's offer stands as is. "We think it is a fair and full price," he said. He noted that the 
offer price represents an even higher premium when compared to Fox's average trading price in the past year. 
JB Hanauer & Co. analyst David Joyce also said News Corp.'s offer seemed to under-value Fox, as Joyce thinks 
a fair price would have been $35.71 per Fox share. 
News Corp. "could still easily argue this is a fair level to buy in at," Joyce said. But, "it's just as easy to argue it's a 
skimpy premium to where it was trading last Friday." Joyce doesn't own shares in either company and his firm 
doesn't provide investment-banking services to them. 
Still, Joyce said he thinks the deal will go through because the offer price is "close enough." Under terms of the 
offer, the deal will close when the offer is accepted by a majority of the holders of the publicly held minority stake. 
News Corp. said it expects Fox's board to form a special committee of directors who aren't also directors or 
officers with News Corp. to consider the offer and make a recommendation to Fox shareholders. The offer could 
still go through even if the committee came out against the offer, News Corp. executives said.

WSJ UPDATE: News Corp. Under Pressure To Raise Bid

Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--News Corp. (NWS) unveiled a long-awaited offer of more than $5.7 billion worth of its 
shares for the stock it doesn't already own in Fox Entertainment Group Inc. (FOX), but the media giant 
immediately came under pressure to raise the offer price. 
Shares of Fox, of which News Corp. owns 82%, soared 10% to $34.37 in recent New York Stock Exchange 
composite trading, taking them above the value of the offer. 
Still, News Corp. Chief Financial Officer David DeVoe told analysts that News Corp. was offering a "full and fair 
price." 
(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) 
Fox Entertainment houses the Fox broadcast network and television-station group, cable channels such as Fox 
News Channel and the 20th Century Fox film studio. Expectations had risen over the past few months that News 
Corp. would make the offer, fueled by comments from News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch in October that an 
offer would be considered. 
News Corp. sold to the public a minority stake in Fox in late 1998 to make it easier for U.S. investors to invest in 
News Corp.-controlled assets. Until recently, News Corp. was domiciled in Australia, which restricted the number 
of U.S. investors who could buy its stock. But it moved its domicile to Delaware in November. The shift meant the 
logic of having Fox as a separate stock "no longer exists," DeVoe said. 
News Corp. is offering 1.9 of its nonvoting Class A shares for every Fox share. At Friday's close, that ratio valued 
Fox shares at $33.54, compared with Fox's close of $31.22. But in the wake of the offer, News Corp. Class A 
shares dropped 29 cents to $17.36, reducing the value of the offer to $32.98, while Fox shares rose. 
News Corp. said that the offer was a premium of 16.9% to Fox's average price over the past six months. Fox 
shares have risen sharply in recent months from around $25 in the summer. News Corp. said it expected Fox's 
board to form a special committee of independent directors to consider the proposal. 
Perhaps anticipating pressure from minority shareholders for a higher price, DeVoe played down the significance 
of the offer for News Corp. 
"There are no strategic benefits at all," he told analysts, noting it would help simplify the company's capital 
structure. News Corp. would save some money on "public-company expenses," he said. He denied the timing of 
the offer was related to News Corp.'s discussions with Liberty Media Corp. (L) about a buyback of Liberty stock in 
News Corp. "This transaction doesn't have any bearing on any other transaction," DeVoe said. 
Still, full ownership of Fox could make it easier for News Corp. to offer Fox assets in a buyback. News Corp. and 
Liberty are expected to negotiate a buyback in coming months under which News Corp. would trade an asset and 
a large amount of cash for a big chunk of Liberty's $9 billion stake in News Corp. Liberty's stake includes an 18% 
voting stake in News Corp. as well as a large amount of nonvoting shares.

NEW YORK (AP) _ Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., moving to regain full control of its majority owned Fox 
television properties, is offering to buy the remaining publicly held shares of Fox Entertainment Group Inc. in a 
$5.9 billion US stock deal. 
The exchange offer announced Monday would solidify Murdoch's control over the Fox assets which include the 
Fox broadcast network as well as Fox news and sports channels, the 20th Century Fox movie studio and a 
controlling interest in satellite television giant DirecTV. 
The move had been expected following the November decision by News Corp., which also owns newspaper, 
book publishing, television and satellite TV assets around the world, to move its base from the United States from 
Australia. 
``Given the News reincorportation in the U.S., we saw little reason for Fox to continue as a separate carved out 
entity and as such believed that the takeout was likely,'' Prudential Equity Group Inc. analyst Katherine Styponias 
said in a research note. 
Under the deal announced Monday, News Corp. would offer to exchange 1.9 shares of News Corp. stock for 
each outstanding Fox Class A share that it doesn't already own. 
News Corp. currently owns approximately 82.1 per cent of the equity and 97 per cent of the voting power of Fox 
Entertainment. It owns about 59.1 per cent of the outstanding Fox Class A common stock and all of the Fox 
Class B common stock. 
Based on Friday's closing prices, the company said the exchange offer represented a premium of approximately 
7.4 per cent for the Fox Class A shares. 
There are about 175 million Fox Class A shares that are not held by News Corp. Fox Class A shares closed at 
$31.22 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, valuing the Fox shares News Corp. doesn't own at $5.46 
billion. 
A 7.4 per cent premium would value those shares at about $33.53 each for a total of nearly $5.9 billion. 
Analysts were mixed whether the News Corp. offer was adequate. 
``We disagree... that the offer constitutes a fair and full price,'' Styponias, the Prudential analyst, said in her 
report. ``A price closer to $37 is what they should hold out for.'' 
Styponias also downgraded Fox shares from overweight to neutral, citing the limited upside because of the News 
Corp. offer. 
In another research report, Oppenheimer & Co. said acknowledged News Corp. offer ``may seem small, but the 
transaction is not a necessity for NWS, and changes virtually nothing operationally. We see little likelihood for 
NWS increasing its offer.'' 
In early afternoon trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, News Corp. shares slipped 33 cents, or 1.8 
per cent, to $17.90. 
Fox Entertainment shares rose $2.85, or 9.1 per cent, to $34.07 _ positioning the stock for a new 52-week high.

News Corp. also expects that the Fox board will form a special committee of Fox directors who are not directors 
or executive officers of News Corp. to consider the proposal and make a recommendation to Fox shareholders 
regarding the deal.

Murdoch to Buy Rest of Fox for $7 Billion

Murdoch to Buy Rest of Fox for $7 Billion

Rupert Murdoch, consolidating his global media empire in the United States, is expected to announce today that 
he will buy out the shareholders of his Fox properties for about $7 billion, executives involved in the deal said last 
night. 
The deal would solidify Mr. Murdoch's control over some of the nation's most valuable media assets like the Fox 
broadcast network and the DirecTV satellite service and help simplify the complicated structure of his far-flung 
company, the News Corporation, which includes newspapers, television, film and satellite assets around the 
globe. 
It also puts Mr. Murdoch in a better position to leverage his full ownership of the Fox Entertainment Group for 
future deals. 
The transaction, which the board of News Corporation approved last night, would also make Mr. Murdoch's 
company an even more formidable media power in the United States. Mr. Murdoch, who gave up his Australian 
citizenship 19 years ago to become a United States citizen, recently reincorporated News Corporation in the 
United States and shifted its primary stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange from the Australian exchange. 
''The move underscores the simplification process: Mr. Murdoch's drive to make News Corporation a simpler and 
more shareholder-friendly U.S. company,'' said Mario Gabelli, chief investment officer of Gabelli Asset 
Management, whose fund owns shares of both News Corporation and Fox Entertainment. 
The move to bring Fox Entertainment back inside the fold of News Corporation also gives Mr. Murdoch more 
flexibility to wield his deal-making muscle in the United States, where he used to have to rely on the often faltering 
stock price of his Fox subsidiary as leverage for deals. 
''This makes it easier for News Corp. to do deals. It simplifies the structure and gives it full control over the deal 
making process,'' said Harold L. Vogel, an entertainment analyst. 
The timing of the transaction raises questions about the status of Mr. Murdoch's feud with John C. Malone, the 
chairman of Liberty Media, who raised his company's investment in the News Corporation to 17 percent in 
November behind the back of Mr. Murdoch, who owns a 30 percent voting stake. 
Only a week later, News Corporation introduced a plan to thwart would-be hostile bidders and keep Mr. Murdoch 
in control of the company, which he plans to turn over to his sons: Lachlan, now deputy chief operating officer, 
and James, chief executive of British Sky Broadcasting, Mr. Murdoch's satellite TV company in Britain. 
''The timing is confusing because we had expected Mr. Murdoch to complete a transaction with Mr. Malone before 
buying in Fox,'' said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners. A spokesman for News 
Corporation declined to comment.

NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Monday said it would buy the remaining 18 
percent of its Fox Entertainment Group Inc. unit in a stock swap worth roughly $6 billion, which analysts said 
would simplify the media conglomerate's structure. 
The deal gives News Corp. full ownership of its U.S. entertainment assets such as 20th Century Fox film studios, 
Fox Network, Fox News Channel and its stake in satellite broadcaster DirecTV, which could make it easier for 
Murdoch to pursue acquisitions. 
"He has one currency now, it makes life simpler," said Mario Gabelli, fund manager of Gabelli Asset 
Management. 
Holders of Fox Class A shares will receive 1.90 shares of News Corp. Class A shares, representing a premium of 
about 7.4 percent over Fox's closing price Friday of $31.22 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Fox shares rose 7.3 percent to $34.00 in premarket trade on the INET brokerage. News Corp. shares rose 1 cent 
to $18.24. 
News Corp., which was recently reincorporated in the United States, currently holds about 82 percent of the 
equity and 97 percent of the voting power of Fox. 
The transaction comes after Liberty Media Corp. Chairman John Malone raised his voting stake in News Corp. to 
18 percent, and News Corp enacted a poison pill provision to make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive. 
News Corp. originally sold an 18.6 percent stake in Fox Entertainment in an initial public offering in late 1998, 
yielding $2.8 billion at $22.50 a share. At the time, the company, whose other businesses include newspaper, 
magazine and book publishing as well as cable and satellite television operations in Asia and Europe, said the 
market undervalued its U.S. media assets.

NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. is expected to announced a multibillion dollar bid 
to buy the shares of Fox Entertainment Group Inc. that it does not already own, according to media reports. 
The New York Times reported that Murdoch is expected to announce on Monday he will buy out the shareholders 
of his Fox properties for about $7 billion, citing executives involved in the deal. News Corp. currently owns 82.1 
percent of Fox Entertainment Group. 
A report on the Wall Street Journal's online edition dated Sunday said News Corp. will announce a 
"multibillion-dollar stock bid" in the next few days for the shares it doesn't already own in Fox Entertainment 
Group. The report cited a person familiar with the situation. 
The New York Times said the transaction was approved by the board of News Corp. and would solidify Murdoch's 
control over some of the nation's most valuable media assets such as the Fox broadcast network and the DirecTV 
satellite service. 
Built by Murdoch from a single newspaper in Adelaide, Australia, News Corp. now ranks as one of the world's 
biggest media empires. Last year, it reincorporated in the United States and shifted its main stock market listing to 
the New York Stock Exchange from Australia. 
News Corp. declined to comment.
