Cisco Systems Inc. made its name supplying the gear that controls the movement of data over the Internet. Now 
that online video appears poised to boost Internet growth, Cisco is moving to supply gear that moves video off 
the Internet and into the home. 
Two recent acquisitions are the clearest sign yet that the U.S. company, which has $24.8 billion in annual 
revenue, sees bandwidth-hungry video as a significant future market. In the next decade, video will sharply 
increase the load on the routers and switches that handle Internet traffic, said John Chambers, Cisco's chief 
executive. 
The role of video in Cisco's future took center stage at a meeting this week with Wall Street investors as the 
company, based in San Jose, California, plugged its proposed acquisition of television set-top box maker 
Scientific-Atlanta Inc. and the recent purchase of a small consumer-electronics maker. The deals also 
underscored Cisco's rising interest in the consumer marketplace, as gains in its flagship switching market slow. 
Mr. Chambers predicted the demands of video will transform the Internet over the next decade. Network traffic 
should rise fourfold to sixfold annually, instead of the 100%-a-year gains in the U.S. and Europe, he said. Beyond 
the heavy traffic is the technical challenge of moving video, Mr. Chambers said. "Making [video] work is really, 
really, really difficult." 
Scientific-Atlanta's products help Cisco expand its offerings by bringing it closer to the consumer market for 
movies and other videos. The set-top box becomes a valuable piece of real estate as video becomes more 
widespread, Mr. Chambers said. And it brings technology that Cisco is lacking. The company announced its bid 
last month and hopes to close the deal, valued at about $6.9 billion, early next year. 
Mr. Chambers also contends that the acquisition brings Cisco new opportunities abroad, where 
Scientific-Atlanta has less presence. Only 30% of spending on Internet-based television-broadcasting gear 
occurs in the U.S., he said. 
Cisco's recent $61 million purchase of Kiss Technology AS, a Danish consumer-electronics company, was in 
anticipation of a push into video like the one with Scientific-Atlanta. Kiss "may have been one of the most 
aggressive moves we made," said Mr. Chambers. 
Kiss makes an Internet-connected device for the European market that can play DVDs on television sets, play 
Internet radio and download weather reports, stock quotes and other video. Cisco says it is preparing to roll out 
new products for the European market from the acquisition. 
Next year, Kiss expects to enter the North American market with Internet-based products that play movies and 
television. 
"This will be a new expansion of our approach to networked entertainment," said Chris Stevens, a vice president 
at Cisco's Linksys home-networking division. Cisco is creating a Networked Entertainment Business unit around 
Kiss that will be formally announced next month along with the new Kiss products for European customers. 
Cisco says it expects to sell Kiss products through service providers -- such as the cable companies doing 
business with Scientific-Atlanta -- as well as in retail stores, where its Linksys PC-networking unit commands 
shelf space. 
Only 12% of digital cable set-top boxes have hard drives capable of recording programming, said 
market-research firm Forrester Research. By 2009, the number should be 50%.

Cisco hasn't yet detailed plans for Scientific-Atlanta and Kiss to jointly develop technology. Aaron Raker, an 
analyst at A.G. Edwards &Sons, doesn't expect significant integration between Scientific-Atlanta and any 
Linksys products in the next 12 months. Cisco isn't likely to risk disrupting the Scientific-Atlanta business, he 
says.

Cisco's purchase of TV box maker either bold or desperate 
NETWORKING-equipment giant Cisco Systems - with annual revenue of more than US$25 billion ($35 billion) 
and a market value of about US$108 billion - has had pockets deep enough to buy just about anyone it wanted to 
for the past decade or so, but it has deliberately shied away from the mega-deals that other companies have 
found so appealing (yes, we mean you, Nortel and JDS). 
That's not to say Cisco didn't blow its share of dough during the tech bubble, but in most cases it has focused on 
acquiring smaller companies that could be ``folded in'' to its existing operations. 
With that kind of backdrop, the recent announcement that Cisco was making a takeover bid for Scientific- 
Atlanta - a maker of TV set-top boxes - made many analysts and investors sit up and take notice. With a value of 
$6.9 billion, it is one of the largest deals the networking company has done in its history as a public company. 
For some, the sheer size of the acquisition raised an inevitable question: Was this a desperate bid for growth by a 
company whose growth is slowing or a smart move that could help to position Cisco for growth in a new market? 
There is plenty of evidence to support both arguments. On the optimistic side, many industry watchers believe the 
future of television is interactive and digital - digital meaning high-definition TV, but also other content such as 
internet services, photos and music, and interactive meaning two-way, with email and classifieds and photosharing 
and so on - all using the television as a platform. That future requires a sophisticated interface between 
the TV and the cable going into it, and that means a smart set-top box of the kind that a company such as 
Scientific-Atlanta is used to building. 
In fact, the company - the second- largest maker of set-top boxes, next to Motorola - already has its foot in the 
door of such advanced services, with a partnership involving AT&T, which used to be SBC. 
The telecom carrier, which is facing pressure from cable companies and voice-over-internet providers, wants to 
expand into digital entertainment and is testing a service called Lightspeed, which would use its fibre-optic 
network to provide cable- style entertainment as well as other digital and interactive services. 
Cisco supporters say this fits with its move into home networking (through its purchase of Linksys) and it could be 
the gatekeeper for IPTV (internet protocol television). 
So much for the optimistic case. The pessimists see the Scientific- Atlanta purchase as a simple grab for 
expansion from a company whose sheer size makes it difficult to produce the kind of double-digit growth it did in 
the past. 
What makes the deal even more of a stretch, they say, is that Scientific- Atlanta isn't even growing that quickly: 
7 per cent to 10 per cent a year, according to analysts. Although the IPTV and digital interactive services market 
could be a gigantic money- maker for the company, it remains only a potential future payoff rather than a reality, 
making it harder to buy Cisco's argument that it is worth spending $6.9 billion for the company. 
Cisco chief executive John Chambers sees Scientific-Atlanta becoming a key part of the company's 
``all-in-one'' solution for cable providers and telcos: a single system that combines the functions of a homenetwork 
router, a DSL or cable modem for internet access, and a set-top box with TV output, digital inputs and 
interactive capabilities - plus the gear required to make it all work at the ``head-end'', or network operations centre 
of the cable or telecom network. Whether telcos and cable operators will want to rely on a single company for all 
of those components remains to be seen, however. 
Then there's the question of partners. Microsoft, which has been pushing telcos and cable companies to adopt its 
IPTV software as part of their trials, has been working with Alcatel, which also makes modems and set-top boxes.

Page 9 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Cisco says it wants to convince Microsoft to work with it instead. If the two manage to set up a partnership, that 
could work well provided Microsoft's software manages to capture a big enough chunk of this new market. If 
telcos and cable companies choose to partner with others instead, such as Google or Yahoo, then Cisco could 
be left out in the cold. And in the meantime, it will be trying to serve the needs of three separate sets of conflicting 
customers: satellite providers, cable companies and telecom companies. 
In other words, Cisco's big bet has a lot of potential, but it is far from being a slam dunk. In fact, the company 
may have just bought itself $6.9 billion worth of headaches. Whether those headaches will eventually pay off is a 
question that investors in Cisco will have to answer for themselves.

Cisco Systems, a manufacturer of Internet infrastructure equipment, has announced a $6.9 billion deal to acquire 
Scientific-Atlanta, a cable set-top box manufacturer. 
John Chambers, Cisco’s president and CEO, said that the deal was stimulated by the fact that video is 
emerging as the key strategic application in service providers’ triple play bundle of consumer entertainment, 
communication and online services. The combined companies make it possible for Cisco to offer an end-to-end 
solution to address this trend. 
The boards of both companies have signed off on the deal. It is still subject to the approval of government 
antitrust regulators.

Cisco Systems is to acquire the set-top box and network technology provider Scientific-Atlanta in a deal that 
values the company at $6.9 billion. The transaction, which has already been approved by the boards of both 
companies, is expected to complete in the third quarter of Cisco's 2006 financial year. "Video is emerging as the 
key strategic application in the service provider triple play bundle of consumer entertainment, communication and 
online services," said John Chambers, president and chief executive officer of Cisco Systems. 
Scientific-Atlanta will form a part of Cisco's Routing and Service Provider Technology Group. Formed in 1951, 
Scientific-Atlanta went public eight years later. Comments on this story may be sent to

Cisco Gets Into the TV Picture; Internet Giant Buying Scientific-Atlanta for $6.9B

Scientific-Atlanta Inc., the second-largest supplier of set-top boxes in the cable industry, is selling itself to Cisco 
Systems Inc. for $6.9 billion in cash. With the acquisition, Cisco is signaling its intent to become a one-stop outlet 
for television, telephone and data networking equipment that use Internet communications. 
Adding S-A’s set-top box and transmission technologies will give Cisco the ability to supply broadband-network 
operators with devices it expects will simplify the back-and-forth transmission of video, voice and data services 
using Internet protocols. 
“This will reduce the complexity of merging video, voice and data over IP networks,” Cisco CEO John Chambers 
said. 
“Customers want integrated solutions,” said S-A chairman and CEO Jim McDonald, who will stay on for two years 
after the deal closes. 
S-A WAS ON THE RISE 
Cisco will pay S-A, founded in 1951, $43 in cash for each of its shares. That’s about a 4% premium over the 
54-year-old company’s share price of $41.45 on Thursday, the night before the deal was announced. 
S-A hit a 52-week high ($42.25) in afternoon trading Nov. 18, after the deal was announced. Cisco dipped to 
$16.99, down 38 cents. 
The acquisition of S-A and its 6,500 employees is expected to close in April. 
Cisco’s move into television devices comes after several years in which the company has moved aggressively to 
supply telephone companies with gear. S-A on Friday also talked up new prospects with telephone companies, 
such as SBC Communications Inc. 
S-A already supplies video gear to SBC, but McDonald said the box maker lost out on at least one big 
phone-company deal — he wouldn’t say which — because it was not able to offer a wider range of products. 
“If you look at the capital budgets of a couple of guys [in the telephone business], they’re almost as large as the 
whole cable industry by themselves,” McDonald said. “It’s a huge opportunity to supply these guys.” 
Oppenheimer & Co. equipment analyst Lawrence Harris said S-A has been eager to win seconda source 
contracts with Verizon Communications Inc., which buys equipment from rival Motorola Inc., and with BellSouth 
Corp. for video offerings. This deal, Harris said, is likely to improve S-A’s chances of attracting more of that 
business. 
In some ways, the deal mirrors Motorola’s purchase of General Instrument Corp. five years ago. Back then, 
cable’s other large set-top vendor was swallowed up by a company with a broad product line that was missing the 
in-home video piece. 
Cisco generated $1 billion in revenue from cable this year, largely from its routing and cable-modem termination 
system businesses. Also there: Cisco’s most recent cable-related acquisition, home-networking provider Linksys. 
McDonald will report to Cisco senior vice president Mike Volpi. 
CISCO KEEN ON VIDEO

“Video over a broadband infrastructure is becoming the centerpiece of the investment service providers are 
making,” said Volpi. “How to build video-enabled IP infrastructure is a critical asset. The S-A acquisition 
completes the quad-play offering for Cisco.” 
He said Cisco believes “video represents the biggest opportunity going forward.” 
“IPTV will take off,” Chambers said, fueling a video-equipment business expected to rise to $9.9 billion in 2009 
from $3.6 billion. 
S-A’s core product line consists of set-tops and related conditional-access and other gear for cable system 
headends. It has shipped 22 million digital set-tops, including 3.7 million digital video recorders and 2.6 million 
high-definition tuners. 
S-A is Time Warner Cable’s primary set-top supplier, and expects its share of Comcast’s business to grow to 14% 
from 7% after the two top cable companies absorb Adelphia Communications Corp.’s cable assets, S-A corporate 
senior vice president and president of subscriber networks Michael Harney said. 
Cisco is a major router and switch supplier to Comcast. The two companies also collectively count Cox 
Communications Inc., Cablevision Systems Corp., SBC and Verizon as major customers. 
Cisco also is a major supplier of gateways and soft switches for cable voice-over-Internet protocol telephone 
rollouts. Cisco also has sold 7 million IP phones, as large businesses also move to voice over IP services, Volpi 
said. Linksys is a key supplier of home-network and routing gear for consumers. 
UNIFIED IP PLATFORMS 
Both companies foresee broadband service providers merging separate voice, data and video on a single 
Internet-protocol platform, allowing services to merge onto similar devices. “Consumers want tightly coupled 
applications, networks and devices,” Volpi said. 
The major cable companies’ wireless initiative with Sprint Corp. — which will eventually bring cable video and 
high-speed data services to mobile phones — will be enabled by a common IP platform, he noted. Such a 
platform will let operators provide such applications as caller ID on the TV screen, programming a DVR from a 
cell phone and shifting music and pictures files among PCs and TVs. 
“Scientific-Atlanta has a portion of the solution and Cisco knows a great deal about networking and they’ve got 
Linksys,” Oppenheimer’s Harris said. “That’s where I do see some sort of capabilities emerging.” 
The sale of S-A is not a big surprise. The Lawrenceville, Ga., company began shopping itself in the spring, 
approaching French telecom equipment giant Alcatel and Cisco, Gartner Group analyst Patti Reali said in a 
report. 
Alcatel passed, but other potential suitors emerged, including Samsung Electronics Co., Sony Corp. and 
Panasonic Corp.

The world's largest maker of network gear on Friday said it would pay $6.9 billion in cash for Scientific-Atlanta, 
the No. 2 maker of cable set-top boxes behind Motorola. 
Increasingly, video to the home is going to be delivered in the same way the Internet gets delivered to computers 
-- and Cisco wants a big part of that gear business. 
Set-top boxes are a new field for Cisco, but some analysts say this is a good fit. Scientific-Atlanta will 
strengthen Cisco in growing areas of home networking, some say. 
"Video may be the most critical element in this bundle in ensuring consumer loyalty" for service providers, Cisco 
Chief Executive John Chambers told analysts in a conference call Friday. The deal "literally completes a large 
part of our quadruple play." 
The quadruple play refers to package deals of voice, data, wireless and video services that cable, telecom and 
satellite TV firms are pushing hard in a bid to retain and attract customers. 
For example, No. 2 U.S. phone carrier SBC Communications is spending $195 million to buy IPTV gear from 
Scientific-Atlanta in order to start offering pay-TV services. And SBC plans to use Scientific-Atlanta's set-top 
boxes. 
Cisco doesn't make much Internet protocol TV-specific gear. As a result, Cisco has lost market share to IPTV 
gear suppliers such as France's Alcatel. 
Getting Scientific-Atlanta's IPTV expertise gives Cisco instant cachet in that market, says Pacific Crest 
Securities analyst Tim Daubenspeck. 
"Cisco had to do something in IPTV," he said. "Now they have a decent chance to compete." 
The deal also gives Cisco a better position with cable operators. 
Two-thirds of Scientific-Atlanta's revenue comes from supplying set-top boxes to cable firms. Big customers 
include Time Warner Cable and Cablevision Systems. About 22 million U.S. homes use Scientific-Atlanta 
boxes. 
Increasingly, more subscribers are opting for digital cable service, which lets users get high-definition TV, 
personal video recorders and video on demand. At some point, set-top boxes will include more computerlike 
functionality, such as Web surfing, videoconferencing, e-mail and e-commerce. 
Chambers says digital set-top box expertise bolsters Cisco's efforts to sell more products for network home 
entertainment. With digital set-top boxes, consumers can share video among devices in different rooms of their 
house. 
Cisco's home networking unit, Linksys, makes products that send video throughout the house.

Linksys also stands to gain as cable operators prepare to offer mobile phone services. Comcast, Cox and Time 
Warner announced such a plan earlier this month, using Sprint Nextel'scellular network. 
Such a service will in part rely on Wi-Fi technology, which is a growing product area for Cisco. 
Daubenspeck says as cable firms deliver more services to homes, they'll become a key reseller of home 
networking gear. 
"The big play is for home networking," Daubenspeck said. "Cisco wants to make sure, whether the cable 
company supplies the box or someone else, that it has a major part in home networks."

Pushing into the consumer digital media market, business-to-business networking giant Cisco Systems has 
agreed to buy cable set-top box manufacturer Scientific-Atlanta for $6.9 billion. 
Scientific-Atlanta's clients in-clude Time Warner Cable and Adelphia Communications. 
Cisco, whose stock price closed down 2% on Friday at $17.02, plans to purchase Scientific-Atlanta at $43 per 
share, slightly higher than the firm's closing price of $42.15. 
In the past, Cisco's strategy was to acquire smaller businesses like the consumer hardware brand Linksys, 
whose products brought wireless networking to home and small-business users. Cisco purchased Linksys for 
$500 million in 2003. 
Dann Wilkens, vp at San Diego multimedia software company Packet Video, said the acquisition lands Cisco 
precisely where every media company is trying to be these days: in a world where four screens — TVs, PCs, 
phones and movies — collide. 
"The home distribution of multimedia content is a huge focus for cable, computer, wireless and game companies 
along with the traditional content companies," Wilkens said. "They all want to figure out the magic means for 
people to access, store and reuse all this digital content. Whoever owns the biggest network stands to gain, and 
Cisco just bought a huge network." 
The Scientific-Atlanta purchase also helps Cisco — traditionally a business-to-business brand — diversify its 
products to reach a wider consumer audience. 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple-play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication and online services," Cisco president and CEO John Chambers said. "The 
combination of Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta brings unmatched experience and innovation in delivering 
large-scale video systems and networks." 
Other tech companies have been grabbing for what they predict will be a slew of Internet TV dollars: Apple, 
Google and Yahoo! Inc. all launched video-search and broadcast products this year. 
When analysts recently began speculation about the sale of Scientific-Atlanta, the Lawrenceville, Ga.-based 
company's stock price started climbing. 
As of October, Scientific-Atlanta had shipped 3.8 million digital video recorders via cable operator partners. 
More recently, the company has won contracts to supply high-tech set-top boxes to the likes of SBC 
Communications, which along with other telecom firms is pushing into the video space, and Microsoft Corp., 
which is now launching Internet-based TV services. Cisco said it expects the deal to close during its fiscal third 
quarter. It is in its fiscal second quarter. 
Forrester Research analyst Josh Bernoff said Friday in a report that Cisco's move will heat up the competition in 
Scientific-Atlanta's space: "Cisco takes no prisoners," he said. "Look for a full-on assault — not just on U.S. 
telcos but on Motorola-based cable operators."

Cisco Systems will acquire Scientific-Atlanta, creating a triple play solution for carrier networks and the digital 
home. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Cisco will pay $43 per share in cash in exchange for each share of 
Scientific-Atlanta, and assume outstanding options, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $6.9 
billion, or approximately $5.3 billion net of Scientific-Atlanta's existing cash balance. 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication and online services," said John Chambers, president and chief executive officer 
of Cisco Systems. "The combination of Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta brings unmatched experience and 
innovation in delivering large scale video systems and networks, and the addition of Scientific-Atlanta further 
extends Cisco's commitment to and leadership in the service provider market. Moreover, Cisco's international 
presence and IP leadership will also create strategic synergies that accelerate the combined growth opportunity." 
Cisco Systems, Inc. is a leader in networking for the Internet. 
Scientific-Atlanta is a leading supplier of digital content distribution systems, transmission networks for 
broadband access to the home, digital interactive set-tops and subscriber systems designed for video, high-speed 
Internet and voice over IP (VoIP) networks, and worldwide customer service and support. 
The transaction will be accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the 
acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta is expected to close in the third quarter of Cisco's fiscal year 2006. Cisco 
anticipates this transaction will be neutral to its FY2006 earnings, slightly accretive to its non-GAAP (pro forma) 
FY2007 earnings, and will be financed with a combination of cash and debt. The acquisition has been approved 
by the board of directors of each company and is subject to various standard closing conditions, including 
approval under Hart Scott Rodino and similar laws outside the U.S. and by the shareholders of Scientific-Atlanta. 
Chambers continued, "As consumers demand more sophisticated information and entertainment services in their 
home, tightly coupled applications, devices and networks will be essential. The collective strength of Linksys and 
Scientific-Atlanta will extend Cisco's leadership position across the entire networked digital home." 
"We believe that this combination of Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta will benefit our shareholders, our customers 
and our employees," said Jim McDonald, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Scientific-Atlanta. 
"The combined strengths and resources of our two companies will position us to address more quickly the 
growing number of opportunities in the markets we serve and enable us to create new products and services that 
might not have existed otherwise." 
Scientific-Atlanta has platforms and technologies that enable scaling to millions of subscribers quickly and 
easily. This, along with the Cisco IP Next Generation Network architecture, will offer providers an open platform 
for service differentiation, allowing them to move beyond video/IPTV to develop and deliver a variety of integrated 
media services in the connected home. 
Following the close of the transaction, Scientific-Atlanta will become a division of the Routing and Service 
Provider Technology Group under the leadership of Cisco Senior Vice President Mike Volpi. Jim McDonald will 
report directly to Mr. Volpi. 
Prior to the close, Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta will operate as separate businesses and will continue to work 
with their existing partners. Following the close of the transaction, Cisco is committed to retaining the 
relationships and go-to-market strategies that both companies have developed.

November 18th Cisco Systems has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Scientific-Atlanta of Lawrenceville, 
Georgia, 
a. A global supplier of set-top boxes, end-to-end video distribution networks and video system integration, which 
was founded in 1951 and held its IPO in July 1959. 
b. Which employs more than 7,500 staff and for the 12 months ended July 1, 2005 reported revenues of $1.91 
billion. 
Cisco will pay around $43 per share or $6.9 billion gross or approximately $5.3 billion net of Scientific-Atlanta's 
existing cash balance of $1.6 billion. The transaction will be financed with a combination of cash and debt. 
The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of Cisco's fiscal year 2006 and Cisco anticipates the 
transaction will be neutral to its FY2006 earnings and slightly accretive to its non-GAAP (pro forma) FY2007 
earnings. 
Following the close of the transaction, Scientific-Atlanta is to become a division of Cisco' Routing and Service 
Provider Technology Group under the leadership of SVP Mike Volpi, with Scientific-Atlanta's current CEO Jim 
McDonald reporting directly to Mr. Volpi. 
Scientific-Atlanta supplies platforms and technologies that enable scaling to millions of subscribers quickly and 
easily which, when combined with the Cisco IP NGN architecture, is expected to offer providers an open platform 
for service differentiation, allowing them to move beyond video/IPTV to develop and deliver a variety of integrated 
media services in the connected home. 
Cisco CEO John Chambers was quoted as saying: 
- "Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication and online services". 
- "As consumers demand more sophisticated information and entertainment services in their home, tightly 
coupled applications, devices and networks will be essential". 
[Editorial Comment: With the $5.3 billion net acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta, Cisco's largest acquisition since a 
similar (but larger in real terms) price was paid for Cerent* in 1999, Cisco nominally gets its growth strategy back 
on track, adding sales of almost $2 billion per annum, or around 7.7% of 2004/5 sales of $24.8 billion, and adds 
another sector to its list of Advanced Technology** growth sectors.] [On the face of it this is a good expansionary 
move, which apart from its strategic impact, would, according to Cisco, be mildly accretive by 2007 and perhaps 
could in some circumstances have added 50 cents to a dollar to an already historically weak share price. Actually, 
it knocked 35 cents off the shares - driving the price to within 19 cents of its 52-week low and $1.12 per share 
below the $18.14 average price at which the company has repurchased 1.7 billion of its shares over the last two 
years.] [Judging by the reaction of the market to the announcement, the action seems to have resulted in the 
company having sacrificed quite a bit of managerial credibility. While it is impossible to define exactly why 
markets behave exactly the way they do, one can at least hypothesise that investors perceive the acquisition of 
Scientific-Atlanta firstly as confirmation, if confirmation were needed, that despite the company's systematic 
ingestion of brilliant cadres of engineers via its one-a-month mini-acquisitions, Cisco has largely lost the ability 
internally for revolutionary innovation†.] [Secondly, Cisco's management has persistently said that company 
policy was opposed to major acquisitions and now seems in part to have gone back on that philosophy. It is 
perhaps arguable that a business less than 10% of your own size is not exactly a major acquisition, but 
Scientific-Atlanta is certainly not small, and the addition of approximately 7,500 employees raises the Cisco

Page 23 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
workforce of around 38,000 by almost 20%. The acquisition is certainly by far the largest for six years, and a 
major change from the company's recent practice.] [On top of this, the timing of the entry into the IPTV sector is 
significantly late when the market is in full flow, and thronged with competitors of every kind (see robust 
comments by CEO of BigBand Networks).] [For that matter, Scientific-Atlanta's sales over the last 12 months 
have been rather flat, with the last six months lower than the preceding six months, and in particular sales for the 
quarter ended September 30, 2005 of $490 million down 7% sequentially, and also well short of market 
expectations of around $515 million.] [Investors might also wonder, given the absence of huge changes in either 
company recently, why, if as John Chambers claims this was one of the four most significant acquisitions†† 
Cisco has ever made, it had not been made a lot sooner.] [Looking at the other side of the acquisition, although 
Scientific-Atlanta shares rose only 70 cents to $42.15 or 1.69% on the day itself, they had already risen 25.6% 
over the last few weeks since a local low of $33.55 on October 12, 2005, at least partly on speculation about a 
deal.] [One supposedly major argument in favour of the acquisition is that Scientific-Atlanta, roughly 72.5% of 
whose business is done in the U.S. and only 27.5% internationally, will benefit from Cisco's international 
marketing network. That may well be, but is as yet a hypothesis and not a fact, and it is clear that the actual 
immediate net effect will be to increase the percentage of business done by Cisco domestically by a further 
couple of percentage points, reducing its international involvement by the same amount. This should be taken 
with the fact that between fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005, Cisco slightly increased the percentage of its business 
done in the Americas from 55.8% to 56.2%, and specifically lost share slightly in Asia-Pacific and over half a 
percentage point in Japan.] [So while some with a specifically U.S. perspective may have their clarity of vision 
obscured by the fact that Scientific-Atlanta is reckoned to be the second largest supplier of set-top boxes to U.S. 
CATV companies, with an estimated 40% market share, and in March 2005 received a contract from SBC 
Communications to design, build and activate IP video services for SBC's Project Lightspeed, a ruthlessly analytic 
view could argue that if anything the company would seem for the moment to be slowly but systematically sliding 
away from the international market.] [Even looking forward, given Scientific-Atlanta's current very low share of 
international markets, potentially many times the size of the U.S. market, and Cisco's lack of experience in the 
IPTV field, despite the usual brave noises made by CEO Chambers this is far from being a guaranteed winning 
global strategy, though it does make some of the immediate growth and market coverage numbers look good.] [At 
a more mundane level of detail related to the acquisition, Cisco management are said to have recently toured 
Scientific-Atlanta's Juarez plant in Mexico and reported as having decided to retain it, plus Jim McDonald and 
other key Scientific-Atlanta managers are reported as having agreed to stay with Cisco for at least two years. 
Cisco is also reported as having said it does not expect any job losses from the deal - which may seem a little 
surprising.] [* Not a particularly auspicious reference point since the benefits of that acquisition to date have been 
noticeable but by no means compelling.] [** According to Chambers' statement during a conference call, IPTV 
would now be the eighth such sector the other seven now being defined as digital home, optical, IP telephony, 
SAN, wireless, security and hosted small business. The naming of these strategic growth segments seems a 
fairly ethereal exercise given that:] [- Not much of the marketplace is left out and a strategy that includes pretty 
well everything is hardly in the normal sense a strategy, since the essence of a strategy is more definable by 
exclusion than inclusion.] [- As far as we know, there has been no publicly issued detail of what is included in 
these sectors (many of which inevitably overlap with each other), adding further to the rather abstract nature of 
the exercise.] [- Although Cisco has identified that to qualify, each of these sectors must be able to contribute at 
least $1 billion to the company's top line, as far as we know, no date limit has been set on that objective, which 
would seem to make a nonsense of it target-wise.] [- Cisco does not publish any measures of performance for 
these sectors and no detail is provided of what goes into the company's Advanced Technology shipments, so it is 
impossible for anyone outside the company (more than likely anyone inside the company as well) to determine, at 
least sector by sector, whether the company is succeeding or not.] [† This is a complex issue, and neither by 
training nor in terms of the amount of time that OND can devote to the analysis, are we particularly well-equipped 
to be critical on this issue, which apart from anything else would require good knowledge of what is currently 
being developed by Cisco internally. The impression given is not merely that the company has ceased to be 
capable of serious innovation, but that it has actually given up on the idea. At first sight, there is certainly 
something to be said for a strategy that concentrates internally on evolutionary engineering and buys in the 
revolutionary bits, since it is at least a clear and moderately plausible strategy. The flaws in this approach seem to 
be the following two theoretical arguments and one practical one:] [- It is arguable that any business with a truly 
revolutionary product line would never want to sell out to a company like Cisco and could always get better 
funding arrangements elsewhere; ergo Cisco acquisitions are bound to be good, but not great, products.] [- It is 
hard enough to pick winners at the best of times and it is questionable whether a company that has largely 
become sceptical of its own ability to innovate is able to accurately judge the innovations of others (early enough 
to be useful - we are all wise after the event of course; deciding something is an innovation when everyone 
agrees with you just misses the point).] [- So far this approach does not actually seem to have worked for Cisco.] 
[†† A further example of Cisco managerial gabble; given the absolute size of the acquisition it could hardly fail to 
be at the top of anybody's list of top acquisitions for the company over the last few years, otherwise the company

would have just wasted a large amount of money. So as usual Chambers managed to say what appears to be an 
important statement without actually saying anything meaningful at all.]

Cisco's vision of the digital home given clarity by SA deal - The takeover of Scientific-Atlanta may give

When Cisco Systems, the world's biggest maker of internet networking equipment, last week announced a 
Dollars 6.9bn deal to take over Scientific-Atlanta, the second-biggest maker of set-top cable television boxes, 
many industry watchers proclaimed it a savvy move. 
Scientific-Atlanta commands a substantial portion of the market in boxes that decode cable transmissions and 
display them on television screens - a foothold analysts say could give Cisco an advantage in the coming battle 
for the digital home. 
As the lines between traditional video, telephone and data services continue to blur, cable providers, telecoms 
groups, and consumer electronics makers are racing to cash in by bundling these three services into a lucrative 
"triple play". 
"Video is the killer app of triple play, and (wireless) mobility is the killer app of quadruple play," says Michael 
Howard, principal analyst at Infonetics Research, a telecoms and networking consultancy. "Cisco now has both." 
Demand for integration of video, telephone, and data across a single home network is poised to lead a new wave 
of growth in data services, as increasing numbers of households connect to the internet via faster broadband 
connections. 
"The consumer already uses all of these services," says Ned Hooper, Cisco's senior director of corporate 
business development. "The next thing he wants is tosee them integrated." The acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta 
could help Cisco chief executive John Chambers' push into the digital home in two ways. 
The first is the presence it will have, thanks to SA, in the "back-end" networks of cable companies - as well as the 
new internet protocol television networks of telecoms companies - which are experimenting with supplying their 
own video services, where Cisco hopes to sell more of SA's gear. Cisco will be able to draw on storage and 
processing power at various parts of the network, not just in the box in the customer's home, to design the most 
effective way of delivering services. 
The other is through the combination of Scientific-Atlanta's set-top boxes with Cisco's Linksys wireless 
networking tools. "Today most people have a single (digital video recorder box), but they have an average of 2.5 
televisions per home, says Mr Hooper. "With a Linksys home network connected to a Scientific-Atlanta set-top 
box, you can move that view around the home to whatever device you want." 
Because of its high bandwidth requirements, video has long been viewed as the "killer app" of integrated home 
networks. There are good reasons to believe that set-top boxes could emerge as the preferred hub for such 
systems. 
Because cable and satellite companies in most countries buy the boxes and recoup the cost through the monthly 
fees paid by subscribers, set-top boxes have a guaranteed route into the home, says Michael Greeson, CEO of 
The Diffusion Group, a US research and consulting firm.

Although their original purpose was to provide the "conditional access" needed to manage a pay-TV service, 
set-top boxes have been evolving into broader consumer devices. Scientific-Atlanta's Media Center DVR 
includes a digital video recorder, DVD player and burner. That is a close echo of Microsoft's Media Center PC, a 
version of the Windows software that is meant to power PCs with many of the same features. 
The market for these more versatile digital boxes remains in its infancy: after a slow start, 6m Media Center PCs 
have so far been sold, while Scientific-Atlanta has sold 3.7m set-top boxes with built-in DVR capability. 
The acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta will propel Cisco into competition with Microsoft, Motorola and a range of 
consumer electronics companies that have their own visions of how consumers should access, store and manage 
digital media.

Scientific-Atlanta commands a substantial portion of the market in boxes that decode cable transmissions and 
display them on television screens - a foothold analysts say could give Cisco an advantage in the coming battle 
for the digital home. 
As the lines between traditional video, telephone and data services continue to blur, cable providers, telecoms 
groups, and consumer electronics makers are racing to cash in by bundling these three services into a lucrative 
"triple play". 
"Video is the killer app of triple play, and [wireless] mobility is the killer app of quadruple play," says Michael 
Howard, principal analyst at Infonetics Research, a telecoms and networking consultancy. "Cisco now has both." 
Demand for integration of video, telephone, and data across a single home network is poised to lead a new wave 
of growth in data services, as increasing numbers of households connect to the internet via faster broadband 
connections. 
"The consumer already uses all of these services," says Ned Hooper, Cisco's senior director of corporate 
business development. "The next thing he wants is tosee them integrated." The acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta 
could help Cisco chief executive John Chambers' push into the digital home in two ways. 
The first is the presence it will have, thanks to SA, in the "back-end" networks of cable companies - as well as the 
new internet protocol television networks of telecoms companies - which are experimenting with supplying their 
own video services, where Cisco hopes to sell more of SA's gear. Cisco will be able to draw on storage and 
processing power at various parts of the network, not just in the box in the customer's home, to design the most 
effective way of delivering services. 
The other is through the combination of Scientific-Atlanta's set-top boxes with Cisco's Linksys wireless 
networking tools. "Today most people have a single [digital video recorder box], but they have an average of 2.5 
televisions per home, says Mr Hooper. "With a Linksys home network connected to a Scientific-Atlanta set-top 
box, you can move that view around the home to whatever device you want." 
Because of its high bandwidth requirements, video has long been viewed as the "killer app" of integrated home 
networks. There are good reasons to believe that set-top boxes could emerge as the preferred hub for such 
systems. 
Since cable and satellite companies in most countries buy the boxes and recoup the cost through the monthly 
fees paid by subscribers, set-top boxes have a guaranteed route into the home, says Michael Greeson, CEO of 
The Diffusion Group, a US research and consulting firm. 
Although their original purpose was to provide the "conditional access" needed to manage a pay-TV service, 
set-top boxes have been evolving into broader consumer devices. Scientific-Atlanta's Media Center DVR 
includes a digital video recorder, DVD player and burner. That is a close echo of Microsoft's Media Center PC, a 
version of the Windows software that is meant to power PCs with many of the same features. 
The market for these more versatile digital boxes remains in its infancy: after a slow start, 6m Med Center PCs 
have so far been sold, while Scientific-Atlanta has sold 3.7m set-top boxes with built-in DVR capability.

The acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta will propel Cisco into competition with Microsoft, Motorola and a range of 
consumer electronics companies that have their own visions of how consumers should access, store and manage 
digital media.

CISCO Systems Inc will buy cable television set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta Inc for $US6.9 billion ($9.4 
billion), moving the Internet equipment giant into the home entertainment market. 
The world's largest maker of products that direct Internet traffic, Cisco with this move vaults into the battle among 
cable, satellite and telecommunications companies to be a one-stop shop for telephone, video and Internet 
services. 
Cable TV set-top boxes could become the primary conduit for consumers to receive video programming, ranging 
from television and on-demand movies to video games and Internet content. 
"The infrastructure of the future must allow consumers to personalise data, voice and video," Cisco chief 
executive John Chambers said. 
Scientific-Atlanta is the maker of the TV set-top boxes that convert signals for cable and satellite programming. 
Points North Group analyst Stewart Wolpin said the set-top box eventually could allow people to get their 
programming through an Internet search and then watch it on television. 
"It's like (having) re-runs available on Google or Yahoo, so if I want to see episode 32 of The Man From 
U.N.C.L.E., this is going to enable that kind of searching and accessing at the television," Mr Wolpin said. 
The deal could intensify competition with set-top box makers such as Motorola Inc. It could could allow Cisco to 
expand its business beyond its business routers and switches, the network tools that route data on the Internet. 
Cisco is valued at more than $US112 billion, but investors see it as a slow-growth company because of its 
reliance on its slowing router and switch business for the bulk of its sales. 
The company has pinpointed technology areas it thinks could jump-start its growth, including a previous foray into 
consumer technology with its Linksys home networking product. 
"Cisco is starting to identify the next phase of its growth, and it could conceivably help," Sanford Bernstein 
analyst Paul Sagawa said of the Scientific-Atlanta deal. 
"Investors had started to show concern it lacked that something for the next phase of its growth."

Review & Preview Follow-Up -- A Return Visit to Earlier Stories: Cisco Deal Leaves Street Cold

John Chambers, the street isn't happy with you. This has been a rough year for Cisco Systems' (ticker: CSCO) 
gentlemanly CEO. The networking-equipment giant's shares are off 12%, and it sits just one ugly trading day 
away from falling below $100 billion in market value. There's concern that Cisco's core growth is slowing, despite 
its forays into new markets like storage, voice over Internet telephony and security; and there's grumbling about 
its refusal to use its cash to pay a dividend or make a big share buyback. 
Friday, the concerns deepened, after Cisco cut a $6.9 billion, or $43 a-share, deal for cable-TV equipment giant 
Scientific-Atlanta. This gives it control of half the U.S. cable set-top box duopoly, along with Motorola (MOT). As 
Barron's has noted several times, including in cover stories this year on the digital living room (March 7) and 
HDTV (May 23), Scientific-Atlanta is well-positioned in the expanding digital home-entertainment market. 
Increasingly, cable and telecom outfits are offering a "quadruple play" -- video, broadband Internet access, voice 
and wireless services. Combining Scientific-Atlanta's video technology with the wireless networking capability of 
Cisco's Linksys unit could create compelling new home-networking products. Crows Ned Hooper, Cisco's vice 
president for corporate business development: "We'll be able to offer a package no one can duplicate." 
However, Wall Street finds the economics troubling. Cisco shares slid 2% Friday, to 17.02. Cisco asserts that the 
deal will be neutral to earnings in fiscal 2006, and slightly accretive in '07. However, Scientific-Atlanta is a 
relatively slow grower; revenues are rising about 10%-12% a year. 
In a conference call Friday, Chambers asserted that synergies with existing Cisco products can boost 
Scientific-Atlanta's growth into the 12% to 16% range. That would be a little better than the 10% expected for 
the rest of Cisco, but it would come with lower margins. And, while the $43 price is only a 3.7% premium to 
Thursday's close, it's about 28% above where the stock was trading before rumors of a deal started in late 
October. 
Jeffrey Evenson, an analyst with Bernstein Research, who rates Cisco a Market Performer, worries about 
whether it can maintain SA's proprietary hold on "conditional access," the cable-infrastructure technology that 
requires you to get your set-top box from your service provider and prevents you from buying a cheap knock-off 
from a retailer. Regulators have been pushing for an open standard. But Bob McIntyre, Scientific-Atlanta's chief 
technical officer, contends that technical issues could delay this for several years. 
Nikos Theodosopolous, UBS' networking analyst, thinks the linkup helps both companies. But he's still neutral on 
Cisco, concluding that it's fairly priced at 17 and that, even with Scientific Atlanta, its growth prospects have 
slowed, and that its margins will be difficult to sustain.

Cisco Systems Inc. has filled in the missing element -- video -- from its far-reaching effort to penetrate the 
consumer market. 
The networking giant's $6.9 billion deal to buy Scientific-Atlanta Inc., confirmed by the companies Friday, gives 
Cisco a line of widely used TV set-top boxes as well as server systems used by cable operators to distribute 
programming. The technology and customer relationships could help Cisco sell products to carriers developing 
"quadruple play" services, a term for offerings that encompass voice, video, Internet and wireless, the companies 
said. 
Initial targets will include U.S. cable operators that are planning to upgrade their services with new set-top boxes, 
as well as phone companies around the world that are rapidly adding video services. Over the longer term, the 
companies hope to help usher in new, personalized entertainment services, such as letting users view sporting 
events from different camera angles and chat with viewers in other locations. 
"It's both a consumer play and a service-provider play, and a growth opportunity outside the U.S., where 
Scientific-Atlanta did not have as strong a presence," said John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, in an 
interview. 
Cisco, of San Jose, California, mainly sells its networking devices to corporations and phone carriers. But the 
company also sells hardware that cable companies use to provide Internet access. In addition, it sells products 
such as wireless-access devices directly to consumers, since its 2003 acquisition of Linksys Group Inc. 
Those technologies, combined with Scientific-Atlanta's expertise, could help Cisco exploit the conversion of 
video into the format used on the Internet. That evolution can make today's cable systems more efficient, as well 
as bypass such video-only networks to allow the delivery of programming over the Internet, an approach 
sometimes called IPTV. 
The two companies, for example, could add features such as DVD recording and wireless networking to new 
set-top boxes, and market them either to carriers or directly to consumers. The latter possibility, which assumes 
the availability of attractive programming over the Internet, could be viewed as a threat by carriers hoping to keep 
selling lucrative services to their customers. 
"There is going to be a little bit of a battle about who is really going to capture this value," said James McDonald, 
Scientific-Atlanta's CEO. 
Rick Doherty, an analyst at the market-research firm Envisioneering Group, called the deal "a tremendous win" 
that gives Cisco new influence in negotiating with media companies about new services. It also could raise 
complications for Microsoft Corp.'s efforts to set standards in digital television, he argued, as well as turn 
Scientific-Atlanta into a more potent competitor to Motorola Inc., the No. 1 maker of set-top boxes. 
Risks of the deal, analysts said, include the challenges of integrating Scientific-Atlanta's large organization, 
which is based in Lawrenceville, Georgia. Cisco has historically preferred much smaller deals with companies 
closer to its Silicon Valley headquarters. 
While Scientific-Atlanta will be largely operated independently, the two technical teams will work closely 
together, the companies said. Mr. McDonald has agreed to stay with the combined companies for two years.

Cisco agreed to pay $43 a share for Scientific-Atlanta, whose shares rose 70 cents to $42.15 in 4 p.m. 
composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. Cisco's shares fell 2% to $17.02 on Nasdaq.

NETWORKING giant Cisco Systems will buy cable set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta for $US6.9 billion ($9.4 
billion) in a sign of convergence in telecoms and television. 
Cisco on Friday offered $US43 a share for Scientific-Atlanta, a premium over the Thursday close of $US41.45. 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider's triple-play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication and online services," said John Chambers, president and chief executive officer 
of Cisco Systems, based in San Jose, California. 
"As consumers demand more sophisticated information and entertainment services in their home, tightly coupled 
applications, devices and networks will be essential. The collective strength of (Cisco's home network division) 
Linksys and Scientific-Atlanta will extend Cisco's leadership position across the entire networked digital home." 
Scientific-Atlanta, a company created in 1951, is a major supplier of set-top boxes used by cable providers. 
These systems have become more sophisticated as providers move to digital interactive programs, video 
on-demand, high-speed internet and voice-over-internet networks. Cisco Systems is the No1 provider of 
networking systems for the internet. 
"Telecoms continues to change," said telecom analyst Jeff Kagan. "As phone companies and cable-TV 
companies compete, it's about the broadband line and all the services they can deliver to customers in all the 
different ways." 
Mr Kagan said Scientific-Atlanta "has been a company focused on the cable-TV space, but those set-top boxes 
are evolving and getting into phone and internet and all the other advanced features the companies will need to 
compete with each other".

Cisco pays $6.9bn to access your living room

BY acquiring US-based television technology company Scientific-Atlanta for about $6.9bn (£4bn, E5.9bn), 
networking giant Cisco Systems hopes to firmly establish itself in the world’s living rooms. 
Although Cisco is a market leader in its core business of providing telecoms and internet networking technology, 
president and chief executive John Chambers has been concerned that the company was in danger of falling 
behind in the race to capture the internet television consumer market. 
Chambers is convinced video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider bundle of 
consumer entertainment, communication and online services. He believes the merger of Cisco with television 
set-top box maker Scientific Atlanta will enable innovation in delivering large-scale video systems and networks. 
The merger is part of a tidal wave of takeovers taking place as the telecoms, internet and home entertainment 
sectors converge to deliver all types of video and entertainment into the living room via the internet. By combining 
telecoms, the internet and entertainment in the home, the big players hope to steal each other’s market share 
while creating new consumer services combining the entertainment value of the television with the search 
capabilities of the world wide web. 
According to Chambers, the merger of the two companies will spawn new products and services that will move 
beyond video and internet TV. 
Another element in Cisco’s strategy to take over the living room was its acquisition of wireless internet (wi-fi) 
technology company Linksys two years ago. Linksys provides the expertise needed to network electronic 
products in the home – without the need for metres of cabling – using wi-fi base station boxes. 
Scientific Atlanta will become a division of Cisco’s routing and service provider technology group under Cisco 
senior vice president Mike Volpi. Under the terms of the deal, Cisco will pay $43 a share in cash in exchange for 
each share of Scientific-Atlanta, and assume outstanding options, for a total purchase price of about $6.9bn. 
Cisco says the transaction will be neutral to its full-year earnings and will be financed with a combination of cash 
and debt. 
Scientific-Atlanta said last month that its first-quarter profit grew 9% to $60.7m, although sales of $490m were 
below Wall Street analysts’ expectations. Earlier this month, Cisco’s first-quarter profit slipped as the company 
expensed employee stock options for the first time and the company predicted weaker-than-expected sales.

NEW YORK -- Pushing into the consumer digital media market, business-to-business networking giant <u>Cisco 
Systems</u> said that it agreed to buy cable set-top box manufacturer Scientific-Atlanta for $6.9 billion. 
Scientific-Atlanta's clients include Time Warner Cable and Adelphia Communications. 
Cisco, whose stock price closed down 2% on Friday at $17.02, plans to purchase Scientific-Atlanta at $43 per 
share, slightly higher than the firm's closing price of $42.15. 
In the past, Cisco's strategy was to acquire smaller businesses like the consumer hardware brand Linksys, 
whose products brought wireless networking to home and small business users. Cisco purchased Linksys for 
$500 million in 2003. 
Dann Wilkens, vp at San Diego multimedia software company Packet Video, said the acquisition lands Cisco 
precisely where every media company is trying to be these days: in a world where four screens -- TVs, PCs, 
phones and movies -- collide. 
"The home distribution of multimedia content is a huge focus for cable, computer, wireless and game companies 
along with the traditional content companies," Wilkens said. "They all want to figure out the magic means for 
people to access, store and reuse all this digital content. Whoever owns the biggest network stands to gain, and 
Cisco just bought a huge network." 
The Scientific-Atlanta purchase also helps Cisco -- traditionally a business-to-business brand -- diversify its 
products to reach a wider consumer audience. 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple-play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication and online services," Cisco president and CEO John Chambers said. "The 
combination of Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta brings unmatched experience and innovation in delivering 
large-scale video systems and networks." 
Other tech companies have been grabbing for what they predict will be a slew of Internet TV dollars: Apple, 
Google and Yahoo! Inc. all launched video-search and broadcast products this year. 
When analysts recently began speculation about the sale of Scientific-Atlanta, the Lawrenceville, Ga.-based 
company's stock price started climbing. 
As of October, Scientific-Atlanta had shipped 3.8 million digital video recorders via cable operator partners. 
More recently, the company has won contracts to supply high-tech set-top boxes to the likes of SBC 
Communications, which along with other telecom firms is pushing into the video space, and Microsoft Corp., 
which is now launching Internet-based TV services. 
Cisco said it expects the deal to close during its fiscal third quarter. It is in its fiscal second quarter. 
Forrester Research analyst Josh Bernoff said Friday in a report that Cisco's move will heat up the competition in 
Scientific-Atlanta's space: "Cisco takes no prisoners," he said. "Look for a full-on assault -- not just on U.S. 
telcos but on Motorola-based cable operators."

Cisco buys TV gear maker with view to home market

In one of the larger acquisitions in its 21-year history, Cisco Systems Inc. agreed yesterday to buy TV gear maker 
Scientific-Atlanta Inc. for $6.9-billion (U.S.), a deal that will expand the Internet equipment giant's video business 
and further propel it beyond offices into homes. 
The purchase fits with Cisco's strategy over the past few years of broadening its traditional corporate client base 
by selling gear to telephone and cable companies. As these clients rush to offer telephone, Internet, television, 
and even wireless services, San Jose, Calif.-based Cisco needs to keep pace. 
“Cisco's goal is to own all networks everywhere,” said CIBC World Markets analyst Steve Kamman. “As people 
build their networks at home, Cisco wants to own them.” 
With Scientific-Atlanta, Cisco adds video distribution networks, along with set-top boxes for cable TV, which 
some observers say could be a key gateway for communication services to the home. Cisco will compete with 
Motorola in this area. 
The purchase “literally completes a large part of our quadruple play as data, voice, video and mobility converge,” 
Cisco chief executive officer John Chambers said yesterday on a conference call. 
He added later that “video is emerging as a key element in the service provider quadruple-play bundle.” 
Changes in the communications industry are being driven by Internet protocol technology, which allows voice and 
data to be sent together instead of on separate networks. It is leading to a turf war between cable and phone 
companies as their services overlap, opening up new equipment selling opportunities. 
“Telco spending on video is really exploding,” Mr. Kamman said. 
Cisco “is not buying a fixer-upper,” he later added. “They are buying a quality asset and then trying to grow it in 
new areas.” 
Mr. Kamman said Cisco's challenge will be to expand Scientific-Atlanta's presence outside of the United States 
and among phone-service providers. It also needs to sell bundled packages of Scientific-Atlanta and Cisco 
gear. 
“We won't be able to judge whether or not they're succeeding in that for a year or two,” he said. 
The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Cisco says. It will have no effect on 2006 
profit, and will add slightly to pro forma 2007 earnings. 
For Cisco, the purchase of Scientific-Atlanta, based in Lawrenceville, Ga., is a shift away from its usual practice 
of snapping up small firms. Among the company's 10 other acquisitions this year, the majority were under 
$100-million. 
Cisco is paying $43 a share in cash for each share of Scientific-Atlanta, a 3.7-per-cent premium to Thursday's 
closing price. The boards of both companies have approved the transaction, which requires regulatory approval.

While shares of Scientific-Atlanta rose 70 cents to $42.15 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Cisco's 
stock slipped 35 cents to $17.02 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Some believe the acquisition is too expensive, arguing the synergies will be “negligible” and that there isn't a lot of 
growth ahead for set-top boxes, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Jeff Evenson. However, he 
believes Cisco will be able to tap into synergies and new revenue opportunities. 
“This acquisition creates a lot of technology and strategic head room for Cisco that I believe they'll be able to 
execute sufficiently well to exploit,” Mr. Evenson said.

Cisco Systems, the world's biggest maker of internet routing and switching equipment, yesterday moved to sieze 
control of the digital home with a Dollars 6.9bn deal to buy Scientific-Atlanta, a US maker of cable television 
boxes. 
The all-cash deal would set the stage for Cisco to offer a platform that combines digital video, telephone, data 
and wireless services across a single network inside the home. Demand for such services is expected to drive a 
new wave of growth in data services as increasing numbers of households connect to the internet via faster 
broadband connections. 
"Video is emerging as a key element," said John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive. "The opportunity for Cisco 
is to dramatically reduce the complexity of converging data, voice and video over IP in both a fixed and mobile 
environment." 
Ragu Gurumurthy, analyst at Adventis, a telecoms and digital media consultancy, said the deal would be 
"phenomenal" for Cisco, which has been struggling to meet growth targets amid flagging sales of its core routing 
and switching equipment. 
"(Cisco's) penetration of the service provider market over the last five years has been mediocre at best," said Mr 
Gurumurthy. "This is the right move for them." 
However, one analyst ex-pressed concern that Cisco's offer price could leave the deal open to rival bids. Ehud 
Gelblum, at JPMorgan, said in a research note that Scientific-Atlanta's sale priceof Dollars 43 per share - a 3.7 
per cent premium over Thursday's closing price - was "much too low". 
"At this price point we would expect other bidders to be interested and surface, including large consumer 
electronic companies, telecom equipment vendors and large software players interested in home media 
entertainment," Mr Gelblum wrote. One such company could be Motorola, Scientific-Atlanta's chief rival in the 
set-top cable box market. 
Scientific-Atlanta is the second-largest maker of set-top boxes that allow consumers to digitally record TV 
broadcasts for viewing at their chosen time. 
Cisco said it expected the deal to close in the third quarter of 2006. It said is was not likely to have an impact on 
earnings for that fiscal year. The deal will be financed through a combination of cash and debt. 
Shares in Scientific-Atlanta rose 1.7 per cent to Dollars 42.14 on news of the deal. Cisco's shares fell 2.2 per 
cent to Dollars 16.99.

CISCO Systems, the US giant which supplies network management for internet, is close to buying a television 
set-top box maker for nearly $7billion ( pounds 4billion), US newspapers have reported. 
The deal to buy US company Scientific-Atlanta - Cisco's largest to date - will take the internet equipment giant 
into the home entertainment market and could create a one-stop shop for telephone, video and internet services 
equipment. 
The final price is expected to be around $5.3billion as Cisco expects to acquire a cash balance of about 
$1.7billion from Scientific-Atlanta. 
Cisco will now be closer to the cable, satellite and telecommunications companies that are trying to combine the 
provision of telephone, video and internet services to consumers. 
Josh Bernoff, an analyst at Forrester Research, said: "We think this going to make some real changes in the 
industry.'' 
For Cisco the deal signals a new opportunity for the firm to grow its business beyond its design of routers and 
switches, the network tools that route data on the internet. It will gain access to Scientific's chief asset - the 
set-top box that converts the signals for cable and satellite programming - and is likely to increase competition 
with other set-top box makers such as Motorola Inc. 
Commenting on the announcement, John Chambers, chief executive, said "Video is emerging as the key 
strategic application in the service provider triple-play bundle of consumer entertainment, communication and 
online services. As consumers demand more sophisticated information and entertainment services in their home, 
tightly coupled applications, devices and networks will be essential.'' 
The price Cisco is paying for Scientific-Atlanta is a 3.7pc premium over its closing price on Thursday. News of 
the deal sent Cisco's shares down 2.25 pc.

SAN JOSE, Calif. 
Cisco Systems Inc. agreed Friday to acquire TV set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta Inc. for about $6.9 billion 
US in a move that would create a one-stop shop -- and a market leader -- in distributing television to living rooms 
over the Internet. 
The deal, Cisco's largest in terms of revenue and headcount, capitalizes on a business that's expected to 
explode as telephone companies deploy fibre-based networks capable of carrying TV signals and broadcasters 
shift to digital transmissions. 
It fits into Cisco's strategy of expanding into areas that are moving toward standards on the language of the 
Internet -- a transition that creates an opportunity to grow revenue with new business and enhance its traditional 
routers and switches that direct data over networks. 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication and online services," said John Chambers, Cisco's CEO. 
"The addition of Scientific-Atlanta further extends Cisco's commitment to and leadership in the service-provider 
market." 
For Scientific-Atlanta, the deal is expected to bring more capital and fuel its expansion beyond cable TV 
companies that have been slow to introduce new technologies to customers, said Josh Bernoff, an analyst at 
Forrester Research. 
"Cisco has struggled to succeed both with telephone and cable companies. Scientific-Atlanta is sort of in a 
position where innovation and capital push would be helpful for them," he said. "We think this is going to make 
some real changes in the industry." 
Cisco is paying $43 a share for Scientific-Atlanta, which competes primarily against Motorola Inc. in making 
set-top boxes for television programs and movies-on-demand. That is a 3.7 per cent premium over its closing 
price Thursday. 
Scientific-Atlanta shares rose 70 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to close at $42.15 in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, while Cisco shares slipped 35 cents to $17.02 on the Nasdaq stock market. 
Cisco said Scientific-Atlanta will become a division of its routing and service provider technology group, led by 
Cisco senior vice-president Mike Volpi. It also identified it as the eighth of its "advanced technologies," which 
means it expects the business to generate more than a billion dollars in revenue within five to seven years. 
Jim McDonald, Scientific-Atlanta's CEO, said the deal arose in part because customers are now expecting 
bundled services. 
"These customers want more complete, integrated solutions from fewer vendors," said McDonald, who said he 
will remain with the company for two years.

The deal, which was approved by the boards of both companies, is expected to close in the third quarter of 
Cisco's fiscal 2006 calendar, pending closing conditions. 
San Jose-based Cisco said it expects the deal to be neutral to its fiscal 2006 earnings, while slightly boosting its 
fiscal 2007 profit before items. Cisco said it will finance the transaction with cash and debt. 
Analysts expect Cisco to earn $1.03 per share for fiscal 2006, and $1.18 per share for fiscal 2007, according to a 
Thomson Financial survey.

Los Angeles --- Ask folks outside Silicon Valley or other technology hubs what they know about Cisco Systems 
Inc., and they may say something about ketchup or mustard. 
"My mother still thinks I'm working for the food service industry," Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers joked a 
few years ago, when his company was regularly confused with Sysco Corp., the Houston-based restaurant 
supplier. 
Cisco's meteoric rise on Wall Street in recent years to become one of the biggest publicly traded companies in 
the world has helped its identity crisis. 
But since San Jose, Calif.-based Cisco's primary business is making the behind-the-scenes equipment that 
keeps the Internet and corporate networks running, it hasn't had much of a direct connection with consumers. 
That's about to change. 
Cisco's purchase of Scientific-Atlanta will put it directly in the living rooms of about 50 million consumers around 
the globe. 
It also will help complete Cisco's transformation into a one-stop shop for equipment used at just about every part 
of the Internet communications backbone. That includes devices that carry digital data from server computers to 
telephone and cable lines, neighborhood switches that route the signals to homes, and now the cable boxes atop 
television sets. 
"When you look at Cisco's network and backbone solutions and Scientific-Atlanta's strength at the [cable] 
head-end and [set-top box], it's really a good combination," said Kurt Scherf, an analyst at Dallas-based 
technology research company Parks Associates. "It really speaks to where the communications and 
entertainment services business are going." 
Hard to sort out 
Figuring out the communications world right now is about as confusing as trying to figure out the basketful of 
remote controls for your home entertainment components. 
Cable TV companies are pushing into telephone and Internet service. Telephone companies are getting into the 
TV programming business. Internet companies seem to be probing into everything. 
With its $6.9 billion purchase of Scientific-Atlanta, Cisco is betting --- like many others --- that delivery of video 
and other data over set-top boxes is going to be a crucial part of tomorrow's communications landscape. 
"Today the set-top box is something that allows a customer to hit the channel changer and watch TV, and that's 
about it," said Jeff Kagan, an independent technology consultant in Atlanta. 
"Tomorrow, that same box is going to blend television, telephone and high-speed Internet service to give 
customers experiences they don't have today," he said. "That's the future that Cisco wants to be a bigger part of."

Page 45 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
While the move is one of Cisco's most pronounced forays into the consumer side of technology, it's not the only 
one. 
Buyout in 2003 
In 2003, Cisco bought Linksys, the maker of broadband Internet routers and hubs that are common in home 
networks and Internet telephone hookups. 
In a conference call with reporters and analysts Friday, CEO Chambers said the deal will let Cisco pioneer new 
ways to meld Internet networks with cable networks, using its Linksys and Scientific-Atlanta equipment. 
The set-top boxes of the future, Chambers predicted, will be hubs for Internet, video and telephony, as well as 
wireless routers to distribute all of it throughout a home. For cable and telephone companies, the combination 
could allow them to deliver upgrades and new services to customers more quickly, he said. 
"We will now have a more complete portfolio for the digital home ... [that] provides Cisco with a unique 
differentiation in the consumer product market segment," Chambers said. 
Cisco isn't a newcomer to the cable business. It currently provides telephone and data distribution equipment and 
software to the industry, among other things. 
Still, Cisco gets only about 4 percent of its sales from consumer goods --- mainly its Linksys equipment --- and 
only 25 percent from consumer service providers such as cable companies. The biggest part of Cisco's business 
remains selling routers, switches and other equipment seldom seen by anybody except information technology 
workers. 
Consumers who use Scientific-Atlanta set-top boxes in their living rooms won't likely see changes anytime soon 
because of Cisco's ownership, said analyst Kagan. 
"This step is not going to make a change today for Scientific-Atlanta customers or cable customers or telephone 
companies," he said. "But what it's going to do is empower Cisco to be at the ground level of all these changes 
as they unfold over the next several years." 
Cisco was founded in 1984 by a group of scientists from Stanford University, the same school that spawned 
other tech industry icons such as Hewlett-Packard and Google. The company was named after nearby San 
Francisco. 
One of Cisco's first products was something called the Advanced Gateway Server, which helped change the way 
computers are networked. 
For years, Cisco operated in relative obscurity, even though its initial public offering in 1990 gave it an instant 
market capitalization of $224 million and caught the eye of Wall Street investors. 
Turning point in '95 
It wasn't until Chambers was appointed CEO in 1995 that the company really started to take off. Under 
Chambers, the company's annual sales grew from about $1.2 billion to $25 billion and its stock became a Wall 
Street favorite. 
Along the way, Cisco and its CEO, an unassuming yet charismatic West Virginia native who still speaks with a 
drawl, joined the technology industry's most influential players. 
Friday, Chambers joked of another benefit of the Scientific-Atlanta buyout: Now, at least some of his new 
employees can understand his Southern accent.

SAN FRANCISCO (XFN-ASIA) - Cisco Systems Inc. said Friday it agreed to buy cable television set-top box 
maker Scientific-Atlanta Inc. for $6.9 billion, adding the leading maker of products that let consumers receive 
high-speed Internet service over cable. 
Cisco offered $43 a share in cash for Scientific-Atlanta and agreed to assume all of the company's outstanding 
stock options. Excluding the $1.55 billion in cash on Scientific-Atlanta's balance sheet, Cisco will be paying $5.3 
billion. 
In early trading, Cisco shares fell 28 cents to $17.09. Scientific-Atlanta, which has climbed over 25% from 
October lows on rumors of a deal, rose 65 cents to $42.10. 
Cisco, the top maker of networking equipment, is pushing into the market for low-cost gear for consumers and 
small businesses as broadband connections increase. 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple-play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication and online services," said John Chambers, president and chief executive officer 
of Cisco Systems. 
Scientific-Atlanta, of Lawrenceville, Ga., is the second largest provider of TV set-top boxes behind Motorola. It 
also sells digital video recorders and cable modems. Its top customers include Time Warner , Cablevision 
Systems, and Comcast Corp. 
The company, founded in 1951 by six engineers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, has annual revenue of 
about $1.9 billion. 
Lower Margins 
While sales of Cisco's low-cost gear are growing faster than sales to corporate customers and phone companies, 
however, they are less profitable and still contribute less than a fifth of the firm's revenue. 
The San Jose, Calif.-based company still gets nearly half its revenue by selling data switches to corporations, 
while another quarter or so comes from sales of Internet routers. 
Cisco shares have hovered more-than-two year lows since it forecast that sales in the fiscal year ending in July 
2006 would rise in the low double-digits. 
It expects the deal will be neutral to fiscal 2006 earnings and slightly lift adjusted 2007 earnings.

Cisco Systems, Inc., today said its purchase of Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., would give it the final piece it needed to 
offer an end-to-end platform for converged providers of voice, high-speed data, wireless, and video services. The 
purchase will cost Cisco $6.9 billion ($5.3 billion net of Scientific-Atlanta’s existing cash balance), or $43 per 
share, and is expected to close in the third quarter of Cisco’s fiscal year 2006. 
“This completes a large part of our quadruple play as voice, video, data, and mobility converge,” Cisco President 
and Chief Executive Officer John Chambers said during a press briefing this morning. And video services are 
emerging as a “key element in service providers’ quadruple-play bundles” - perhaps the most important element 
in ensuring the “stickiness” of a bundle, he said. 
Cisco expects that being able to integrate all of these aspects of the quadruple play into its architecture will 
increase sales. “An integrated architecture is, in our opinion, the only way to reduce the complexity” of offering so 
many services over a converged network, Mr. Chambers said. 
Following completion of the transaction, Scientific-Atlanta will become a division of the routing and service 
provider technology group at Cisco, which is run by Senior Vice President Mike Volpi. Scientific Atlanta’s 
chairman, CEO, and president, Jim McDonald, will report to Mr. Volpi. - Brian Hammond, bhammond@tr.com

Scientific-Atlanta Inc. CEO Jim McDonald and Cisco Systems Inc. vice president of corporate business 
development Ned Cooper spoke with Multichannel News technology editor Matt Stump Friday, the day Cisco 
announced its $6.9 billion deal to acquire S-A. An edited transcript follows: 
MCN: Can you tell us the evolution of how this deal came about? We heard Samsung Electronics America Inc. 
and others were in the running. We’re you negotiating simultaneously, or did you have an exclusive negotiating 
period with Cisco over the last month or so? 
McDonald: It starts with a lot of strategic planning, a lot of reviews with our board, things we present and outside 
people we bring in to present. We focused on: Where is the industry going long-term? How is all of this stuff going 
to evolve? 
The first phase is about bundled services and, now, bringing wireless in so you have the quad play. This thing will 
move to a set of sequences, which are on-demand, integrated applications, personal applications, and what that 
means is that you need to bring all of this stuff together. 
We had a lot of strength with video and systems integration. There are a lot of things in the voice and data space 
that we didn’t bring to the table. 
When you start to look at the customer’s needs, there were things we had to fill out in this thing to do it. You’ve 
got three approaches to it. You can try to staff up and do it and in voice and data, and that would be a Herculean 
thing for someone like us to do. You can partner, but, in many cases, you have to be a little bit nervous about 
value leaking out of the partnership over time, and will you really retain your uniqueness? 
In our case, we have $1.5 billion in cash, and the question is: Should we be an acquirer or should we be 
acquired? As we looked around at the options, it became obvious that the best match in this thing was Cisco. 
We’ve known the executives for a long period of time. As we got more engaged, it became obvious that this was 
a match. 
We did talk to some other people in the process to understand what their interests were. As we concluded that 
this was the right partnership, then it became: How do you get the right price for your shareholders? 
MCN : How much did opportunities in the telco market drive this deal? 
McDonald: The worldwide opportunity is the largest over time. We’re doing a little bit over 20% of our sales 
internationally. Cisco has a little over one-half of their sales internationally. We don’t have any telephone 
relationships internationally, even though we have the technology. Our ability to take this on a worldwide basis 
was quite limited, to staff to sell into the telephony community. International is a very large opportunity for us. 
We had our best quarter ever internationally last quarter. So the opportunity is out there. But we need to leverage 
it quickly, and this provides a lot of incremental opportunity. 
Cooper: IP telco video and the network digital homes are in the early stages of market transition. And we see 
significant growth opportunities in those businesses on a global basis going forward. By combining S-A’s video 
capability with Cisco IP [Internet-protocol] technology and our data, voice and mobility capability, as well as our 
global channels and our Linksys product, we think we can provide an offering into the market that is unmatched. 
MCN : What about cable’s play with Sprint Nextel Corp. and what you could sell into that partnership?

Page 53 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Cooper: Our Linksys product offers Wi-Fi-access points. When you think about what cable and wireless guys are 
trying to do -- things like applications with dual-mode 802.11 in a cellular phone, so when you come into the 
home, you roam onto the home wireless network -- we provide the home Wi-Fi access point. 
We have partnerships with companies like Motorola [Inc.] and Nokia [Corp.] to build dual-mode phones. We’re 
also the worldwide leader in selling IP backbone and data-applications infrastructure into mobile-wireless-service 
providers. We can provide an end-to-end capability for roaming between the wireless and wireline network. 
MCN : Can you talk a little about Time Warner Cable’s and Comcast Corp.’s reactions? Time Warner might have 
a concern about you being swallowed up by a big company and not being as responsive as in the past. 
McDonald: We have confidential relationships, so I did call our customers last night after our board approved this. 
I talked to [Time Warner Cable chairman and CEO] Glenn Britt last night, and he was very positive. Today, [Cisco 
CEO] John Chambers and I called Glenn and talked to him together about it. He is a large customer of Cisco, 
and we’re the largest supplier for all of Time Warner. We both have very good relations. 
Our customers are moving toward these integrated solutions and, as a result, they viewed it as positive. I talked 
to [chief operating officer] Tom Rutledge of Cablevision [Systems Corp.] last night, and he was quite positive 
about it. 
MCN : There’s a lot of discussion about moving to an all-IP platform. How soon do you see that happening with 
your cable customers? 
Cooper: In the end, it’s about the consumer and providing services to the consumer. We both see the opportunity 
to provide integrated voice, video, data and mobility services into the consumer as the opportunity that is the best 
one for service providers to increase their RPUs [revenue per unit] by adding more services on top of the existing 
networks. 
And IP is far and away the best technology to deploy integrated services on the network. The timing of the 
evolution depends on many factors, but there is no question that the applications on the network will converge on 
IP. We can help the service providers speed that transition by bringing together the combined expertises. 
McDonald: You have to start where you are and figure out how to go from there. If you’re someone like SBC 
[Communications Inc.], you’re going to build an all-IP network to start with -- basically, have a green-field 
approach. You already have voice and data services out there, so it’s only natural that you would do IP video. 
If you look at the cable operator, they have three different services that are frequency-separated on the same 
network. So while the video comes down MPEG, you have IP voice and services that are IP-formatted. 
Most of the device world in consumer electronics is all IP-based. Everybody is on transition path. If you have a 
whole lot of MPEG set-tops in there, you are going to be a lot slower-moving in that direction. You can still get to 
the services. We can do switched digital video in that domain and give you the segmented services. Everybody is 
moving in that direction. But everybody will have a little different strategy.

OVERVIEW 
On 11/18/05, CSCO announced the acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta (SFA). The purchase price for SFA was 
approx. $6.9b or $43 per outstanding share in cash. Excluding net cash from SFA's balance sheet, the net 
purchase price is $5.3b. 
FINANCIAL DATA 
A. Key Data From Call 1. Purchase price of SFA = approx. $6.9b or $43 per outstanding share. 2. Net purchase 
price of SFA = $5.3b, excluding the net cash from SFA's balance sheet. 
PRESENTATION SUMMARY 
S1. Transaction Details (J.C.) 1. CSCO's Overall Decision & Strategy: 1. The announcement on 11/18/05 
represents much more than an exciting opportunity for CSCO. 1. It is literally complete, a large part of the 
quadruple play as data, voice, video, and mobility converges. 2. In many industry analysts' perspective, CSCO is 
in the leadership position for sustainable differentiation in data, voice, and mobility convergence. 1. The 
announcement on 11/18/05 is a major move in completing the fourth element, which is video leadership. 3. The 
Co.'s strategy has clearly been that intelligence will be distributed throughout the network, and the network will 
eventually become the platform of the future. 4. CSCO believes that layers 1-7 of OSI stack would first be loosely 
and then tightly coupled together with all elements encompassing the convergence of data, voice, video, and 
mobility. 1. The future service provider and consumer markets will in the Co.'s opinion require intelligence, 
applications, storage, processors, and services (Indiscernible) throughout the network. 2. The Co. believes that 
the acquisition on 11/18/05 extends its commitment and leadership in both the service provider and consumer 
market segment. 5. As stated in 1Q06: 1. Service provider market segment is approx. 25% of the total product 
business. 2. Consumer market segment is approx. 4%. 3. Both are key drivers for future growth opportunities. 6. 
The market opportunities represented by this announcement is expected to become the eighth advanced 
technology in the area that the Co. will call, digital video. 7. The Co.'s current seven advanced technologies 
include: 1. Home networking. 2. Enterprise IP communication. 3. Optical networking. 4. Security. 5. Storage area 
networking. 6. Wireless. 7. Hosted small business systems (Linksys One ). 2. Video Strategies: 1. Video is 
emerging as a key element in the service provider quadruple play bundle, encompassing consumer 
entertainment, communications, and online services. 1. In fact, video may be the most critical element in this 
bundle for ensuring consumer differentiation and loyalty to service providers. 2. The opportunity for CSCO is to 
dramatically reduce the complexity of converging data, voice, video over IP and both a fixed and mobile 
environment, which is at the core of the Co.'s expertise. 1. An integrated architecture is in the Co.'s opinion the 
only way to reduce this complexity. 3. The Co.'s experience in this market has shown that more one provides an 
end-to-end solution to service providers and to the consumer, the greater it is likelihood of gaining a larger share 
of their CapEx. 1. For example, this integrated end-to-end approach that the service providers do rapidly and cost 
effectively deploys new services. 4. From a consumer market perspective, the Co. believes the consumer view is 
driving the next wave of applications in the home. 1. Therefore, the infrastructure of the future must evolve to 
enable consumers to personalize their experiences with data, voice, video, and mobility. 2. This had a broad 
reach in three of these key areas that makes up the quadruple play for service providers, data, voice, and 
mobility. 5. Scientific-Atlanta (SFA) in the Co.'s opinion is the leader in the fourth area, video touching directly

Page 55 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
approx. 50m consumers. 1. With this acquisition, CSCO offers an end-to-end quadruple play in the service 
provider market segment, and expands the quad play in the consumer markets. 6. In the Co.'s opinion, SFA 
brings the broadest reach in combination of video expertise in the market ranging from: 1. Set-top boxes to 
transmission networks, and the professional services to both deliver and remake video work uniquely for the full 
solution. 7. As stated many times, the Co. believes that the industry in which CSCO and SFA participate will 
consolidate. 1. This innovation will continue to be through internal development, acquisition, and partnerships. 2. 
In CSCO's opinion, for companies to lead both from an innovation and a market share perspective, they must be 
able to do all three. 8. Video entertainment is becoming increasingly (Phonetic) digital and on-demand, with rapid 
global adaptation of high-definition TV and digital video recording, (Indiscernible) migration to IP centric platforms. 
1. Cable operators are entering a network and set-top box upgrade cycle. 2. Telcos are building out new 
infrastructure for delivery of video entertainment. 9. SFA's total is approx. 6% of CSCO's current market 
capitalization. 1. This immediately positions CSCO as an end-to-end leader in the key strategic area of video 
delivery for the service provider market segment, which industry analysts' believe to be approx. $10b market 
opportunity by 2009. 10. In combination with the strong consumer market position through Linksys, the Co. 
expects to now have a more complete portfolio for the digital home. 1. In particular, the Co.'s abilities to create a 
unified home network with SFA's set-top boxes, and Linksys network entertainment product provide CSCO with a 
unique differentiation in the consumer market segment. 3. Deal Highlights: 1. The purchase price for SFA was 
approx. $6.9b or $43 per outstanding share in cash. 2. After removing the net cash from SFA's balance sheet, the 
net purchase price is $5.3b. 3. The Co. expects the acquisition to be: 1. Neutral to its pro forma earnings in FY06. 
2. Slightly accretive to pro forma earnings in FY07, and financed with a combination of cash and debt. 4. SFA's 
current estimated growth rate according to industry analysts' is 10-12%. 5. After the combination and including 
synergies brought by CSCO, there is the potential with the appropriate caveat as outlined to grow between 
12-16%, compounded annual growth from FY07 to FY10 for the area of video that SFA is focused on. 6. The 
acquisition has been accrued by the Board of Directors of each co., and is subject to various closing conditions. 7. 
CSCO expects the acquisition of SFA to close during its 3Q06 subject to regulatory approval. 8. Upon the close, 
SFA is expected to join CSCO's routing and service provider technology group, under the leadership of SVP Mike 
Volpi. 9. On 11/17/05, the Co. shared with appropriate confidentiality commitment of the announcement with two 
major US service providers, and one European service provider. 1. They were very direct in saying that this 
combination makes tremendous sense, and brings a unique excitement to the industry. 2. In various ways, each 
of them articulated how this combination represents the potential to uniquely position CSCO from an architectural 
perspective for both service providers and the consumer. 
S2. Additional Highlights (J.M.) 1. Highlights: 1. The announcement on 11/18/05 of the agreement to SFA be 
acquired by CSCO is a landmark event in its history. 2. The combined strengths and resources of the two 
companies will position to address more quickly the growing number of opportunities in served markets. 1. More 
rapid time to market, and a broader base of new products and systems will benefit all of the stakeholders with 
particular emphasis on customers, employees, and shareholders. 2. Decision Process: 1. The markets that SFA 
serves has been changing rapidly and it believes the rate of change will accelerate. 2. The Co. expects a variety 
of inter-related changes. 1. Technology advantages will make new products available. 2. Customers' markets will 
consolidate. 3. Bundling of many services, including video, will become increasingly important to all of the 
customers. 3. Over the past 12 years, SFA has seen tremendous amount of consolidation among the cable 
operators. 1. Today, two top cable operators serve more than 30m subscribers. 2. During this consolidation, 
technology has changed rapidly, allowing the customers to offer new services. 3. Cable customers are now 
moving to new network architectures to allow the delivery of video, high-speed data, and voice services over a 
converged network. 4. At the same time, telephone companies are entering the entertainment market, and are 
offering a bundle of video, data, and voice services. 1. These customers want more complete integrated solutions 
from fewer vendors. 2. This rapid change in technology can be seen in SFA's newest products. 3. SFA offers hard 
drives and modems in set-tops and cable modems now can support both data and voice services. 4. Soon, SFA 
expects to have DVD burners available in the digital video recorders. 5. This dynamic environment generates a 
tremendous amount of potential for SFA. 5. However, SFA needs a greater in resources to capture the 
opportunities and the expanding markets. 6. As a result, SFA has evaluated a variety of opportunities to: 1. 
Identify a combination that would provide the most value to the shareholders. 2. Enable to provide a broader set 
of products to meet customers expanding need. 3. Leverage complementary technologies 4. At the same time, 
have compatible corporate cultures. 4. CSCO and SFA have achieved tremendous technical leadership and 
strong positions in their respective markets. 1. The combined skills and experience of CSCO and SFA positions 
uniquely to provide the products and systems not only for today's architectures, but also for the next-generation 
architectures that the customers are planning and beginning to implement. 5. The worldwide markets served by 
the companies are growing in large. 1. Together, SFA can offer complete solutions to the customers for their 
integrated intelligent networks and customer premise equipment including home networking. 2. The customers 
will be able to enhance their competitive position by taking advantage of the cost effective end-to-end solutions. 6. 
Both companies' cultures are compatible. 1. Both companies lead with technology and have strong engineering

Page 56 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
oriented environments. 2. Both companies recognize that their long success is related to the ability to serve their 
customers very well. 3. Both companies are committed to the health and wealth for their employees and the 
quality of life in the communities, which they operate. 7. SFA believes that this transaction is beneficial to its 
shareholders. 1. This transactions offers $43 per share or approx. $6.9b, representing a 28% premium over the 
closing price on Oct. 27. 8. On an enterprise basis, which is adjusted for cash and short-term investments net of 
debt on SFA's balance sheet, the premium vs. closing price on Oct. 27 is approx. 40%. 3. Calculation: 1. In 
calculating the premium, the Co. began with the stock price on Oct. 27. 2. The closing price of the stock on Oct. 
27 was $33.62, reflecting the sum of two components. 1. The operation of SFA would generate financial results 
on an ongoing basis. 2. The cash and short-term investments net of debt. 3. If the cash and short-term 
investments net of debt represent approx. $10 per share, the operation of the Co. was valued at approx. $23.62 
share. 1. This was the enterprise value on Oct. 27. 3. Similar to this, CSCO offered $43 per share and valued the 
operation of SFA at approx. $33. 1. The difference between the two amounts represent approx. $10 of cash and 
short-term investments. 2. The enterprise value premium of this transaction is the difference in value between the 
enterprise value of the offer and the enterprise value on Oct. 27. 3. This difference of $9.38 representing a 
premium of approx. 40%. 4. In the process, SFA selected fairness opinions from three outside parties. 1. Credit 
Suisse First Boston, and Evercore advised SFA on this transaction. 2. Lehman Brothers, which was not otherwise 
involved in the sale. 5. There are a lot of decisions yet to be made and many details that the mgt. teams must 
work out. 1. CSCO is committed to enabling SFA to continue to execute its business plan. 6. President and CEO 
will remain with the Co. for two years, and all of the SFA senior mgt. team has agreed to stay on following of close 
of the transaction. 4. Summary: 1. SFA is taking an extraordinary successful co. and enhancing this prospect for 
continuous success by joining with CSCO. 2. SFA believes that the combination will better enable it to serve its 
existing customers, better position to expand its served markets, and provide a virtually unique set of technical 
capabilities through which it can address the customers needs. 3. SFA believes that the world is full of potential, 
and as part of CSCO, it looks forward to capture those new opportunities. 
QUESTION AND ANSWER SUMMARY 
OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Nikos Theodosopoulos, UBS. 
NIKOS THEODOSOPOULOS, ANALYST, UBS: Well, first of all, let me just say congratulations on what seems to 
be a fair price for both parties and congratulations to Cisco for buying the company with a long history of earnings 
growth in cash flow generation. My question is on the integration, specifically manufacturing and management. 
Scientific-Atlanta does predominantly all its manufacturing. It has a plant in Mexico. Cisco has an outsource 
model. Can you talk about whether you plan on changing that in the near or long-term. Then on management, I 
think I heard Jim say he is going to stay on for a couple of years. I know if I look back at when Motorola bought 
General Instrument, there was a lot of momentum lost in that company in the transition of that in that acquisition. 
Can you talk about how you're going to try to do a good job on the integration between the two companies? 
Thank you. 
JOHN CHAMBERS, PRESIDENT & CEO, CISCO SYSTEMS: Sure. First is I think you started off with exactly the 
right premise. You have got two companies here that see the market evolution almost identical. And they 
complement each other in very unique ways, which we will consolidate as the market consolidates. In terms of the 
teams, as Jim said, all of the senior management has signed up to staying with the combination and secondly, we 
will make no changes in the organization structure for at least one to two years, and may not even at that time. 
In terms of specific manufacturing, our Head of Manufacturing, Angel Mendez and Hector from your all's side are 
down in the manufacturing plant in Mexico at the present time. They are world-class in manufacturing. Our team 
came back and said this was the best manufacturing organization they have seen in Mexico. And a lot of what 
Jim's team does is not individual standalone products. They are very tightly integrated together from their ASICs 
development, to their systems, to their manufacturing, to their consultancy, to their set-top boxes and they have it 
fueled uniquely to make it work. So Nikos, for us to break that part, especially at the beginning, would not make 
any sense at all. 
Secondly, as we have said many times before, we have done world-class acquisitions and 40% plus of our 
management team are from those acquisitions. So Jim has a very broad group of leaders that we've heard an 
awful lot about and we met with this morning and I would expect them not only to stay here at the 
Scientific-Atlanta division within Cisco but for many of them to have, if they're willing to do it, responsibilities well 
beyond this in other segments of Cisco as we move forward. 
I think -- I'm going to ask Jim to comment a little bit on the momentum. I think both of us would anticipate from the 
rumors in the market and questions going on you might lose a little bit of momentum right at the start but we've 
actually seen the reverse from our customers. The few customers that we confidentially bounced this off of last

Page 57 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
night were almost the reserve. I think our biggest challenge, Jim, as we discussed with the leaders today, is to 
prioritize the opportunities. 
We think that you, if we do it right, will see the reserve instead of Jim growing at the 10 to 12% (indiscernible), 
with the appropriate caveats, we think in terms of this opportunity both in the U.S. but also opening up a large 
segment of the international field could potentially change that growth rate from 10 to 12 to 12 to 16 more in the 
traditional rate that we have both seen. Jim, your thoughts? 
JIM MCDONALD, PRESIDENT & CEO, SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA: I think first relative to the manufacturing thing. 
We're quite proud of what the people have built in Juarez and when I came 12 years ago we had ours outsourced 
in Japan and we were losing all the value we were regenerating through the currency transactions. And we had a 
large part of our business that goes into North America and you can imagine the number of trucks and semis that 
have to pull out when you ship 1.1 million, 1.2 million set-tops each quarter. So a lot of the manufacturing strategy 
has got to be based on where your customers are, what you have to get to them. We have a lot of it sourced 
outside in terms of components and parts and most of that is really sourced in the Far East. So manufacturing 
strategies need to be flexible. 
I think on the other point is we have obviously had some distractions with all the publications and things that have 
surrounded this over the last couple of weeks. I am sure, as our organizations go forward, there will be some 
distractions. But if you look at the long-term combination, we have a tremendous potential here to grow the 
business. 
OPERATOR: Steve Kamman, CIBC. 
STEVE KAMMAN, ANALYST, CIBC: I have got two questions. Number one is strategically, as you know, the 
whole set-top box market is undergoing some pretty significant transition probably I think enabled by Cisco trying 
to can opener some of the more proprietary elements of that model. So I guess the question is how are you going 
to manage that transition if you get to more of an open set-top model and that leads into kind of the next element 
of my question, which is while I do agree SFA is a phenomenally well-managed company, you're looking at gross 
margins in the 37, 40% range, operating margins in the 20% range, 17 to 20% range. You guys are obviously 
significantly higher than that. Do you think you can bring SFA up to more of a Cisco like margin model or is this 
going to pull down the margins out of Cisco? I realize it's early in the transaction but this is something you had to 
have thought about. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Okay, Steve. Break it into pieces. We, both Jim and I, do not see the market as evolved as 
individual boxes. We basically see a market where, using the OSI stock as an example, layers one through seven 
come together. Intelligent, at first throughout the network, and then over time the network becoming the platform. 
And I think this really is one more step along that way. 
In terms of the set-top box market, you watch what is there. It's an ASICs product. It's a combination and the 
uniqueness that Scientific-Atlanta brings and this is an art to make video really work well. That was one of the 
lessons that we have learned by talking with service providers and cable companies around the world. It is an art 
to make this work. were. They bring the combination of that to the market. So what customers will pay a premium 
for and there will obviously be different margin models just like there is in our Linksys market where we have 
much lower gross margins and much lower operating expenses. We will go after markets in terms of what is the 
bottom line profit potential and as you begin to provide an end-to-end solution with industry-leading innovation 
and products that integrate together and it would therefore reduce the risk for our customers and increase their 
time to market to get their revenues. For the consumer, less complexity. That actually will increase your margin 
potential in total. 
Do I expect Scientific-Atlanta's margins to come all the way up to Cisco? No, of course not. But do I think, just 
like the Linksys model, you're going to begin to make integration together and I think in total, we will improve our 
joint margins more than we would without the combination to occur. 
JIM MCDONALD: I think the other thing to think about is that what you are really trying to do is drive new services 
to the consumer. And if you think of where storage is for example we do VOD and SVOD and we have new things 
our customers are doing, which allows you to restart a program when you come in 20 minutes late, you can 
restart it. At the same time, you have storage in the device. So you have DVRs and you have a lot of function 
there. So I think what you find is all parts of the model drive each other and some parts of the model have one 
profitability analysis and other parts have a different. I think what you really are going to do is they are going to be 
complementary and drive each other and some pieces will be lower but a lot of other pieces you will drive back in 
the network are much higher profit models.

Page 58 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I agree, Jim. 
OPERATOR: Talli Anni, Merrill Lynch. 
TALLI ANNI, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: My question is Scientific-Atlanta is a great company, great 
execution history but it is a change from the strategy you've said in the past. John, you have said in the past that 
you're going to be looking mostly at acquisitions that are close to the headquarter, small growth companies and 
here you're buying a company that is far from the headquarter. Growth is 10 to 12% rather than the higher growth 
rate you have in your advanced technologies. It is against what you've said in the past. So what led you to take 
this decision to buy a larger company rather than a smaller company? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Well, you are right that our market has traditionally been a combination of 104 companies. 
We've actually had several companies that were in this price range in the 5 to $7 billion that we have done and at 
least one that represented about 20% of our headcount at that point in time. If you look at our focus, we have a 
very firm rule. When you move into markets, you either partner, acquire or develop in the first five to market. Once 
those first five are established by definition, you either partner with them or acquire. 
Video is an integral part of our strategy that must be part of Cisco's competency. And so when, you are right, if 
you look at our five rules of thumb in terms of acquisitions, one of them, geographic proximity, is not matched. But 
the other four actually match very well. It is extremely strategically aligned with how we see the market evolving 
and our vision of that market and the role that we play as data, voice, video converges. So you don't do an 
acquisition, especially of this size, unless it matches very tightly versus the strategy and vision and a sustainable 
differentiation with it. 
Secondly is you create short-term wins for the shareholders, the customers, the employees, essentially the 
employees of the acquired company. We think we have done that very successfully and our chemistry match with 
your people, Jim, is really amazing. We have got a lot of talent here that I'm finding with a group of people that 
understand how I speak with a southern accent. And you are going to find that we will do very well in not just 
retaining the employees but both of our companies have a track record of doing that very effectively. 
Third is the long-term strategic initiative. It opens up to the market in a way that is going to be very difficult for 
competitors to match in terms of how we think this market will evolve and we think these devices will all do data, 
voice, video and mobility integration. And when you bounce this off of our potential customers, there is not a one 
that didn't say this was just an amazing, amazing move and they understand why these two companies will 
uniquely come together. 
The next element that we do look at is similar cultures. It's amazing, when Jim and talked, and it's the same thing 
among our teams, we can almost finish each other sentences about individual customers. What's important to 
them, what's their approach, how do we view them, what do they expect from us, etc.? So our cultures are 
remarkably similar. You do have a geographic proximity issue here. If Jim were in Silicon Valley, it would be five 
out of five. But four out of five isn't bad and I go back to the most basic issue of all probably, which is the first five 
to market are always the leaders long-term. Scientific-Atlanta is number one in our opinion by a very long way, 
not just in products but integration. So that's why we focused on it and I think this will be a very successful 
acquisition. 
If you watch the three or four that have made a difference in our future, the first one, Crescendo, an acquisition, 
which for $10 million of revenue turned out to be billions of dollars in terms of revenue per year now. StrataCom, 
which clearly brought us into the market and it was the largest acquisition we have done at that point in time over 
$5 billion and a lot of headcount. Then the Linksys acquisition, which a year and a half ago led us into the 
consumer market, and now I think the Scientific-Atlanta one that leads us into the video integration. 
So while we have done a lot of acquisitions, I'd really put Scientific-Atlanta in potentially the top four if we both 
execute well. Jim, I don't if you would add to that? 
JIM MCDONALD: I think if you'd look at our customer base, especially all the large customers, I think you would 
find that all of our large customers are very large customers of Cisco. So it starts with we have an enormous 
amount of synergy coming from the customer. So if you start there and you start to move back, I think that we 
deal with very similar technologies. We have similar makeups in how our organizations are structured in terms of 
talent. So I think as you look through the things, there is just a whole lot of things that are very common starting 
all the way with the customer. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I would agree. Next question please.

OPERATOR: Tim Long, Banc of America. 
TIM LONG, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA: Two quick ones if I could. First, John, for you, maybe could you just 
talk a little bit about Cisco's position in cable, fairly diversified. So could you discuss a little bit if this maybe 
causes a disruption in some of your other cable business maybe in some networks that are more driven by 
Motorola. So do you see an impact to the rest of the cable business? And then for Jim, I'd love to get some 
customer thoughts out of you, even if not from discussions in the last 24 hours. I'm sure you've had these 
discussions over the last few years and particularly would love to know if there have been certain examples, 
whether in the U.S. or internationally, where large deals maybe that didn't go your way could have more clearly 
gone your way if you had a more diverse product offering, including what you're going to have to offer now with 
Cisco. Thanks. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: First, Tim, in terms of the cable business, it has been a tremendously successful segment 
for Cisco, not just in terms of revenue. It grew over 30% this last year and as we said in prior conference calls, 
crossed the $1 billion market for Cisco and while Mike is here, I feel very comfortable in speaking for him on this 
one that I clearly expect with the appropriate caveat that they would grow again in excess of 30%. But if you 
watch what this does, this makes end cable an end-to-end solution and this is very similar to what we have done 
in enterprise. So when you think about an enterprise, what we've been very successful on was an architectural 
play where we filled in all the pieces. 
In cable, we have done the exact same thing. You are now in a position where together we are the key leader 
with a very large marketshare and the traditional routing. We are the clear leader in IP telephony. We are the 
leader in mobility and when you look at the cable combinations with companies like Sprint Nextel, you begin to 
realize the leverage from the mobility side of the house. 
Once you add video to that, not just from a product perspective but an integration and tying this all together, 
which Jim's team is amazing at making work, that gives us I think leadership that is very, very unique and I think 
you'll find the cable players, Tim, probably without exception will say this was a tremendous move for them. I 
would expect you would see them move very rapidly in terms of what we can do together. 
I would add just one other issue before I turn it over to Jim, which is we think we can bring a lot together in the 
international community, which has not been a major focus of Scientific-Atlanta up to this time. So whether it is 
in cable or the traditional BTTs, we think that's a large opportunity for us as well. Jim, to you. 
JIM MCDONALD: If you think of the two parts you asked. The first one is I called my largest two customers last 
night because we have confidential relationships with them and we have been friends for a long time and they 
were both very positive on the transaction. They are also very large customers of Cisco today. So they know 
Cisco. They know us very well. So I think if you look at the customer side of this thing, they are quite positive 
because they are interested in speed to market, how they get new services in front of the consumer, how they put 
all of this stuff and integrate it together. As you do this, these things get more complicated and you need more 
depth of resources and you need a lot of different kinds of resources to do it. So they were quite positive. 
Have I lost a deal I should have gotten? Sure. I've lost one and I know specifically why I lost it was because I 
didn't have the ongoing relationship with the customer because as the telephone guys enter the market, we don't 
have that long historical relationship with those guys. Even though we were selected as having the best products, 
we lost the deal because we didn't have the relationship. Having said that, having given up on it, we are about to 
get back in. But especially if you look at the international markets, we don't have the relationships to carry the 
switch digital video internationally. We don't have the telephone relationships. This is clearly an area where we 
can get a lot of acceleration because Cisco has these relationships and we have things we can sell them. We just 
don't have the relationships with the customers. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: It's interesting. One last comment on the cable. Jim touched base with his two largest. I 
touched base with my largest and my largest said, John, this makes tremendous sense for you all together and 
we view you in a different way than we even did before even though you were very strategic before. Thank you, 
Tim. 
OPERATOR: Brantly Thompson, Goldman Sachs. 
BRANTLEY THOMPSON, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: John, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit 
about the growth rate. You had put into two buckets; SFA at 10 to 12% and then potentially 12 to 16%. You 
commented that the non U.S. is part of that opportunity. But could you talk about what things you will be putting in 
place to try to expand that growth rate and when we might see some milestones around that?

Page 60 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Sure. Breaking it into the segments. First of all, we believe that our own market, prior to this 
combination, was going to grow in the 10 to 15% range and we have been very open in our views on that. The 
second part in terms of the approach, if you begin to think about the synergies that you now bring to the telco 
market and to the cable marketplace, those could be pretty substantial for our joint customers today. 
The elements outside the U.S., and remember, Mike, what is it? The majority of our service provider business is 
outside the U.S., 60% and it is growing at a faster rate than inside the U.S. in most of the quarters. Especially in 
the Asia-Pacific and our emerging geographies. So that clearly would be key element. IP/TV will take off. So while 
we are very united in architectural approach in the cable marketplace and they will be really the first service 
providers where we will be providing end-to-end architectures, we are beginning to see the telcos really focused 
on IP/TV and Jim's team has been able to do that in a very unique way in talking to the customers, not mentioning 
the combination when they talked about Scientific-Atlanta. They said this company really gets this and they 
have both the products. But more importantly an integration capability to tie it together. Thank you very much. 
OPERATOR: Alex Henderson, Citigroup. 
ALEX HENDERSON, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the advanced 
technology decision to categorize this as one. It seems a little bit different from what most people would have 
thought was the approach. It almost seems like you're taking existing businesses and slicing them in and calling 
them advanced technologies platforms now. Should we be changing the way we're thinking about that a little bit? 
You are starting with an acquisition here that is fairly sizable, which obviously puts you much further down the 
curve. How should we think about further acquisitions that might launch advanced technologies platforms? 
Should we be viewing this as one of a number of steps to fill out that platform? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I think that would be the right way to do it. I think if you think about advanced technologies, 
you want to think about it as technology market segments that have a potential to be $1 billion business for Cisco 
that we think we can maintain if we execute right a sustainable differentiation that our target is 40% plus 
marketshare as we move into those, and that it fits in and could be integrated with our other advanced 
technologies in our core routing and switching. Scientific-Atlanta clearly hits all those elements. 
We will use emerging technologies and we've announced two of them already this year as if you think about it 
internal development, in terms of opportunities that may develop in advanced technologies. And when they 
become advanced, we then will focus the resources of the whole company on them. But our movement the other 
day with the Linksys One approach and our movement today, we will announce one more yet this year probably 
at the analysts meeting in terms of a ninth advanced technology; really speaks to movement into new markets 
that we believe will integrate tightly over time into our strategy. If we do our job right, you will see us just continue 
to generate those. I don't expect them all to be successful, although I know this one will. But we will take some of 
the risk in other advanced technologies as we move forward. 
ALEX HENDERSON: If I might follow on with that. Historically, you talk about integration risk as a major concern 
about doing larger acquisitions. If you've got this fairly sizable acquisition to integrate, should we anticipate that 
that would diminish the probability of a similar approach in the near-term at least? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Let me answer that question indirectly. I don't have -- I don't normally do what I call 
medium-sized acquisitions. We have done two or three of them in the past. We may do some of them in the 
future. We don't believe in real large acquisitions. 5000 of Jim's people are in the manufacturing arena, about 
2000 are in the professional service engineering arena, etc. So for 2000 engineers, I don't view this as a large 
acquisition in the sense that is going to take a huge amount of time to get the groups working effectively. 
The fact that we're keeping it as an independent division reporting to Mike and the service provider strategy 
speaks to the importance of not losing momentum as we move forward in this arena. But I think, just like our 
sampling of acquisitions that we have done over the last 12 years has been in a range that this one very much fits 
into, the majority of them will continue to be small acquisitions, privately held, 100 engineers being ideal. But, 
Alex, what we will never violate is once a market starts to go, we see the market transition occurring, if we are not 
in the first five there on our own internal development, we will either partner or acquire one of the first five. This 
video is way to important to me and to Jim to do this in a partnership type of arrangement. So I think you'll find 
that they will fit in very, very tightly in terms of the direction. 
JIM MCDONALD: I think one of the things you will see as a trend is customers are going to continue to reduce the 
number of vendors that they have and the reason is that the integration of these things is the critical element and 
the more vendors you bring to the table, the more difficult the integration problem is. So I think anyone that can 
come to market with a complete set of solutions is going to make this an awful lot easier for the customers.

Page 61 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: It's basically as those products are at first loosely coupled together and then tightly coupled 
together. So this is right down the sweet spot. It's what we said we were going to do for a decade; data, voice, 
video converging with mobility. We think time will tell if we're right but we think it is a huge move both in the 
service provider and in the consumer marketplace. But looking out two to four years, I think we will also expand it 
in our enterprise direction. Next question please. 
OPERATOR: Bill Becklean, Oppenheimer. 
BILL BECKLEAN, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER: I'd like to pursue the whole notion of increasing 
Scientific-Atlanta's growth rate from 10 to 12 to 12 to 16 and that is -- it strikes me as the entire market for 
Scientific-Atlanta's products isn't growing 12 to 16. So what you're talking about is trying to drive an entire 
market, not just take share, to get Scientific-Atlanta's growth rate up and that follows into my more important 
question and that is when I'm looking at your advanced technology initiatives, most of those have had very high 
growth rates associated with them. Are you telling us here that there are no billion dollar opportunities out there 
that are going to be growing north of 15% that can drive your top-line growth in the future? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: It's the reverse of that, Bill and thank you for the question that I know may be on people's 
mind. First the advanced technology that we announced, the Linksys One, is a super high-growth marketplace 
and they will start small but the growth rates from those companies, as we have seen in other areas, if they are 
successful is, in the early phases, in the 50 to 100 maybe even 200% type of ranges year-over-year. As you 
begin to look at driving an entire market, I'd just like to qualify that by saying think about Scientific-Atlanta, 75% 
of your business here in the U.S., 25% outside the U.S. So you have the majority of the world for their products at 
the present time had not gotten the penetration and we had the relationships in these key service providers from 
the BTs, to the DTs, to the Telefonicas, to Telecom Italias, the emerging markets, the Telstras, the areas in India, 
etc. So we actually see this as a major opportunity to gain a larger share of that $10 billion market looking out let's 
say by 2009, 2010 from the 2 billion that Scientific-Atlanta has. 
The synergies will also tie, that if we do our job right, we will sell more of our product and the combination will 
allow us to get higher gross margins and also improve dramatically the services and profitability our partners 
have. So I think you'll see us do both. You'll see us enter certain markets that are very strategic to us that are 
growing in more our traditional growth rates and we think we can accelerate those by a combination. You'll 
continue to see us enter a number of markets that are new and have rapid growth but will probably be material 
looking out two to five years and then you will see us continue to drive our current advanced technologies, which 
I'm very pleased with. They grew about 25% quarter-over-quarter this last quarter. So it will be a combination of 
all the above and Bill, thank you for the clarification question. 
OPERATOR: Mark Sue, RBC Capital Markets. 
MARK SUE, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Can you just give us some further specifics on execution and 
management, on senior management commitments? How do you prevent Scientific-Atlanta from becoming 
another Sailent (ph)? And separately, if I look at end-to-end video, it still seems we're missing some elements for 
IP/TV. How much more do you need to spend on video and how much do you need to spend on mobility? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I'm going to divide the question between Jim and I. One of the things that Jim does 
extremely well is this culture here is one of very much an employee family. Their loyalty and their turnover is 
actually even better than Cisco which we run, as you all know, 4% voluntary. We also have done a remarkable 
job. Some of the acquisitions, we've held all managers for nearly a decade. Some of the others we've had a little 
bit more turnover. But if you watch our turnover of our acquired companies, in total they only run about 4%. So 
the first thing you look at in terms of the Company as to the strategicness to you is can you hold the key leaders 
and can you hold the key engineers and salespeople, etc. 
Jim and I are very comfortable with our ability to do that, and actually the team has signed up to very fair 
contracts both ways. So it really is based upon trust but also willing to put the financial commitments behind their 
commitment along that line. Jim, you know your team here, and I am very comfortable about their commitment, 
but maybe if you could expand on that. 
JIM MCDONALD: Well, I think if you not only think of the top management but if you think of the whole company, 
generally this is a company where people come to work and they stay here. We don't have much turnover. I'm on 
my 13th year here, and when I go to the staff meeting, I'm the youngest one in the history of the company in 
terms of employment. So all of the people that basically work for me have been here before I got here. And if we 
look at all of our people across the organization, they have a tremendous loyalty not only to the company but to 
the customers we work with and to each other. So it wasn't very difficult to get the people to say, look, we want to 
stay part of this.

Page 62 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
I think the other part is we share a common vision of where this is going. And it is a lot easier when you've got 
people all linked in to where they're going and they have a common view of this to keep them going in that 
direction. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: The interesting thing, Mark, as we work through this transaction, you learn more about 
people under stress from both sides than any other time before. While I kidded earlier about having people to talk 
like I do in terms of the southern accent, it was the ability of both of our teams at all levels to work through issues 
with an unusual candidness, but yet a trust and building. And the relationships got stronger and stronger 
throughout this as opposed to what normally occurs in terms of getting frayed the reverse way. 
Mike, just maybe very quickly on IP/TV and mobility, the thoughts? 
MIKE VOLPI, SVP & GENERAL MANAGER, CISCO SYSTEMS: Sure. A couple of quick comments that I would 
make on both IP/TV and your question about mobility. First, you have to realize as was clear in John and Jim's 
comments earlier that a part of the video market is, of course, an existing market, which is where the cable 
operators plan. But part of the video market is clearly a brand-new market segment that comes about by the 
delivery of video over DSL infrastructure or fiber infrastructure, high-speed, telco, broadband infrastructure. This 
is a massive market segment, and as is clear, the video expertise which is brought to the table by the 
Scientific-Atlanta team is quite unique. Video is a systems solution, meaning that you really can't put it together 
in a way in which customers and consumers are accustomed to without interlinking the key components together 
in a systematic approach. And that knowledge base is extremely critical for a lot of the newer customers such as 
the telcos that don't really have a deep amount of experience to that area today. So we think that this IP/TV is a 
huge opportunity for the combined companies, both domestically as well as internationally, where Cisco has a 
great deal of coverage. 
In terms of the question about mobility, and mobility is a huge field and has a lot of opportunity, I would cite a 
couple of areas where I think there is some relevance here. First of all, as you might imagine with broadband 
inside homes comes WiFi, and as WiFi becomes increasingly a distribution mechanism within the home, the 
importance of tying that together with a central location in the home which can be thought of as the set-top box 
location, is something that we think we have a very interesting opportunity to pursue here and do some good 
things with. The other piece is that we do think that long-term, video comes about on terminal devices, on 
handsets, on other new kinds of devices which some might be made by Linksys and some might be made by 
others, but the delivery of video to those devices is again a systems level approach. It's not just about catching a 
stream and showing it on this smaller device or this portable device, but it is about plugging together the pieces 
so the consumer experience can be held together. 
Again, that's where a great deal of Scientific-Atlanta systems level experience can be brought to bear and 
differentiate the combined companies in the marketplace. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Next question, please. 
OPERATOR: Christin Armacost with SG Cowen. 
CHRISTIN ARMACOST, ANALYST, SG COWEN: Two questions. First, can you talk about how you plan to 
integrate the Linksys division with Scientific-Atlanta? I believe Linksys did acquire a set-top box like technology 
called KISS. And then secondly with respect to the U.S. market specifically, there has been a lot of deals already 
announced for the quadruple play from the telcos. So do you think this acquisition today could change any of the 
deals already announced? Thank you. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Jim, I'm going to ask you to answer that second one, but without saying specific names of 
customers, as we both know every one of these in the U.S. It will absolutely be a huge opportunity for us outside 
the U.S. as we capitalize on it. Right time will tell if we can do that or not. In terms of Linksys and 
Scientific-Atlanta and Cisco core routing and switching, we will over time tightly couple the architectures 
together on that. I look at Linksys with the KISS acquisition not as a set-top acquisition at all, but moving 
intelligence into DVDs and moving intelligence throughout the market. But if it goes to the extent that we hope 
that it will, that you will be able to manage, download information, service, etc., electronic devices in the home 
through a Linksys portal. 
So our intent from the time we bought Linksys all the way through was not only to move down market into the 
consumer entertainment and total communications of data, voice, video with mobility, but also to move up market 
to where the service providers could use the Linksys products, uniquely manage them, roll them out to the 
consumer, and what we announced this last week, even to the low-end of small to medium-size business. In 
terms of a little bit of product overlap, that is normal in a marketplace, and I don't think it will be a distraction at all.

Page 63 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
But I see Linksys being separate from Scientific-Atlanta, and both of those separate from our core direction on 
routing and switching to other advanced technologies. 
Jim, maybe your thoughts about customer markets here. And I know we can almost finish each other's sentences 
with the customers here in terms of what opportunities may be, but without getting too specific in a way that might 
get us in trouble with them. 
JIM MCDONALD: Well, on our last conference call I told people that we were in possession of material 
information and we weren't able to buy our stock, and everybody is going to conclude that this was that. Well, 
there's actually more than that. There's other things out there, so our hope is that we are going to want a piece of 
all the major telephone players. So some announced, some not announced. The key for this is that you've got to 
go in and build the relationship with them. You have got to go -- really figure out exactly where they want to go, 
and most of these customers all want something a little bit different. It's all built off of the same core technology, 
but you have to package it a little bit differently. 
So I think what you find is that as you build these relationships, there is an opportunity to do more and more for 
these customers. And if you look at the capital budgets of a couple of guys, they're almost as large as the whole 
cable industry by themselves individually. So it is a huge opportunity to supply these guys, and you never give up 
on them. You've just got to keep going back. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I think Jim and I both enjoy selling, but more importantly we enjoy developing relationships 
which last to make a difference in the market. So I think you'll see this expertise go into the telco market pretty 
effectively. 
JIM MCDONALD: If we add value, they'll do business with us. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Next question please, operator. 
OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question. Cisco Systems and Scientific-Atlanta invite you 
to a business and technical overview of this announcement at 11:00 AM Eastern time today. Telephone 
information and webcast access can be found on both companies' Web pages. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Operator, let me just close on behalf of Jim and I and our employees and our shareholders 
and our customers, we thank you for the time we spent with you today. We really think this offers a very unique 
opportunity in a marketplace and a chance to really, I think, lead in this next market transition on their quadruple 
play, but also really focus initially on the service provider and the consumer. So thank you very much for joining 
us. Jim, it's going to be fun working together. 
JIM MCDONALD: And I would also like to thank you for joining us. I would certainly pass along to all our 
employees that we're certainly proud of all the things we have done and all the things that we're going to be able 
to do together in the future. And we will get around to see all the customers as soon as we can. We know that 
you'll have a lot of questions, but we will get there very quickly and we'll be talking to you today and tomorrow -- 
today and Monday. So thank you for joining us. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Thank you, operator.

OVERVIEW 
On 11/18/05, CSCO announced the acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta (SFA). The purchase price for SFA was 
approx. $6.9b or $43 per outstanding share in cash. Excluding net cash from SFA's balance sheet, the net 
purchase price is $5.3b. 
FINANCIAL DATA 
A. Key Data From Call 1. Purchase price of SFA = approx. $6.9b or $43 per outstanding share. 2. Net purchase 
price of SFA = $5.3b, excluding the net cash from SFA's balance sheet. 
PRESENTATION SUMMARY 
S1. Transaction Details (J.C.) 1. CSCO's Overall Decision & Strategy: 1. The announcement on 11/18/05 
represents much more than an exciting opportunity for CSCO. 1. It is literally complete, a large part of the 
quadruple play as data, voice, video, and mobility converges. 2. In many industry analysts' perspective, CSCO is 
in the leadership position for sustainable differentiation in data, voice, and mobility convergence. 1. The 
announcement on 11/18/05 is a major move in completing the fourth element, which is video leadership. 3. The 
Co.'s strategy has clearly been that intelligence will be distributed throughout the network, and the network will 
eventually become the platform of the future. 4. CSCO believes that layers 1-7 of OSI stack would first be loosely 
and then tightly coupled together with all elements encompassing the convergence of data, voice, video, and 
mobility. 1. The future service provider and consumer markets will in the Co.'s opinion require intelligence, 
applications, storage, processors, and services (Indiscernible) throughout the network. 2. The Co. believes that 
the acquisition on 11/18/05 extends its commitment and leadership in both the service provider and consumer 
market segment. 5. As stated in 1Q06: 1. Service provider market segment is approx. 25% of the total product 
business. 2. Consumer market segment is approx. 4%. 3. Both are key drivers for future growth opportunities. 6. 
The market opportunities represented by this announcement is expected to become the eighth advanced 
technology in the area that the Co. will call, digital video. 7. The Co.'s current seven advanced technologies 
include: 1. Home networking. 2. Enterprise IP communication. 3. Optical networking. 4. Security. 5. Storage area 
networking. 6. Wireless. 7. Hosted small business systems (Linksys One ). 2. Video Strategies: 1. Video is 
emerging as a key element in the service provider quadruple play bundle, encompassing consumer 
entertainment, communications, and online services. 1. In fact, video may be the most critical element in this 
bundle for ensuring consumer differentiation and loyalty to service providers. 2. The opportunity for CSCO is to 
dramatically reduce the complexity of converging data, voice, video over IP and both a fixed and mobile 
environment, which is at the core of the Co.'s expertise. 1. An integrated architecture is in the Co.'s opinion the 
only way to reduce this complexity. 3. The Co.'s experience in this market has shown that more one provides an 
end-to-end solution to service providers and to the consumer, the greater it is likelihood of gaining a larger share 
of their CapEx. 1. For example, this integrated end-to-end approach that the service providers do rapidly and cost 
effectively deploys new services. 4. From a consumer market perspective, the Co. believes the consumer view is 
driving the next wave of applications in the home. 1. Therefore, the infrastructure of the future must evolve to 
enable consumers to personalize their experiences with data, voice, video, and mobility. 2. This had a broad 
reach in three of these key areas that makes up the quadruple play for service providers, data, voice, and

mobility. 5. Scientific-Atlanta (SFA) in the Co.'s opinion is the leader in the fourth area, video touching directly 
approx. 50m consumers. 1. With this acquisition, CSCO offers an end-to-end quadruple play in the service 
provider market segment, and expands the quad play in the consumer markets. 6. In the Co.'s opinion, SFA 
brings the broadest reach in combination of video expertise in the market ranging from: 1. Set-top boxes to 
transmission networks, and the professional services to both deliver and remake video work uniquely for the full 
solution. 7. As stated many times, the Co. believes that the industry in which CSCO and SFA participate will 
consolidate. 1. This innovation will continue to be through internal development, acquisition, and partnerships. 2. 
In CSCO's opinion, for companies to lead both from an innovation and a market share perspective, they must be 
able to do all three. 8. Video entertainment is becoming increasingly (Phonetic) digital and on-demand, with rapid 
global adaptation of high-definition TV and digital video recording, (Indiscernible) migration to IP centric platforms. 
1. Cable operators are entering a network and set-top box upgrade cycle. 2. Telcos are building out new 
infrastructure for delivery of video entertainment. 9. SFA's total is approx. 6% of CSCO's current market 
capitalization. 1. This immediately positions CSCO as an end-to-end leader in the key strategic area of video 
delivery for the service provider market segment, which industry analysts' believe to be approx. $10b market 
opportunity by 2009. 10. In combination with the strong consumer market position through Linksys, the Co. 
expects to now have a more complete portfolio for the digital home. 1. In particular, the Co.'s abilities to create a 
unified home network with SFA's set-top boxes, and Linksys network entertainment product provide CSCO with a 
unique differentiation in the consumer market segment. 3. Deal Highlights: 1. The purchase price for SFA was 
approx. $6.9b or $43 per outstanding share in cash. 2. After removing the net cash from SFA's balance sheet, the 
net purchase price is $5.3b. 3. The Co. expects the acquisition to be: 1. Neutral to its pro forma earnings in FY06. 
2. Slightly accretive to pro forma earnings in FY07, and financed with a combination of cash and debt. 4. SFA's 
current estimated growth rate according to industry analysts' is 10-12%. 5. After the combination and including 
synergies brought by CSCO, there is the potential with the appropriate caveat as outlined to grow between 
12-16%, compounded annual growth from FY07 to FY10 for the area of video that SFA is focused on. 6. The 
acquisition has been accrued by the Board of Directors of each co., and is subject to various closing conditions. 7. 
CSCO expects the acquisition of SFA to close during its 3Q06 subject to regulatory approval. 8. Upon the close, 
SFA is expected to join CSCO's routing and service provider technology group, under the leadership of SVP Mike 
Volpi. 9. On 11/17/05, the Co. shared with appropriate confidentiality commitment of the announcement with two 
major US service providers, and one European service provider. 1. They were very direct in saying that this 
combination makes tremendous sense, and brings a unique excitement to the industry. 2. In various ways, each 
of them articulated how this combination represents the potential to uniquely position CSCO from an architectural 
perspective for both service providers and the consumer. 
S2. Additional Highlights (J.M.) 1. Highlights: 1. The announcement on 11/18/05 of the agreement to SFA be 
acquired by CSCO is a landmark event in its history. 2. The combined strengths and resources of the two 
companies will position to address more quickly the growing number of opportunities in served markets. 1. More 
rapid time to market, and a broader base of new products and systems will benefit all of the stakeholders with 
particular emphasis on customers, employees, and shareholders. 2. Decision Process: 1. The markets that SFA 
serves has been changing rapidly and it believes the rate of change will accelerate. 2. The Co. expects a variety 
of inter-related changes. 1. Technology advantages will make new products available. 2. Customers' markets will 
consolidate. 3. Bundling of many services, including video, will become increasingly important to all of the 
customers. 3. Over the past 12 years, SFA has seen tremendous amount of consolidation among the cable 
operators. 1. Today, two top cable operators serve more than 30m subscribers. 2. During this consolidation, 
technology has changed rapidly, allowing the customers to offer new services. 3. Cable customers are now 
moving to new network architectures to allow the delivery of video, high-speed data, and voice services over a 
converged network. 4. At the same time, telephone companies are entering the entertainment market, and are 
offering a bundle of video, data, and voice services. 1. These customers want more complete integrated solutions 
from fewer vendors. 2. This rapid change in technology can be seen in SFA's newest products. 3. SFA offers hard 
drives and modems in set-tops and cable modems now can support both data and voice services. 4. Soon, SFA 
expects to have DVD burners available in the digital video recorders. 5. This dynamic environment generates a 
tremendous amount of potential for SFA. 5. However, SFA needs a greater in resources to capture the 
opportunities and the expanding markets. 6. As a result, SFA has evaluated a variety of opportunities to: 1. 
Identify a combination that would provide the most value to the shareholders. 2. Enable to provide a broader set 
of products to meet customers expanding need. 3. Leverage complementary technologies 4. At the same time, 
have compatible corporate cultures. 4. CSCO and SFA have achieved tremendous technical leadership and 
strong positions in their respective markets. 1. The combined skills and experience of CSCO and SFA positions 
uniquely to provide the products and systems not only for today's architectures, but also for the next-generation 
architectures that the customers are planning and beginning to implement. 5. The worldwide markets served by 
the companies are growing in large. 1. Together, SFA can offer complete solutions to the customers for their 
integrated intelligent networks and customer premise equipment including home networking. 2. The customers 
will be able to enhance their competitive position by taking advantage of the cost effective end-to-end solutions. 6.

Both companies' cultures are compatible. 1. Both companies lead with technology and have strong engineering 
oriented environments. 2. Both companies recognize that their long success is related to the ability to serve their 
customers very well. 3. Both companies are committed to the health and wealth for their employees and the 
quality of life in the communities, which they operate. 7. SFA believes that this transaction is beneficial to its 
shareholders. 1. This transactions offers $43 per share or approx. $6.9b, representing a 28% premium over the 
closing price on Oct. 27. 8. On an enterprise basis, which is adjusted for cash and short-term investments net of 
debt on SFA's balance sheet, the premium vs. closing price on Oct. 27 is approx. 40%. 3. Calculation: 1. In 
calculating the premium, the Co. began with the stock price on Oct. 27. 2. The closing price of the stock on Oct. 
27 was $33.62, reflecting the sum of two components. 1. The operation of SFA would generate financial results 
on an ongoing basis. 2. The cash and short-term investments net of debt. 3. If the cash and short-term 
investments net of debt represent approx. $10 per share, the operation of the Co. was valued at approx. $23.62 
share. 1. This was the enterprise value on Oct. 27. 3. Similar to this, CSCO offered $43 per share and valued the 
operation of SFA at approx. $33. 1. The difference between the two amounts represent approx. $10 of cash and 
short-term investments. 2. The enterprise value premium of this transaction is the difference in value between the 
enterprise value of the offer and the enterprise value on Oct. 27. 3. This difference of $9.38 representing a 
premium of approx. 40%. 4. In the process, SFA selected fairness opinions from three outside parties. 1. Credit 
Suisse First Boston, and Evercore advised SFA on this transaction. 2. Lehman Brothers, which was not otherwise 
involved in the sale. 5. There are a lot of decisions yet to be made and many details that the mgt. teams must 
work out. 1. CSCO is committed to enabling SFA to continue to execute its business plan. 6. President and CEO 
will remain with the Co. for two years, and all of the SFA senior mgt. team has agreed to stay on following of close 
of the transaction. 4. Summary: 1. SFA is taking an extraordinary successful co. and enhancing this prospect for 
continuous success by joining with CSCO. 2. SFA believes that the combination will better enable it to serve its 
existing customers, better position to expand its served markets, and provide a virtually unique set of technical 
capabilities through which it can address the customers needs. 3. SFA believes that the world is full of potential, 
and as part of CSCO, it looks forward to capture those new opportunities. 
QUESTION AND ANSWER SUMMARY 
OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Nikos Theodosopoulos, UBS. 
NIKOS THEODOSOPOULOS, ANALYST, UBS: Well, first of all, let me just say congratulations on what seems to 
be a fair price for both parties and congratulations to Cisco for buying the company with a long history of earnings 
growth in cash flow generation. My question is on the integration, specifically manufacturing and management. 
Scientific-Atlanta does predominantly all its manufacturing. It has a plant in Mexico. Cisco has an outsource 
model. Can you talk about whether you plan on changing that in the near or long-term. Then on management, I 
think I heard Jim say he is going to stay on for a couple of years. I know if I look back at when Motorola bought 
General Instrument, there was a lot of momentum lost in that company in the transition of that in that acquisition. 
Can you talk about how you're going to try to do a good job on the integration between the two companies? 
Thank you. 
JOHN CHAMBERS, PRESIDENT & CEO, CISCO SYSTEMS: Sure. First is I think you started off with exactly the 
right premise. You have got two companies here that see the market evolution almost identical. And they 
complement each other in very unique ways, which we will consolidate as the market consolidates. In terms of the 
teams, as Jim said, all of the senior management has signed up to staying with the combination and secondly, we 
will make no changes in the organization structure for at least one to two years, and may not even at that time. 
In terms of specific manufacturing, our Head of Manufacturing, Angel Mendez and Hector from your all's side are 
down in the manufacturing plant in Mexico at the present time. They are world-class in manufacturing. Our team 
came back and said this was the best manufacturing organization they have seen in Mexico. And a lot of what 
Jim's team does is not individual standalone products. They are very tightly integrated together from their ASICs 
development, to their systems, to their manufacturing, to their consultancy, to their set-top boxes and they have it 
fueled uniquely to make it work. So Nikos, for us to break that part, especially at the beginning, would not make 
any sense at all. 
Secondly, as we have said many times before, we have done world-class acquisitions and 40% plus of our 
management team are from those acquisitions. So Jim has a very broad group of leaders that we've heard an 
awful lot about and we met with this morning and I would expect them not only to stay here at the 
Scientific-Atlanta division within Cisco but for many of them to have, if they're willing to do it, responsibilities well 
beyond this in other segments of Cisco as we move forward. 
I think -- I'm going to ask Jim to comment a little bit on the momentum. I think both of us would anticipate from the 
rumors in the market and questions going on you might lose a little bit of momentum right at the start but we've

Page 68 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
actually seen the reverse from our customers. The few customers that we confidentially bounced this off of last 
night were almost the reserve. I think our biggest challenge, Jim, as we discussed with the leaders today, is to 
prioritize the opportunities. 
We think that you, if we do it right, will see the reserve instead of Jim growing at the 10 to 12% (indiscernible), 
with the appropriate caveats, we think in terms of this opportunity both in the U.S. but also opening up a large 
segment of the international field could potentially change that growth rate from 10 to 12 to 12 to 16 more in the 
traditional rate that we have both seen. Jim, your thoughts? 
JIM MCDONALD, PRESIDENT & CEO, SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA: I think first relative to the manufacturing thing. 
We're quite proud of what the people have built in Juarez and when I came 12 years ago we had ours outsourced 
in Japan and we were losing all the value we were regenerating through the currency transactions. And we had a 
large part of our business that goes into North America and you can imagine the number of trucks and semis that 
have to pull out when you ship 1.1 million, 1.2 million set-tops each quarter. So a lot of the manufacturing strategy 
has got to be based on where your customers are, what you have to get to them. We have a lot of it sourced 
outside in terms of components and parts and most of that is really sourced in the Far East. So manufacturing 
strategies need to be flexible. 
I think on the other point is we have obviously had some distractions with all the publications and things that have 
surrounded this over the last couple of weeks. I am sure, as our organizations go forward, there will be some 
distractions. But if you look at the long-term combination, we have a tremendous potential here to grow the 
business. 
OPERATOR: Steve Kamman, CIBC. 
STEVE KAMMAN, ANALYST, CIBC: I have got two questions. Number one is strategically, as you know, the 
whole set-top box market is undergoing some pretty significant transition probably I think enabled by Cisco trying 
to can opener some of the more proprietary elements of that model. So I guess the question is how are you going 
to manage that transition if you get to more of an open set-top model and that leads into kind of the next element 
of my question, which is while I do agree SFA is a phenomenally well-managed company, you're looking at gross 
margins in the 37, 40% range, operating margins in the 20% range, 17 to 20% range. You guys are obviously 
significantly higher than that. Do you think you can bring SFA up to more of a Cisco like margin model or is this 
going to pull down the margins out of Cisco? I realize it's early in the transaction but this is something you had to 
have thought about. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Okay, Steve. Break it into pieces. We, both Jim and I, do not see the market as evolved as 
individual boxes. We basically see a market where, using the OSI stock as an example, layers one through seven 
come together. Intelligent, at first throughout the network, and then over time the network becoming the platform. 
And I think this really is one more step along that way. 
In terms of the set-top box market, you watch what is there. It's an ASICs product. It's a combination and the 
uniqueness that Scientific-Atlanta brings and this is an art to make video really work well. That was one of the 
lessons that we have learned by talking with service providers and cable companies around the world. It is an art 
to make this work. were. They bring the combination of that to the market. So what customers will pay a premium 
for and there will obviously be different margin models just like there is in our Linksys market where we have 
much lower gross margins and much lower operating expenses. We will go after markets in terms of what is the 
bottom line profit potential and as you begin to provide an end-to-end solution with industry-leading innovation 
and products that integrate together and it would therefore reduce the risk for our customers and increase their 
time to market to get their revenues. For the consumer, less complexity. That actually will increase your margin 
potential in total. 
Do I expect Scientific-Atlanta's margins to come all the way up to Cisco? No, of course not. But do I think, just 
like the Linksys model, you're going to begin to make integration together and I think in total, we will improve our 
joint margins more than we would without the combination to occur. 
JIM MCDONALD: I think the other thing to think about is that what you are really trying to do is drive new services 
to the consumer. And if you think of where storage is for example we do VOD and SVOD and we have new things 
our customers are doing, which allows you to restart a program when you come in 20 minutes late, you can 
restart it. At the same time, you have storage in the device. So you have DVRs and you have a lot of function 
there. So I think what you find is all parts of the model drive each other and some parts of the model have one 
profitability analysis and other parts have a different. I think what you really are going to do is they are going to be 
complementary and drive each other and some pieces will be lower but a lot of other pieces you will drive back in 
the network are much higher profit models.

JOHN CHAMBERS: I agree, Jim. 
OPERATOR: Talli Anni, Merrill Lynch. 
TALLI ANNI, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: My question is Scientific-Atlanta is a great company, great 
execution history but it is a change from the strategy you've said in the past. John, you have said in the past that 
you're going to be looking mostly at acquisitions that are close to the headquarter, small growth companies and 
here you're buying a company that is far from the headquarter. Growth is 10 to 12% rather than the higher growth 
rate you have in your advanced technologies. It is against what you've said in the past. So what led you to take 
this decision to buy a larger company rather than a smaller company? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Well, you are right that our market has traditionally been a combination of 104 companies. 
We've actually had several companies that were in this price range in the 5 to $7 billion that we have done and at 
least one that represented about 20% of our headcount at that point in time. If you look at our focus, we have a 
very firm rule. When you move into markets, you either partner, acquire or develop in the first five to market. Once 
those first five are established by definition, you either partner with them or acquire. 
Video is an integral part of our strategy that must be part of Cisco's competency. And so when, you are right, if 
you look at our five rules of thumb in terms of acquisitions, one of them, geographic proximity, is not matched. But 
the other four actually match very well. It is extremely strategically aligned with how we see the market evolving 
and our vision of that market and the role that we play as data, voice, video converges. So you don't do an 
acquisition, especially of this size, unless it matches very tightly versus the strategy and vision and a sustainable 
differentiation with it. 
Secondly is you create short-term wins for the shareholders, the customers, the employees, essentially the 
employees of the acquired company. We think we have done that very successfully and our chemistry match with 
your people, Jim, is really amazing. We have got a lot of talent here that I'm finding with a group of people that 
understand how I speak with a southern accent. And you are going to find that we will do very well in not just 
retaining the employees but both of our companies have a track record of doing that very effectively. 
Third is the long-term strategic initiative. It opens up to the market in a way that is going to be very difficult for 
competitors to match in terms of how we think this market will evolve and we think these devices will all do data, 
voice, video and mobility integration. And when you bounce this off of our potential customers, there is not a one 
that didn't say this was just an amazing, amazing move and they understand why these two companies will 
uniquely come together. 
The next element that we do look at is similar cultures. It's amazing, when Jim and talked, and it's the same thing 
among our teams, we can almost finish each other sentences about individual customers. What's important to 
them, what's their approach, how do we view them, what do they expect from us, etc.? So our cultures are 
remarkably similar. You do have a geographic proximity issue here. If Jim were in Silicon Valley, it would be five 
out of five. But four out of five isn't bad and I go back to the most basic issue of all probably, which is the first five 
to market are always the leaders long-term. Scientific-Atlanta is number one in our opinion by a very long way, 
not just in products but integration. So that's why we focused on it and I think this will be a very successful 
acquisition. 
If you watch the three or four that have made a difference in our future, the first one, Crescendo, an acquisition, 
which for $10 million of revenue turned out to be billions of dollars in terms of revenue per year now. StrataCom, 
which clearly brought us into the market and it was the largest acquisition we have done at that point in time over 
$5 billion and a lot of headcount. Then the Linksys acquisition, which a year and a half ago led us into the 
consumer market, and now I think the Scientific-Atlanta one that leads us into the video integration. 
So while we have done a lot of acquisitions, I'd really put Scientific-Atlanta in potentially the top four if we both 
execute well. Jim, I don't if you would add to that? 
JIM MCDONALD: I think if you'd look at our customer base, especially all the large customers, I think you would 
find that all of our large customers are very large customers of Cisco. So it starts with we have an enormous 
amount of synergy coming from the customer. So if you start there and you start to move back, I think that we 
deal with very similar technologies. We have similar makeups in how our organizations are structured in terms of 
talent. So I think as you look through the things, there is just a whole lot of things that are very common starting 
all the way with the customer. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I would agree. Next question please.

OPERATOR: Tim Long, Banc of America. 
TIM LONG, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA: Two quick ones if I could. First, John, for you, maybe could you just 
talk a little bit about Cisco's position in cable, fairly diversified. So could you discuss a little bit if this maybe 
causes a disruption in some of your other cable business maybe in some networks that are more driven by 
Motorola. So do you see an impact to the rest of the cable business? And then for Jim, I'd love to get some 
customer thoughts out of you, even if not from discussions in the last 24 hours. I'm sure you've had these 
discussions over the last few years and particularly would love to know if there have been certain examples, 
whether in the U.S. or internationally, where large deals maybe that didn't go your way could have more clearly 
gone your way if you had a more diverse product offering, including what you're going to have to offer now with 
Cisco. Thanks. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: First, Tim, in terms of the cable business, it has been a tremendously successful segment 
for Cisco, not just in terms of revenue. It grew over 30% this last year and as we said in prior conference calls, 
crossed the $1 billion market for Cisco and while Mike is here, I feel very comfortable in speaking for him on this 
one that I clearly expect with the appropriate caveat that they would grow again in excess of 30%. But if you 
watch what this does, this makes end cable an end-to-end solution and this is very similar to what we have done 
in enterprise. So when you think about an enterprise, what we've been very successful on was an architectural 
play where we filled in all the pieces. 
In cable, we have done the exact same thing. You are now in a position where together we are the key leader 
with a very large marketshare and the traditional routing. We are the clear leader in IP telephony. We are the 
leader in mobility and when you look at the cable combinations with companies like Sprint Nextel, you begin to 
realize the leverage from the mobility side of the house. 
Once you add video to that, not just from a product perspective but an integration and tying this all together, 
which Jim's team is amazing at making work, that gives us I think leadership that is very, very unique and I think 
you'll find the cable players, Tim, probably without exception will say this was a tremendous move for them. I 
would expect you would see them move very rapidly in terms of what we can do together. 
I would add just one other issue before I turn it over to Jim, which is we think we can bring a lot together in the 
international community, which has not been a major focus of Scientific-Atlanta up to this time. So whether it is 
in cable or the traditional BTTs, we think that's a large opportunity for us as well. Jim, to you. 
JIM MCDONALD: If you think of the two parts you asked. The first one is I called my largest two customers last 
night because we have confidential relationships with them and we have been friends for a long time and they 
were both very positive on the transaction. They are also very large customers of Cisco today. So they know 
Cisco. They know us very well. So I think if you look at the customer side of this thing, they are quite positive 
because they are interested in speed to market, how they get new services in front of the consumer, how they put 
all of this stuff and integrate it together. As you do this, these things get more complicated and you need more 
depth of resources and you need a lot of different kinds of resources to do it. So they were quite positive. 
Have I lost a deal I should have gotten? Sure. I've lost one and I know specifically why I lost it was because I 
didn't have the ongoing relationship with the customer because as the telephone guys enter the market, we don't 
have that long historical relationship with those guys. Even though we were selected as having the best products, 
we lost the deal because we didn't have the relationship. Having said that, having given up on it, we are about to 
get back in. But especially if you look at the international markets, we don't have the relationships to carry the 
switch digital video internationally. We don't have the telephone relationships. This is clearly an area where we 
can get a lot of acceleration because Cisco has these relationships and we have things we can sell them. We just 
don't have the relationships with the customers. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: It's interesting. One last comment on the cable. Jim touched base with his two largest. I 
touched base with my largest and my largest said, John, this makes tremendous sense for you all together and 
we view you in a different way than we even did before even though you were very strategic before. Thank you, 
Tim. 
OPERATOR: Brantly Thompson, Goldman Sachs. 
BRANTLEY THOMPSON, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: John, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit 
about the growth rate. You had put into two buckets; SFA at 10 to 12% and then potentially 12 to 16%. You 
commented that the non U.S. is part of that opportunity. But could you talk about what things you will be putting in 
place to try to expand that growth rate and when we might see some milestones around that?

Page 71 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Sure. Breaking it into the segments. First of all, we believe that our own market, prior to this 
combination, was going to grow in the 10 to 15% range and we have been very open in our views on that. The 
second part in terms of the approach, if you begin to think about the synergies that you now bring to the telco 
market and to the cable marketplace, those could be pretty substantial for our joint customers today. 
The elements outside the U.S., and remember, Mike, what is it? The majority of our service provider business is 
outside the U.S., 60% and it is growing at a faster rate than inside the U.S. in most of the quarters. Especially in 
the Asia-Pacific and our emerging geographies. So that clearly would be key element. IP/TV will take off. So while 
we are very united in architectural approach in the cable marketplace and they will be really the first service 
providers where we will be providing end-to-end architectures, we are beginning to see the telcos really focused 
on IP/TV and Jim's team has been able to do that in a very unique way in talking to the customers, not mentioning 
the combination when they talked about Scientific-Atlanta. They said this company really gets this and they 
have both the products. But more importantly an integration capability to tie it together. Thank you very much. 
OPERATOR: Alex Henderson, Citigroup. 
ALEX HENDERSON, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the advanced 
technology decision to categorize this as one. It seems a little bit different from what most people would have 
thought was the approach. It almost seems like you're taking existing businesses and slicing them in and calling 
them advanced technologies platforms now. Should we be changing the way we're thinking about that a little bit? 
You are starting with an acquisition here that is fairly sizable, which obviously puts you much further down the 
curve. How should we think about further acquisitions that might launch advanced technologies platforms? 
Should we be viewing this as one of a number of steps to fill out that platform? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I think that would be the right way to do it. I think if you think about advanced technologies, 
you want to think about it as technology market segments that have a potential to be $1 billion business for Cisco 
that we think we can maintain if we execute right a sustainable differentiation that our target is 40% plus 
marketshare as we move into those, and that it fits in and could be integrated with our other advanced 
technologies in our core routing and switching. Scientific-Atlanta clearly hits all those elements. 
We will use emerging technologies and we've announced two of them already this year as if you think about it 
internal development, in terms of opportunities that may develop in advanced technologies. And when they 
become advanced, we then will focus the resources of the whole company on them. But our movement the other 
day with the Linksys One approach and our movement today, we will announce one more yet this year probably 
at the analysts meeting in terms of a ninth advanced technology; really speaks to movement into new markets 
that we believe will integrate tightly over time into our strategy. If we do our job right, you will see us just continue 
to generate those. I don't expect them all to be successful, although I know this one will. But we will take some of 
the risk in other advanced technologies as we move forward. 
ALEX HENDERSON: If I might follow on with that. Historically, you talk about integration risk as a major concern 
about doing larger acquisitions. If you've got this fairly sizable acquisition to integrate, should we anticipate that 
that would diminish the probability of a similar approach in the near-term at least? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Let me answer that question indirectly. I don't have -- I don't normally do what I call 
medium-sized acquisitions. We have done two or three of them in the past. We may do some of them in the 
future. We don't believe in real large acquisitions. 5000 of Jim's people are in the manufacturing arena, about 
2000 are in the professional service engineering arena, etc. So for 2000 engineers, I don't view this as a large 
acquisition in the sense that is going to take a huge amount of time to get the groups working effectively. 
The fact that we're keeping it as an independent division reporting to Mike and the service provider strategy 
speaks to the importance of not losing momentum as we move forward in this arena. But I think, just like our 
sampling of acquisitions that we have done over the last 12 years has been in a range that this one very much fits 
into, the majority of them will continue to be small acquisitions, privately held, 100 engineers being ideal. But, 
Alex, what we will never violate is once a market starts to go, we see the market transition occurring, if we are not 
in the first five there on our own internal development, we will either partner or acquire one of the first five. This 
video is way to important to me and to Jim to do this in a partnership type of arrangement. So I think you'll find 
that they will fit in very, very tightly in terms of the direction. 
JIM MCDONALD: I think one of the things you will see as a trend is customers are going to continue to reduce the 
number of vendors that they have and the reason is that the integration of these things is the critical element and 
the more vendors you bring to the table, the more difficult the integration problem is. So I think anyone that can 
come to market with a complete set of solutions is going to make this an awful lot easier for the customers.

JOHN CHAMBERS: It's basically as those products are at first loosely coupled together and then tightly coupled 
together. So this is right down the sweet spot. It's what we said we were going to do for a decade; data, voice, 
video converging with mobility. We think time will tell if we're right but we think it is a huge move both in the 
service provider and in the consumer marketplace. But looking out two to four years, I think we will also expand it 
in our enterprise direction. Next question please. 
OPERATOR: Bill Becklean, Oppenheimer. 
BILL BECKLEAN, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER: I'd like to pursue the whole notion of increasing 
Scientific-Atlanta's growth rate from 10 to 12 to 12 to 16 and that is -- it strikes me as the entire market for 
Scientific-Atlanta's products isn't growing 12 to 16. So what you're talking about is trying to drive an entire 
market, not just take share, to get Scientific-Atlanta's growth rate up and that follows into my more important 
question and that is when I'm looking at your advanced technology initiatives, most of those have had very high 
growth rates associated with them. Are you telling us here that there are no billion dollar opportunities out there 
that are going to be growing north of 15% that can drive your top-line growth in the future? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: It's the reverse of that, Bill and thank you for the question that I know may be on people's 
mind. First the advanced technology that we announced, the Linksys One, is a super high-growth marketplace 
and they will start small but the growth rates from those companies, as we have seen in other areas, if they are 
successful is, in the early phases, in the 50 to 100 maybe even 200% type of ranges year-over-year. As you 
begin to look at driving an entire market, I'd just like to qualify that by saying think about Scientific-Atlanta, 75% 
of your business here in the U.S., 25% outside the U.S. So you have the majority of the world for their products at 
the present time had not gotten the penetration and we had the relationships in these key service providers from 
the BTs, to the DTs, to the Telefonicas, to Telecom Italias, the emerging markets, the Telstras, the areas in India, 
etc. So we actually see this as a major opportunity to gain a larger share of that $10 billion market looking out let's 
say by 2009, 2010 from the 2 billion that Scientific-Atlanta has. 
The synergies will also tie, that if we do our job right, we will sell more of our product and the combination will 
allow us to get higher gross margins and also improve dramatically the services and profitability our partners 
have. So I think you'll see us do both. You'll see us enter certain markets that are very strategic to us that are 
growing in more our traditional growth rates and we think we can accelerate those by a combination. You'll 
continue to see us enter a number of markets that are new and have rapid growth but will probably be material 
looking out two to five years and then you will see us continue to drive our current advanced technologies, which 
I'm very pleased with. They grew about 25% quarter-over-quarter this last quarter. So it will be a combination of 
all the above and Bill, thank you for the clarification question. 
OPERATOR: Mark Sue, RBC Capital Markets. 
MARK SUE, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Can you just give us some further specifics on execution and 
management, on senior management commitments? How do you prevent Scientific-Atlanta from becoming 
another Sailent (ph)? And separately, if I look at end-to-end video, it still seems we're missing some elements for 
IP/TV. How much more do you need to spend on video and how much do you need to spend on mobility? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I'm going to divide the question between Jim and I. One of the things that Jim does 
extremely well is this culture here is one of very much an employee family. Their loyalty and their turnover is 
actually even better than Cisco which we run, as you all know, 4% voluntary. We also have done a remarkable 
job. Some of the acquisitions, we've held all managers for nearly a decade. Some of the others we've had a little 
bit more turnover. But if you watch our turnover of our acquired companies, in total they only run about 4%. So 
the first thing you look at in terms of the Company as to the strategicness to you is can you hold the key leaders 
and can you hold the key engineers and salespeople, etc. 
Jim and I are very comfortable with our ability to do that, and actually the team has signed up to very fair 
contracts both ways. So it really is based upon trust but also willing to put the financial commitments behind their 
commitment along that line. Jim, you know your team here, and I am very comfortable about their commitment, 
but maybe if you could expand on that. 
JIM MCDONALD: Well, I think if you not only think of the top management but if you think of the whole company, 
generally this is a company where people come to work and they stay here. We don't have much turnover. I'm on 
my 13th year here, and when I go to the staff meeting, I'm the youngest one in the history of the company in 
terms of employment. So all of the people that basically work for me have been here before I got here. And if we 
look at all of our people across the organization, they have a tremendous loyalty not only to the company but to 
the customers we work with and to each other. So it wasn't very difficult to get the people to say, look, we want to 
stay part of this.

Page 73 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
I think the other part is we share a common vision of where this is going. And it is a lot easier when you've got 
people all linked in to where they're going and they have a common view of this to keep them going in that 
direction. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: The interesting thing, Mark, as we work through this transaction, you learn more about 
people under stress from both sides than any other time before. While I kidded earlier about having people to talk 
like I do in terms of the southern accent, it was the ability of both of our teams at all levels to work through issues 
with an unusual candidness, but yet a trust and building. And the relationships got stronger and stronger 
throughout this as opposed to what normally occurs in terms of getting frayed the reverse way. 
Mike, just maybe very quickly on IP/TV and mobility, the thoughts? 
MIKE VOLPI, SVP & GENERAL MANAGER, CISCO SYSTEMS: Sure. A couple of quick comments that I would 
make on both IP/TV and your question about mobility. First, you have to realize as was clear in John and Jim's 
comments earlier that a part of the video market is, of course, an existing market, which is where the cable 
operators plan. But part of the video market is clearly a brand-new market segment that comes about by the 
delivery of video over DSL infrastructure or fiber infrastructure, high-speed, telco, broadband infrastructure. This 
is a massive market segment, and as is clear, the video expertise which is brought to the table by the 
Scientific-Atlanta team is quite unique. Video is a systems solution, meaning that you really can't put it together 
in a way in which customers and consumers are accustomed to without interlinking the key components together 
in a systematic approach. And that knowledge base is extremely critical for a lot of the newer customers such as 
the telcos that don't really have a deep amount of experience to that area today. So we think that this IP/TV is a 
huge opportunity for the combined companies, both domestically as well as internationally, where Cisco has a 
great deal of coverage. 
In terms of the question about mobility, and mobility is a huge field and has a lot of opportunity, I would cite a 
couple of areas where I think there is some relevance here. First of all, as you might imagine with broadband 
inside homes comes WiFi, and as WiFi becomes increasingly a distribution mechanism within the home, the 
importance of tying that together with a central location in the home which can be thought of as the set-top box 
location, is something that we think we have a very interesting opportunity to pursue here and do some good 
things with. The other piece is that we do think that long-term, video comes about on terminal devices, on 
handsets, on other new kinds of devices which some might be made by Linksys and some might be made by 
others, but the delivery of video to those devices is again a systems level approach. It's not just about catching a 
stream and showing it on this smaller device or this portable device, but it is about plugging together the pieces 
so the consumer experience can be held together. 
Again, that's where a great deal of Scientific-Atlanta systems level experience can be brought to bear and 
differentiate the combined companies in the marketplace. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Next question, please. 
OPERATOR: Christin Armacost with SG Cowen. 
CHRISTIN ARMACOST, ANALYST, SG COWEN: Two questions. First, can you talk about how you plan to 
integrate the Linksys division with Scientific-Atlanta? I believe Linksys did acquire a set-top box like technology 
called KISS. And then secondly with respect to the U.S. market specifically, there has been a lot of deals already 
announced for the quadruple play from the telcos. So do you think this acquisition today could change any of the 
deals already announced? Thank you. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Jim, I'm going to ask you to answer that second one, but without saying specific names of 
customers, as we both know every one of these in the U.S. It will absolutely be a huge opportunity for us outside 
the U.S. as we capitalize on it. Right time will tell if we can do that or not. In terms of Linksys and 
Scientific-Atlanta and Cisco core routing and switching, we will over time tightly couple the architectures 
together on that. I look at Linksys with the KISS acquisition not as a set-top acquisition at all, but moving 
intelligence into DVDs and moving intelligence throughout the market. But if it goes to the extent that we hope 
that it will, that you will be able to manage, download information, service, etc., electronic devices in the home 
through a Linksys portal. 
So our intent from the time we bought Linksys all the way through was not only to move down market into the 
consumer entertainment and total communications of data, voice, video with mobility, but also to move up market 
to where the service providers could use the Linksys products, uniquely manage them, roll them out to the 
consumer, and what we announced this last week, even to the low-end of small to medium-size business. In 
terms of a little bit of product overlap, that is normal in a marketplace, and I don't think it will be a distraction at all.

Page 74 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
But I see Linksys being separate from Scientific-Atlanta, and both of those separate from our core direction on 
routing and switching to other advanced technologies. 
Jim, maybe your thoughts about customer markets here. And I know we can almost finish each other's sentences 
with the customers here in terms of what opportunities may be, but without getting too specific in a way that might 
get us in trouble with them. 
JIM MCDONALD: Well, on our last conference call I told people that we were in possession of material 
information and we weren't able to buy our stock, and everybody is going to conclude that this was that. Well, 
there's actually more than that. There's other things out there, so our hope is that we are going to want a piece of 
all the major telephone players. So some announced, some not announced. The key for this is that you've got to 
go in and build the relationship with them. You have got to go -- really figure out exactly where they want to go, 
and most of these customers all want something a little bit different. It's all built off of the same core technology, 
but you have to package it a little bit differently. 
So I think what you find is that as you build these relationships, there is an opportunity to do more and more for 
these customers. And if you look at the capital budgets of a couple of guys, they're almost as large as the whole 
cable industry by themselves individually. So it is a huge opportunity to supply these guys, and you never give up 
on them. You've just got to keep going back. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I think Jim and I both enjoy selling, but more importantly we enjoy developing relationships 
which last to make a difference in the market. So I think you'll see this expertise go into the telco market pretty 
effectively. 
JIM MCDONALD: If we add value, they'll do business with us. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Next question please, operator. 
OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question. Cisco Systems and Scientific-Atlanta invite you 
to a business and technical overview of this announcement at 11:00 AM Eastern time today. Telephone 
information and webcast access can be found on both companies' Web pages. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Operator, let me just close on behalf of Jim and I and our employees and our shareholders 
and our customers, we thank you for the time we spent with you today. We really think this offers a very unique 
opportunity in a marketplace and a chance to really, I think, lead in this next market transition on their quadruple 
play, but also really focus initially on the service provider and the consumer. So thank you very much for joining 
us. Jim, it's going to be fun working together. 
JIM MCDONALD: And I would also like to thank you for joining us. I would certainly pass along to all our 
employees that we're certainly proud of all the things we have done and all the things that we're going to be able 
to do together in the future. And we will get around to see all the customers as soon as we can. We know that 
you'll have a lot of questions, but we will get there very quickly and we'll be talking to you today and tomorrow -- 
today and Monday. So thank you for joining us. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Thank you, operator. 
OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 
800-841-4034. For participants dialing from outside the U.S., please dial 203-369-3360. You may disconnect at

OPERATOR: Good morning and welcome to today's Cisco Systems Scientific-Atlanta conference call. 
Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. (OPERATOR 
INSTRUCTIONS). Until then all lines will remain in a listen-only fashion. As a reminder, today's call is being 
recorded at the request of the Company. Should you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I'd 
now like to introduce Ms. Terry Anderson, Director of Corporate Public Relations of Cisco Systems. Ma'am, you 
may begin. 
TERRY ANDERSON, DIRECTOR CORPORATE PR, CISCO SYSTEMS: Good morning, everyone and welcome 
to our conference call announcing Cisco's definitive agreement to acquire Scientific-Atlanta of Lawrenceville, 
Georgia. This is Terry Anderson of Corporate Communications at Cisco Systems and I'm here with John 
Chambers, President and CEO; Mike Volpi, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Routing and Service 
Provider Technology Group; and Ned Hooper, Vice President of Corporate Business Development. Also with us 
is Scientific-Atlanta President and CEO, Jim McDonald, and Tom Robey, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Over the next fifteen minutes, John and Jim will discuss the Scientific-Atlanta acquisition we are announcing 
today. A 20 to 30 minute question and answer period will follow. A press release with information on today's 
announcement can be found on First Call, Full National Business Wire, the European Business and Technical 
Wire and on the Cisco website at www.Cisco.com . A replay of the Cisco Scientific-Atlanta conference call will 
be available from 11 AM Eastern time on November 18, 2005 to 8 PM Eastern time on November 23, 2005 at 
800-841-4034 in the United States and 203-369-3360 internationally. The replay is also available on the Cisco 
Investor Relations website at www.Cisco.com/go/investors . 
The matters both companies will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject 
to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most 
recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that 
could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Unauthorized 
recording of this conference call is not permitted and now I would like to turn the call over to John Chambers. 
JOHN CHAMBERS, PRESIDENT & CEO, CISCO SYSTEMS: Terry, thank you very much and good morning, 
everyone. In today's call, it will be my pleasure to partner with my counterpart from Scientific-Atlanta, Jim 
McDonald. We will cover the following topics. First, Cisco's overall vision and strategy for the service provider 
and consumer market segments as data, voice, video and mobility converge. Second, how Scientific-Atlanta, 
the industry leader in video products and expertise, fits into that strategy and vision. Third, Scientific-Atlanta's 
view on the marketplace evolution and reasons for this combination with Cisco and finally, Jim and I will be 
honored to have a good Q&A with each of you. 
First let me begin by saying that today's announcement represents much more than an exciting opportunity for 
Cisco. It literally completes a large part of our quadruple play as data, voice, video and mobility converge. In 
many industry analysts' perspective, Cisco is in the leadership position for sustainable differentiation in data, 
voice and mobility convergence. Today's announcement is a major move in completing the fourth element, which 
is video leadership. 
Our strategy has clearly been that intelligence will be distributed throughout the network and that the network will 
eventually become the platform of the future. We believe that layers one through seven of the OSI stock will at 
first be loosely and then tightly coupled together with all elements encompassing the convergence of data, voice, 
video and mobility. The future service provider and consumer markets will in our opinion require intelligence, 
application, storage, processors and services resin (ph) throughout the network. We believe that today's 
acquisition extends our commitment and leadership in both the service provider and consumer market segments. 
As we said in Q1 earnings call just last week, the service provider market segment is approximately 25% of our 
total product business while the consumer market segment is approximately 4%. Both are key drivers for future

Page 77 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
growth opportunities. The market opportunities represented by this announcement will become the eighth 
advanced technology in the area that we will call for today digital video. As a reminder, our current seven 
advanced technologies include home networking, enterprise IP communications, optical networking, security, 
storage area networking, wireless and, as we announced this past Monday, our host of small-business systems 
or linked as one direction. 
Video is emerging as a key element in the service provider quadruple play bundle encompassing consumer 
entertainment, communications and online services. In fact, video may be the most critical element in this bundle 
for ensuring consumer differentiation and loyalty or stickiness if you will to service providers. The opportunity for 
Cisco is to dramatically reduce the complexity of converging data, voice, video over IP in both a fixed and mobile 
environment, which is at the core of our expertise. 
As we have been saying for several years, an integrated architecture is, in our opinion, the only way to reduce 
this complexity. Our experience in this market has shown that the more you provide an end-to-end solution to 
service providers and to the consumer, the greater your likelihood of gaining a larger share of the capital 
expenditures. For example, this integrated end-to-end approach allows service providers to rapidly and cost 
effectively deploy new services. 
From a consumer market perspective, we believe that it is the consumer view that is driving the next wave of 
application in the home and therefore the infrastructure of the future must evolve to enable consumers to 
personalize their experiences with data, voice, video and mobility. Cisco has a broad reach in three of these key 
areas that make up the quadruple play for service providers; data, voice and mobility. And Scientific, in our 
opinion, is the leader in the fourth area, video. 
They have touched directly approximately 50 million consumers. With this acquisition, Cisco offers an end-to-end 
quadruple play in the service provider market segment and expands the quad play in the consumer market. In our 
opinion, Scientific-Atlanta brings the broadest reaching combination of video expertise in the market ranging 
from the set-top boxes to transmission networks and the professional services to both deliver and remake video 
work uniquely for the fourth solution. 
As we've said many times, we believe the industry in which Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta participate will 
consolidate. And that innovation will continue to be through internal development, acquisitions and partnerships. 
For companies to lead both from an innovation and a marketshare perspective, they must be able to do all three 
in our opinion. 
Video entertainment is becoming increasingly digital and on demand with rapid global adoption of high-definition 
TV and digital video recording driving the migration to IP-centric platforms. Cable operators are entering the 
network and set-top box upgrade cycle and telcos are building out new infrastructure for delivery of video 
entertainment. 
Scientific-Atlanta totals approximately 6% of Cisco's current market capitalization but it immediately positions 
Cisco as an end-to-end leader in a key strategic area of video delivery for the service provider market segment, 
which industry analysts believe to be approximately a 10 billion market opportunity by 2009. In combination with 
our strong consumer market position through Linksys, we will now have a more complete portfolio for the digital 
home. In particular, our ability to create a unified home network for Scientific-Atlanta set-top boxes and Linksys 
network entertainment products provides Cisco with a unique differentiation in the consumer market segment. 
I would like to now offer more details surrounding the deal. The purchase price for Scientific-Atlanta was 
approximately $6.9 billion or $43 per outstanding share in cash. After removing the net cash on 
Scientific-Atlanta's balance sheet, the net purchase price is 5.3 billion. It is premature to discuss the financial 
impact after the close but we expect the acquisition to be neutral to Cisco's pro forma earnings in FY '06 to be 
slightly accretive to pro forma earnings in FY '07 and financed with a combination of cash and debt. 
Scientific-Atlanta's current estimated growth rate according to industry analysts is 10 to 12%. After the 
combination and including synergies brought by Cisco, there is the potential with the appropriate caveat as 
outlined in our forward-looking statements to grow between 12 and 16% compounded annual growth rate from FY 
'07 to FY '10 for the area of video that Scientific-Atlanta is focused on. 
The acquisition has been approved by the Board of Directors of each company and is subject to various closing 
conditions. When this acquisition closes, we will cover in more detail the financial model and expected financial 
impact. We expect the acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta to close during Cisco's Q3 FY '06 but is subject to 
regulatory approval. Upon the close, Scientific-Atlanta will join Cisco's routing and service provider technology

group under the leadership of Senior Vice President, Mike Volpi, supporting Cisco's efforts in the service provider 
market segment. 
I have always believed that the driver of your vision and strategy should be your customers, and as such, solicit 
(ph) tests for all major strategies or acquisition decisions are those same customers. Yesterday evening I shared 
with the appropriate confidentiality commitment today's announcements with two major U.S. service providers and 
one European service provider. The reactions were very similar and could be summarized in the following way. 
First, they were very direct in saying this combination makes tremendous sense and brings a unique excitement 
to the industry. And in various ways each of them articulated how this combination represents the potential to 
uniquely position Cisco from an architectural perspective for both service providers and the consumer. 
And now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim McDonald, President and CEO of Scientific-Atlanta. Jim, 
welcome to the Cisco team. 
JIM MCDONALD, PRESIDENT & CEO, SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA: Thank you, John. Good morning and I'd also like 
to thank you for joining us this morning. Today's announcement of our agreement to be acquired by Cisco 
Systems is a landmark event in the history of Scientific-Atlanta. The combined strengths and resources of our 
two companies will position us to address more quickly the growing number of opportunities in the markets we 
serve. More rapid time to market and a broader base of new products and systems will benefit all of our 
stakeholders with particular emphasis on customers, employees and our shareholders. I want to briefly share with 
you the process by which we came to this decision and our strong belief that this transaction is the right course 
for both Scientific-Atlanta and Cisco. 
The markets we serve have been changing rapidly and we believe the rate of change will accelerate. We expect a 
variety of interrelated changes. Technology advances will make new products available. Our customers' markets 
will consolidate and bundling of many services, including video, will become increasingly important to all of our 
customers. Over the past twelve years, we have seen tremendous amount of consolidation among cable 
operators. Today, two top cable operators serve more than 30 million subscribers. During this consolidation, 
technology has changed rapidly allowing our customers to offer new services. 
Our cable customers are now moving to new network architectures to allow the delivery of video, high-speed data 
and voice services over a converged network. At the same time, telephone companies are entering the 
entertainment market by offering a bundle of video, data and voice services. These customers want more 
complete, integrated solutions from fewer vendors. 
This rapid change in technology can be seen in our newest products. We offer hard drives and modems and 
set-tops and cable modems now can support both data and voice services. Soon we will have DVD burners 
available in our digital video recorders. This dynamic environment generates a tremendous amount of potential 
for us. However, we need a greater scope in resources to capture the opportunities in the expanding markets. 
As a result, we have evaluated a variety of opportunities to identify a combination that would provide the most 
value to our shareholders, would enable us to provide a broader set of products to meet customers expanding 
needs and would leverage complementary technologies and at the same time would have compatible corporate 
cultures. The clear answer to us is Cisco Systems. Both Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta have achieved 
tremendous technical leadership in strong positions in their respective markets. 
The combined skills and experience of Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta's positions position us uniquely to provide 
the products and systems, not only for today's architectures, but also for the next generation architectures that our 
customers are planning and beginning to implement. The worldwide markets served by our companies are 
growing in large. Together, we can offer complete solutions to our customers for their integrated intelligent 
networks and customer premise equipment, including home networking. Our customers will be able to enhance 
their competitive position by taking advantage of our cost-effective, end-to-end solutions. 
Our company cultures are compatible. Both companies lead with technology and have strong 
engineering-oriented environments. Both companies recognize that their long-term success is related to the ability 
to serve their customers very well. And both companies are committed to the health and welfare of their 
employees and the quality of life in the communities in which they operate. We believe that this transaction is 
beneficial to our shareholders. Cisco's offer of $43 per share or approximately $6.9 billion represents a 28% 
premium over the closing price on October 27th before rumors of the sale began to appear in a number of 
publications.

Page 79 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
On an enterprise basis, which adjusts for cash and short-term investments net of debt on our balance sheet, the 
premium compared to closing price on October 27th is approximately 40%. Let me explain the calculation to you. 
In calculating the premium, we began with the stock price on October 27th. The closing price of our stock on that 
day was $33.62 reflecting the sum of two components. First, the operation of the Company, which generates 
financial results on an ongoing basis and second, our cash and short-term investments net of debt. 
Since our cash and short-term investments net of debt represents approximately $10 per share, the operations of 
the Company were valued at approximately $23.62 per share. This was the enterprise value on October 27th. 
Similarly, the Cisco offer of $43 per share values the operation of our Company at approximately $33. The 
difference between the two amounts represents our approximate $10 of cash and short-term investments. The 
enterprise value premium of this transaction is the difference in value between the enterprise value of the offer 
and the enterprise value on October 27th. This difference of $9.38 represents a premium of approximately 40%. 
In the process, we solicit fairness opinions from three outside parties; Credit Suisse First Boston, Evercore, both 
of which advised us on this transaction and Lehman Brothers, which was not otherwise involved in the sale. As 
you might expect, there are a lot of decisions yet to be made and many details that the management teams must 
work out. One thing however is clear. Cisco is committed to enabling Scientific-Atlanta to continue to execute its 
business plan. I will remain with the Company for two years and all of our senior management team have agreed 
to stay on following the close of the transaction. 
Our customers and employees should have no doubt of Cisco's commitment that we will not compromise the 
service and innovation that contributes to our customers' success and provide a dynamic and rewarding 
workplace for our employees. 
In summary, we are taking an extraordinary successful company and enhancing its prospects for continued 
success by joining with Cisco Systems. We believe that the combination will better able us to serve our existing 
customers, it will better position us to expand our served markets and it will provide a virtually unique set of 
technical capabilities through which it can address the customers needs. We believe that the world is full of 
potential and, as part of Cisco, we will look forward to capturing those new opportunities. Now we would be 
pleased to take any questions. 
OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Nikos Theodosopoulos, UBS. 
NIKOS THEODOSOPOULOS, ANALYST, UBS: Well, first of all, let me just say congratulations on what seems to 
be a fair price for both parties and congratulations to Cisco for buying the company with a long history of earnings 
growth in cash flow generation. My question is on the integration, specifically manufacturing and management. 
Scientific-Atlanta does predominantly all its manufacturing. It has a plant in Mexico. Cisco has an outsource 
model. Can you talk about whether you plan on changing that in the near or long-term. Then on management, I 
think I heard Jim say he is going to stay on for a couple of years. I know if I look back at when Motorola bought 
General Instrument, there was a lot of momentum lost in that company in the transition of that in that acquisition. 
Can you talk about how you're going to try to do a good job on the integration between the two companies? 
Thank you. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Sure. First is I think you started off with exactly the right premise. You have got two 
companies here that see the market evolution almost identical. And they complement each other in very unique 
ways, which we will consolidate as the market consolidates. In terms of the teams, as Jim said, all of the senior 
management has signed up to staying with the combination and secondly, we will make no changes in the 
organization structure for at least one to two years, and may not even at that time. 
In terms of specific manufacturing, our Head of Manufacturing, Angel Mendez and Hector from your all's side are 
down in the manufacturing plant in Mexico at the present time. They are world-class in manufacturing. Our team 
came back and said this was the best manufacturing organization they have seen in Mexico. And a lot of what 
Jim's team does is not individual standalone products. They are very tightly integrated together from their ASICs 
development, to their systems, to their manufacturing, to their consultancy, to their set-top boxes and they have it 
fueled uniquely to make it work. So Nikos, for us to break that part, especially at the beginning, would not make 
any sense at all. 
Secondly, as we have said many times before, we have done world-class acquisitions and 40% plus of our 
management team are from those acquisitions. So Jim has a very broad group of leaders that we've heard an 
awful lot about and we met with this morning and I would expect them not only to stay here at the 
Scientific-Atlanta division within Cisco but for many of them to have, if they're willing to do it, responsibilities well 
beyond this in other segments of Cisco as we move forward.

I think -- I'm going to ask Jim to comment a little bit on the momentum. I think both of us would anticipate from the 
rumors in the market and questions going on you might lose a little bit of momentum right at the start but we've 
actually seen the reverse from our customers. The few customers that we confidentially bounced this off of last 
night were almost the reserve. I think our biggest challenge, Jim, as we discussed with the leaders today, is to 
prioritize the opportunities. 
We think that you, if we do it right, will see the reserve instead of Jim growing at the 10 to 12% (indiscernible), 
with the appropriate caveats, we think in terms of this opportunity both in the U.S. but also opening up a large 
segment of the international field could potentially change that growth rate from 10 to 12 to 12 to 16 more in the 
traditional rate that we have both seen. Jim, your thoughts? 
JIM MCDONALD: I think first relative to the manufacturing thing. We're quite proud of what the people have built 
in Juarez and when I came 12 years ago we had ours outsourced in Japan and we were losing all the value we 
were regenerating through the currency transactions. And we had a large part of our business that goes into 
North America and you can imagine the number of trucks and semis that have to pull out when you ship 1.1 
million, 1.2 million set-tops each quarter. So a lot of the manufacturing strategy has got to be based on where 
your customers are, what you have to get to them. We have a lot of it sourced outside in terms of components 
and parts and most of that is really sourced in the Far East. So manufacturing strategies need to be flexible. 
I think on the other point is we have obviously had some distractions with all the publications and things that have 
surrounded this over the last couple of weeks. I am sure, as our organizations go forward, there will be some 
distractions. But if you look at the long-term combination, we have a tremendous potential here to grow the 
business. 
OPERATOR: Steve Kamman, CIBC. 
STEVE KAMMAN, ANALYST, CIBC: I have got two questions. Number one is strategically, as you know, the 
whole set-top box market is undergoing some pretty significant transition probably I think enabled by Cisco trying 
to can opener some of the more proprietary elements of that model. So I guess the question is how are you going 
to manage that transition if you get to more of an open set-top model and that leads into kind of the next element 
of my question, which is while I do agree SFA is a phenomenally well-managed company, you're looking at gross 
margins in the 37, 40% range, operating margins in the 20% range, 17 to 20% range. You guys are obviously 
significantly higher than that. Do you think you can bring SFA up to more of a Cisco like margin model or is this 
going to pull down the margins out of Cisco? I realize it's early in the transaction but this is something you had to 
have thought about. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Okay, Steve. Break it into pieces. We, both Jim and I, do not see the market as evolved as 
individual boxes. We basically see a market where, using the OSI stock as an example, layers one through seven 
come together. Intelligent, at first throughout the network, and then over time the network becoming the platform. 
And I think this really is one more step along that way. 
In terms of the set-top box market, you watch what is there. It's an ASICs product. It's a combination and the 
uniqueness that Scientific-Atlanta brings and this is an art to make video really work well. That was one of the 
lessons that we have learned by talking with service providers and cable companies around the world. It is an art 
to make this work. were. They bring the combination of that to the market. So what customers will pay a premium 
for and there will obviously be different margin models just like there is in our Linksys market where we have 
much lower gross margins and much lower operating expenses. We will go after markets in terms of what is the 
bottom line profit potential and as you begin to provide an end-to-end solution with industry-leading innovation 
and products that integrate together and it would therefore reduce the risk for our customers and increase their 
time to market to get their revenues. For the consumer, less complexity. That actually will increase your margin 
potential in total. 
Do I expect Scientific-Atlanta's margins to come all the way up to Cisco? No, of course not. But do I think, just 
like the Linksys model, you're going to begin to make integration together and I think in total, we will improve our 
joint margins more than we would without the combination to occur. 
JIM MCDONALD: I think the other thing to think about is that what you are really trying to do is drive new services 
to the consumer. And if you think of where storage is for example we do VOD and SVOD and we have new things 
our customers are doing, which allows you to restart a program when you come in 20 minutes late, you can 
restart it. At the same time, you have storage in the device. So you have DVRs and you have a lot of function 
there. So I think what you find is all parts of the model drive each other and some parts of the model have one 
profitability analysis and other parts have a different. I think what you really are going to do is they are going to be

Page 81 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
complementary and drive each other and some pieces will be lower but a lot of other pieces you will drive back in 
the network are much higher profit models. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I agree, Jim. 
OPERATOR: Talli Anni, Merrill Lynch. 
TALLI ANNI, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: My question is Scientific-Atlanta is a great company, great 
execution history but it is a change from the strategy you've said in the past. John, you have said in the past that 
you're going to be looking mostly at acquisitions that are close to the headquarter, small growth companies and 
here you're buying a company that is far from the headquarter. Growth is 10 to 12% rather than the higher growth 
rate you have in your advanced technologies. It is against what you've said in the past. So what led you to take 
this decision to buy a larger company rather than a smaller company? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Well, you are right that our market has traditionally been a combination of 104 companies. 
We've actually had several companies that were in this price range in the 5 to $7 billion that we have done and at 
least one that represented about 20% of our headcount at that point in time. If you look at our focus, we have a 
very firm rule. When you move into markets, you either partner, acquire or develop in the first five to market. Once 
those first five are established by definition, you either partner with them or acquire. 
Video is an integral part of our strategy that must be part of Cisco's competency. And so when, you are right, if 
you look at our five rules of thumb in terms of acquisitions, one of them, geographic proximity, is not matched. But 
the other four actually match very well. It is extremely strategically aligned with how we see the market evolving 
and our vision of that market and the role that we play as data, voice, video converges. So you don't do an 
acquisition, especially of this size, unless it matches very tightly versus the strategy and vision and a sustainable 
differentiation with it. 
Secondly is you create short-term wins for the shareholders, the customers, the employees, essentially the 
employees of the acquired company. We think we have done that very successfully and our chemistry match with 
your people, Jim, is really amazing. We have got a lot of talent here that I'm finding with a group of people that 
understand how I speak with a southern accent. And you are going to find that we will do very well in not just 
retaining the employees but both of our companies have a track record of doing that very effectively. 
Third is the long-term strategic initiative. It opens up to the market in a way that is going to be very difficult for 
competitors to match in terms of how we think this market will evolve and we think these devices will all do data, 
voice, video and mobility integration. And when you bounce this off of our potential customers, there is not a one 
that didn't say this was just an amazing, amazing move and they understand why these two companies will 
uniquely come together. 
The next element that we do look at is similar cultures. It's amazing, when Jim and talked, and it's the same thing 
among our teams, we can almost finish each other sentences about individual customers. What's important to 
them, what's their approach, how do we view them, what do they expect from us, etc.? So our cultures are 
remarkably similar. You do have a geographic proximity issue here. If Jim were in Silicon Valley, it would be five 
out of five. But four out of five isn't bad and I go back to the most basic issue of all probably, which is the first five 
to market are always the leaders long-term. Scientific-Atlanta is number one in our opinion by a very long way, 
not just in products but integration. So that's why we focused on it and I think this will be a very successful 
acquisition. 
If you watch the three or four that have made a difference in our future, the first one, Crescendo, an acquisition, 
which for $10 million of revenue turned out to be billions of dollars in terms of revenue per year now. StrataCom, 
which clearly brought us into the market and it was the largest acquisition we have done at that point in time over 
$5 billion and a lot of headcount. Then the Linksys acquisition, which a year and a half ago led us into the 
consumer market, and now I think the Scientific-Atlanta one that leads us into the video integration. 
So while we have done a lot of acquisitions, I'd really put Scientific-Atlanta in potentially the top four if we both 
execute well. Jim, I don't if you would add to that? 
JIM MCDONALD: I think if you'd look at our customer base, especially all the large customers, I think you would 
find that all of our large customers are very large customers of Cisco. So it starts with we have an enormous 
amount of synergy coming from the customer. So if you start there and you start to move back, I think that we 
deal with very similar technologies. We have similar makeups in how our organizations are structured in terms of 
talent. So I think as you look through the things, there is just a whole lot of things that are very common starting 
all the way with the customer.

Page 82 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I would agree. Next question please. 
OPERATOR: Tim Long, Banc of America. 
TIM LONG, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA: Two quick ones if I could. First, John, for you, maybe could you just 
talk a little bit about Cisco's position in cable, fairly diversified. So could you discuss a little bit if this maybe 
causes a disruption in some of your other cable business maybe in some networks that are more driven by 
Motorola. So do you see an impact to the rest of the cable business? And then for Jim, I'd love to get some 
customer thoughts out of you, even if not from discussions in the last 24 hours. I'm sure you've had these 
discussions over the last few years and particularly would love to know if there have been certain examples, 
whether in the U.S. or internationally, where large deals maybe that didn't go your way could have more clearly 
gone your way if you had a more diverse product offering, including what you're going to have to offer now with 
Cisco. Thanks. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: First, Tim, in terms of the cable business, it has been a tremendously successful segment 
for Cisco, not just in terms of revenue. It grew over 30% this last year and as we said in prior conference calls, 
crossed the $1 billion market for Cisco and while Mike is here, I feel very comfortable in speaking for him on this 
one that I clearly expect with the appropriate caveat that they would grow again in excess of 30%. But if you 
watch what this does, this makes end cable an end-to-end solution and this is very similar to what we have done 
in enterprise. So when you think about an enterprise, what we've been very successful on was an architectural 
play where we filled in all the pieces. 
In cable, we have done the exact same thing. You are now in a position where together we are the key leader 
with a very large marketshare and the traditional routing. We are the clear leader in IP telephony. We are the 
leader in mobility and when you look at the cable combinations with companies like Sprint Nextel, you begin to 
realize the leverage from the mobility side of the house. 
Once you add video to that, not just from a product perspective but an integration and tying this all together, 
which Jim's team is amazing at making work, that gives us I think leadership that is very, very unique and I think 
you'll find the cable players, Tim, probably without exception will say this was a tremendous move for them. I 
would expect you would see them move very rapidly in terms of what we can do together. 
I would add just one other issue before I turn it over to Jim, which is we think we can bring a lot together in the 
international community, which has not been a major focus of Scientific-Atlanta up to this time. So whether it is 
in cable or the traditional BTTs, we think that's a large opportunity for us as well. Jim, to you. 
JIM MCDONALD: If you think of the two parts you asked. The first one is I called my largest two customers last 
night because we have confidential relationships with them and we have been friends for a long time and they 
were both very positive on the transaction. They are also very large customers of Cisco today. So they know 
Cisco. They know us very well. So I think if you look at the customer side of this thing, they are quite positive 
because they are interested in speed to market, how they get new services in front of the consumer, how they put 
all of this stuff and integrate it together. As you do this, these things get more complicated and you need more 
depth of resources and you need a lot of different kinds of resources to do it. So they were quite positive. 
Have I lost a deal I should have gotten? Sure. I've lost one and I know specifically why I lost it was because I 
didn't have the ongoing relationship with the customer because as the telephone guys enter the market, we don't 
have that long historical relationship with those guys. Even though we were selected as having the best products, 
we lost the deal because we didn't have the relationship. Having said that, having given up on it, we are about to 
get back in. But especially if you look at the international markets, we don't have the relationships to carry the 
switch digital video internationally. We don't have the telephone relationships. This is clearly an area where we 
can get a lot of acceleration because Cisco has these relationships and we have things we can sell them. We just 
don't have the relationships with the customers. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: It's interesting. One last comment on the cable. Jim touched base with his two largest. I 
touched base with my largest and my largest said, John, this makes tremendous sense for you all together and 
we view you in a different way than we even did before even though you were very strategic before. Thank you, 
Tim. 
OPERATOR: Brantly Thompson, Goldman Sachs. 
BRANTLEY THOMPSON, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: John, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit 
about the growth rate. You had put into two buckets; SFA at 10 to 12% and then potentially 12 to 16%. You

Page 83 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
commented that the non U.S. is part of that opportunity. But could you talk about what things you will be putting in 
place to try to expand that growth rate and when we might see some milestones around that? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Sure. Breaking it into the segments. First of all, we believe that our own market, prior to this 
combination, was going to grow in the 10 to 15% range and we have been very open in our views on that. The 
second part in terms of the approach, if you begin to think about the synergies that you now bring to the telco 
market and to the cable marketplace, those could be pretty substantial for our joint customers today. 
The elements outside the U.S., and remember, Mike, what is it? The majority of our service provider business is 
outside the U.S., 60% and it is growing at a faster rate than inside the U.S. in most of the quarters. Especially in 
the Asia-Pacific and our emerging geographies. So that clearly would be key element. IP/TV will take off. So while 
we are very united in architectural approach in the cable marketplace and they will be really the first service 
providers where we will be providing end-to-end architectures, we are beginning to see the telcos really focused 
on IP/TV and Jim's team has been able to do that in a very unique way in talking to the customers, not mentioning 
the combination when they talked about Scientific-Atlanta. They said this company really gets this and they 
have both the products. But more importantly an integration capability to tie it together. Thank you very much. 
OPERATOR: Alex Henderson, Citigroup. 
ALEX HENDERSON, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the advanced 
technology decision to categorize this as one. It seems a little bit different from what most people would have 
thought was the approach. It almost seems like you're taking existing businesses and slicing them in and calling 
them advanced technologies platforms now. Should we be changing the way we're thinking about that a little bit? 
You are starting with an acquisition here that is fairly sizable, which obviously puts you much further down the 
curve. How should we think about further acquisitions that might launch advanced technologies platforms? 
Should we be viewing this as one of a number of steps to fill out that platform? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I think that would be the right way to do it. I think if you think about advanced technologies, 
you want to think about it as technology market segments that have a potential to be $1 billion business for Cisco 
that we think we can maintain if we execute right a sustainable differentiation that our target is 40% plus 
marketshare as we move into those, and that it fits in and could be integrated with our other advanced 
technologies in our core routing and switching. Scientific-Atlanta clearly hits all those elements. 
We will use emerging technologies and we've announced two of them already this year as if you think about it 
internal development, in terms of opportunities that may develop in advanced technologies. And when they 
become advanced, we then will focus the resources of the whole company on them. But our movement the other 
day with the Linksys One approach and our movement today, we will announce one more yet this year probably 
at the analysts meeting in terms of a ninth advanced technology; really speaks to movement into new markets 
that we believe will integrate tightly over time into our strategy. If we do our job right, you will see us just continue 
to generate those. I don't expect them all to be successful, although I know this one will. But we will take some of 
the risk in other advanced technologies as we move forward. 
ALEX HENDERSON: If I might follow on with that. Historically, you talk about integration risk as a major concern 
about doing larger acquisitions. If you've got this fairly sizable acquisition to integrate, should we anticipate that 
that would diminish the probability of a similar approach in the near-term at least? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Let me answer that question indirectly. I don't have -- I don't normally do what I call 
medium-sized acquisitions. We have done two or three of them in the past. We may do some of them in the 
future. We don't believe in real large acquisitions. 5000 of Jim's people are in the manufacturing arena, about 
2000 are in the professional service engineering arena, etc. So for 2000 engineers, I don't view this as a large 
acquisition in the sense that is going to take a huge amount of time to get the groups working effectively. 
The fact that we're keeping it as an independent division reporting to Mike and the service provider strategy 
speaks to the importance of not losing momentum as we move forward in this arena. But I think, just like our 
sampling of acquisitions that we have done over the last 12 years has been in a range that this one very much fits 
into, the majority of them will continue to be small acquisitions, privately held, 100 engineers being ideal. But, 
Alex, what we will never violate is once a market starts to go, we see the market transition occurring, if we are not 
in the first five there on our own internal development, we will either partner or acquire one of the first five. This 
video is way to important to me and to Jim to do this in a partnership type of arrangement. So I think you'll find 
that they will fit in very, very tightly in terms of the direction. 
JIM MCDONALD: I think one of the things you will see as a trend is customers are going to continue to reduce the 
number of vendors that they have and the reason is that the integration of these things is the critical element and

Page 84 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
the more vendors you bring to the table, the more difficult the integration problem is. So I think anyone that can 
come to market with a complete set of solutions is going to make this an awful lot easier for the customers. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: It's basically as those products are at first loosely coupled together and then tightly coupled 
together. So this is right down the sweet spot. It's what we said we were going to do for a decade; data, voice, 
video converging with mobility. We think time will tell if we're right but we think it is a huge move both in the 
service provider and in the consumer marketplace. But looking out two to four years, I think we will also expand it 
in our enterprise direction. Next question please. 
OPERATOR: Bill Becklean, Oppenheimer. 
BILL BECKLEAN, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER: I'd like to pursue the whole notion of increasing 
Scientific-Atlanta's growth rate from 10 to 12 to 12 to 16 and that is -- it strikes me as the entire market for 
Scientific-Atlanta's products isn't growing 12 to 16. So what you're talking about is trying to drive an entire 
market, not just take share, to get Scientific-Atlanta's growth rate up and that follows into my more important 
question and that is when I'm looking at your advanced technology initiatives, most of those have had very high 
growth rates associated with them. Are you telling us here that there are no billion dollar opportunities out there 
that are going to be growing north of 15% that can drive your top-line growth in the future? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: It's the reverse of that, Bill and thank you for the question that I know may be on people's 
mind. First the advanced technology that we announced, the Linksys One, is a super high-growth marketplace 
and they will start small but the growth rates from those companies, as we have seen in other areas, if they are 
successful is, in the early phases, in the 50 to 100 maybe even 200% type of ranges year-over-year. As you 
begin to look at driving an entire market, I'd just like to qualify that by saying think about Scientific-Atlanta, 75% 
of your business here in the U.S., 25% outside the U.S. So you have the majority of the world for their products at 
the present time had not gotten the penetration and we had the relationships in these key service providers from 
the BTs, to the DTs, to the Telefonicas, to Telecom Italias, the emerging markets, the Telstras, the areas in India, 
etc. So we actually see this as a major opportunity to gain a larger share of that $10 billion market looking out let's 
say by 2009, 2010 from the 2 billion that Scientific-Atlanta has. 
The synergies will also tie, that if we do our job right, we will sell more of our product and the combination will 
allow us to get higher gross margins and also improve dramatically the services and profitability our partners 
have. So I think you'll see us do both. You'll see us enter certain markets that are very strategic to us that are 
growing in more our traditional growth rates and we think we can accelerate those by a combination. You'll 
continue to see us enter a number of markets that are new and have rapid growth but will probably be material 
looking out two to five years and then you will see us continue to drive our current advanced technologies, which 
I'm very pleased with. They grew about 25% quarter-over-quarter this last quarter. So it will be a combination of 
all the above and Bill, thank you for the clarification question. 
OPERATOR: Mark Sue, RBC Capital Markets. 
MARK SUE, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Can you just give us some further specifics on execution and 
management, on senior management commitments? How do you prevent Scientific-Atlanta from becoming 
another Sailent (ph)? And separately, if I look at end-to-end video, it still seems we're missing some elements for 
IP/TV. How much more do you need to spend on video and how much do you need to spend on mobility? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I'm going to divide the question between Jim and I. One of the things that Jim does 
extremely well is this culture here is one of very much an employee family. Their loyalty and their turnover is 
actually even better than Cisco which we run, as you all know, 4% voluntary. We also have done a remarkable 
job. Some of the acquisitions, we've held all managers for nearly a decade. Some of the others we've had a little 
bit more turnover. But if you watch our turnover of our acquired companies, in total they only run about 4%. So 
the first thing you look at in terms of the Company as to the strategicness to you is can you hold the key leaders 
and can you hold the key engineers and salespeople, etc. 
Jim and I are very comfortable with our ability to do that, and actually the team has signed up to very fair 
contracts both ways. So it really is based upon trust but also willing to put the financial commitments behind their 
commitment along that line. Jim, you know your team here, and I am very comfortable about their commitment, 
but maybe if you could expand on that. 
JIM MCDONALD: Well, I think if you not only think of the top management but if you think of the whole company, 
generally this is a company where people come to work and they stay here. We don't have much turnover. I'm on 
my 13th year here, and when I go to the staff meeting, I'm the youngest one in the history of the company in 
terms of employment. So all of the people that basically work for me have been here before I got here. And if we

Page 85 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
look at all of our people across the organization, they have a tremendous loyalty not only to the company but to 
the customers we work with and to each other. So it wasn't very difficult to get the people to say, look, we want to 
stay part of this. 
I think the other part is we share a common vision of where this is going. And it is a lot easier when you've got 
people all linked in to where they're going and they have a common view of this to keep them going in that 
direction. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: The interesting thing, Mark, as we work through this transaction, you learn more about 
people under stress from both sides than any other time before. While I kidded earlier about having people to talk 
like I do in terms of the southern accent, it was the ability of both of our teams at all levels to work through issues 
with an unusual candidness, but yet a trust and building. And the relationships got stronger and stronger 
throughout this as opposed to what normally occurs in terms of getting frayed the reverse way. 
Mike, just maybe very quickly on IP/TV and mobility, the thoughts? 
MIKE VOLPI, SVP & GENERAL MANAGER, CISCO SYSTEMS: Sure. A couple of quick comments that I would 
make on both IP/TV and your question about mobility. First, you have to realize as was clear in John and Jim's 
comments earlier that a part of the video market is, of course, an existing market, which is where the cable 
operators plan. But part of the video market is clearly a brand-new market segment that comes about by the 
delivery of video over DSL infrastructure or fiber infrastructure, high-speed, telco, broadband infrastructure. This 
is a massive market segment, and as is clear, the video expertise which is brought to the table by the 
Scientific-Atlanta team is quite unique. Video is a systems solution, meaning that you really can't put it together 
in a way in which customers and consumers are accustomed to without interlinking the key components together 
in a systematic approach. And that knowledge base is extremely critical for a lot of the newer customers such as 
the telcos that don't really have a deep amount of experience to that area today. So we think that this IP/TV is a 
huge opportunity for the combined companies, both domestically as well as internationally, where Cisco has a 
great deal of coverage. 
In terms of the question about mobility, and mobility is a huge field and has a lot of opportunity, I would cite a 
couple of areas where I think there is some relevance here. First of all, as you might imagine with broadband 
inside homes comes WiFi, and as WiFi becomes increasingly a distribution mechanism within the home, the 
importance of tying that together with a central location in the home which can be thought of as the set-top box 
location, is something that we think we have a very interesting opportunity to pursue here and do some good 
things with. The other piece is that we do think that long-term, video comes about on terminal devices, on 
handsets, on other new kinds of devices which some might be made by Linksys and some might be made by 
others, but the delivery of video to those devices is again a systems level approach. It's not just about catching a 
stream and showing it on this smaller device or this portable device, but it is about plugging together the pieces 
so the consumer experience can be held together. 
Again, that's where a great deal of Scientific-Atlanta systems level experience can be brought to bear and 
differentiate the combined companies in the marketplace. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Next question, please. 
OPERATOR: Christin Armacost with SG Cowen. 
CHRISTIN ARMACOST, ANALYST, SG COWEN: Two questions. First, can you talk about how you plan to 
integrate the Linksys division with Scientific-Atlanta? I believe Linksys did acquire a set-top box like technology 
called KISS. And then secondly with respect to the U.S. market specifically, there has been a lot of deals already 
announced for the quadruple play from the telcos. So do you think this acquisition today could change any of the 
deals already announced? Thank you. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Jim, I'm going to ask you to answer that second one, but without saying specific names of 
customers, as we both know every one of these in the U.S. It will absolutely be a huge opportunity for us outside 
the U.S. as we capitalize on it. Right time will tell if we can do that or not. In terms of Linksys and 
Scientific-Atlanta and Cisco core routing and switching, we will over time tightly couple the architectures 
together on that. I look at Linksys with the KISS acquisition not as a set-top acquisition at all, but moving 
intelligence into DVDs and moving intelligence throughout the market. But if it goes to the extent that we hope 
that it will, that you will be able to manage, download information, service, etc., electronic devices in the home 
through a Linksys portal.

Page 86 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
So our intent from the time we bought Linksys all the way through was not only to move down market into the 
consumer entertainment and total communications of data, voice, video with mobility, but also to move up market 
to where the service providers could use the Linksys products, uniquely manage them, roll them out to the 
consumer, and what we announced this last week, even to the low-end of small to medium-size business. In 
terms of a little bit of product overlap, that is normal in a marketplace, and I don't think it will be a distraction at all. 
But I see Linksys being separate from Scientific-Atlanta, and both of those separate from our core direction on 
routing and switching to other advanced technologies. 
Jim, maybe your thoughts about customer markets here. And I know we can almost finish each other's sentences 
with the customers here in terms of what opportunities may be, but without getting too specific in a way that might 
get us in trouble with them. 
JIM MCDONALD: Well, on our last conference call I told people that we were in possession of material 
information and we weren't able to buy our stock, and everybody is going to conclude that this was that. Well, 
there's actually more than that. There's other things out there, so our hope is that we are going to want a piece of 
all the major telephone players. So some announced, some not announced. The key for this is that you've got to 
go in and build the relationship with them. You have got to go -- really figure out exactly where they want to go, 
and most of these customers all want something a little bit different. It's all built off of the same core technology, 
but you have to package it a little bit differently. 
So I think what you find is that as you build these relationships, there is an opportunity to do more and more for 
these customers. And if you look at the capital budgets of a couple of guys, they're almost as large as the whole 
cable industry by themselves individually. So it is a huge opportunity to supply these guys, and you never give up 
on them. You've just got to keep going back. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I think Jim and I both enjoy selling, but more importantly we enjoy developing relationships 
which last to make a difference in the market. So I think you'll see this expertise go into the telco market pretty 
effectively. 
JIM MCDONALD: If we add value, they'll do business with us. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Next question please, operator. 
OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question. Cisco Systems and Scientific-Atlanta invite you 
to a business and technical overview of this announcement at 11:00 AM Eastern time today. Telephone 
information and webcast access can be found on both companies' Web pages. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Operator, let me just close on behalf of Jim and I and our employees and our shareholders 
and our customers, we thank you for the time we spent with you today. We really think this offers a very unique 
opportunity in a marketplace and a chance to really, I think, lead in this next market transition on their quadruple 
play, but also really focus initially on the service provider and the consumer. So thank you very much for joining 
us. Jim, it's going to be fun working together. 
JIM MCDONALD: And I would also like to thank you for joining us. I would certainly pass along to all our 
employees that we're certainly proud of all the things we have done and all the things that we're going to be able 
to do together in the future. And we will get around to see all the customers as soon as we can. We know that 
you'll have a lot of questions, but we will get there very quickly and we'll be talking to you today and tomorrow -- 
today and Monday. So thank you for joining us. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Thank you, operator. 
OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 
800-841-4034. For participants dialing from outside the U.S., please dial 203-369-3360. You may disconnect at

OPERATOR: Good morning and welcome to today's Cisco Systems Scientific-Atlanta conference call. 
Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. (OPERATOR 
INSTRUCTIONS). Until then all lines will remain in a listen-only fashion. As a reminder, today's call is being 
recorded at the request of the Company. Should you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I'd 
now like to introduce Ms. Terry Anderson, Director of Corporate Public Relations of Cisco Systems. Ma'am, you 
may begin. 
TERRY ANDERSON, DIRECTOR CORPORATE PR, CISCO SYSTEMS: Good morning, everyone and welcome 
to our conference call announcing Cisco's definitive agreement to acquire Scientific-Atlanta of Lawrenceville, 
Georgia. This is Terry Anderson of Corporate Communications at Cisco Systems and I'm here with John 
Chambers, President and CEO; Mike Volpi, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Routing and Service 
Provider Technology Group; and Ned Hooper, Vice President of Corporate Business Development. Also with us 
is Scientific-Atlanta President and CEO, Jim McDonald, and Tom Robey, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Over the next fifteen minutes, John and Jim will discuss the Scientific-Atlanta acquisition we are announcing 
today. A 20 to 30 minute question and answer period will follow. A press release with information on today's 
announcement can be found on First Call, Full National Business Wire, the European Business and Technical 
Wire and on the Cisco website at www.Cisco.com . A replay of the Cisco Scientific-Atlanta conference call will 
be available from 11 AM Eastern time on November 18, 2005 to 8 PM Eastern time on November 23, 2005 at 
800-841-4034 in the United States and 203-369-3360 internationally. The replay is also available on the Cisco 
Investor Relations website at www.Cisco.com/go/investors . 
The matters both companies will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject 
to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most 
recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that 
could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Unauthorized 
recording of this conference call is not permitted and now I would like to turn the call over to John Chambers. 
JOHN CHAMBERS, PRESIDENT & CEO, CISCO SYSTEMS: Terry, thank you very much and good morning, 
everyone. In today's call, it will be my pleasure to partner with my counterpart from Scientific-Atlanta, Jim 
McDonald. We will cover the following topics. First, Cisco's overall vision and strategy for the service provider 
and consumer market segments as data, voice, video and mobility converge. Second, how Scientific-Atlanta, 
the industry leader in video products and expertise, fits into that strategy and vision. Third, Scientific-Atlanta's 
view on the marketplace evolution and reasons for this combination with Cisco and finally, Jim and I will be 
honored to have a good Q&A with each of you. 
First let me begin by saying that today's announcement represents much more than an exciting opportunity for 
Cisco. It literally completes a large part of our quadruple play as data, voice, video and mobility converge. In 
many industry analysts' perspective, Cisco is in the leadership position for sustainable differentiation in data, 
voice and mobility convergence. Today's announcement is a major move in completing the fourth element, which 
is video leadership. 
Our strategy has clearly been that intelligence will be distributed throughout the network and that the network will 
eventually become the platform of the future. We believe that layers one through seven of the OSI stock will at 
first be loosely and then tightly coupled together with all elements encompassing the convergence of data, voice, 
video and mobility. The future service provider and consumer markets will in our opinion require intelligence, 
application, storage, processors and services resin (ph) throughout the network. We believe that today's 
acquisition extends our commitment and leadership in both the service provider and consumer market segments. 
As we said in Q1 earnings call just last week, the service provider market segment is approximately 25% of our 
total product business while the consumer market segment is approximately 4%. Both are key drivers for future 
growth opportunities. The market opportunities represented by this announcement will become the eighth

Page 89 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
advanced technology in the area that we will call for today digital video. As a reminder, our current seven 
advanced technologies include home networking, enterprise IP communications, optical networking, security, 
storage area networking, wireless and, as we announced this past Monday, our host of small-business systems 
or linked as one direction. 
Video is emerging as a key element in the service provider quadruple play bundle encompassing consumer 
entertainment, communications and online services. In fact, video may be the most critical element in this bundle 
for ensuring consumer differentiation and loyalty or stickiness if you will to service providers. The opportunity for 
Cisco is to dramatically reduce the complexity of converging data, voice, video over IP in both a fixed and mobile 
environment, which is at the core of our expertise. 
As we have been saying for several years, an integrated architecture is, in our opinion, the only way to reduce 
this complexity. Our experience in this market has shown that the more you provide an end-to-end solution to 
service providers and to the consumer, the greater your likelihood of gaining a larger share of the capital 
expenditures. For example, this integrated end-to-end approach allows service providers to rapidly and cost 
effectively deploy new services. 
From a consumer market perspective, we believe that it is the consumer view that is driving the next wave of 
application in the home and therefore the infrastructure of the future must evolve to enable consumers to 
personalize their experiences with data, voice, video and mobility. Cisco has a broad reach in three of these key 
areas that make up the quadruple play for service providers; data, voice and mobility. And Scientific, in our 
opinion, is the leader in the fourth area, video. 
They have touched directly approximately 50 million consumers. With this acquisition, Cisco offers an end-to-end 
quadruple play in the service provider market segment and expands the quad play in the consumer market. In our 
opinion, Scientific-Atlanta brings the broadest reaching combination of video expertise in the market ranging 
from the set-top boxes to transmission networks and the professional services to both deliver and remake video 
work uniquely for the fourth solution. 
As we've said many times, we believe the industry in which Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta participate will 
consolidate. And that innovation will continue to be through internal development, acquisitions and partnerships. 
For companies to lead both from an innovation and a marketshare perspective, they must be able to do all three 
in our opinion. 
Video entertainment is becoming increasingly digital and on demand with rapid global adoption of high-definition 
TV and digital video recording driving the migration to IP-centric platforms. Cable operators are entering the 
network and set-top box upgrade cycle and telcos are building out new infrastructure for delivery of video 
entertainment. 
Scientific-Atlanta totals approximately 6% of Cisco's current market capitalization but it immediately positions 
Cisco as an end-to-end leader in a key strategic area of video delivery for the service provider market segment, 
which industry analysts believe to be approximately a 10 billion market opportunity by 2009. In combination with 
our strong consumer market position through Linksys, we will now have a more complete portfolio for the digital 
home. In particular, our ability to create a unified home network for Scientific-Atlanta set-top boxes and Linksys 
network entertainment products provides Cisco with a unique differentiation in the consumer market segment. 
I would like to now offer more details surrounding the deal. The purchase price for Scientific-Atlanta was 
approximately $6.9 billion or $43 per outstanding share in cash. After removing the net cash on 
Scientific-Atlanta's balance sheet, the net purchase price is 5.3 billion. It is premature to discuss the financial 
impact after the close but we expect the acquisition to be neutral to Cisco's pro forma earnings in FY '06 to be 
slightly accretive to pro forma earnings in FY '07 and financed with a combination of cash and debt. 
Scientific-Atlanta's current estimated growth rate according to industry analysts is 10 to 12%. After the 
combination and including synergies brought by Cisco, there is the potential with the appropriate caveat as 
outlined in our forward-looking statements to grow between 12 and 16% compounded annual growth rate from FY 
'07 to FY '10 for the area of video that Scientific-Atlanta is focused on. 
The acquisition has been approved by the Board of Directors of each company and is subject to various closing 
conditions. When this acquisition closes, we will cover in more detail the financial model and expected financial 
impact. We expect the acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta to close during Cisco's Q3 FY '06 but is subject to 
regulatory approval. Upon the close, Scientific-Atlanta will join Cisco's routing and service provider technology 
group under the leadership of Senior Vice President, Mike Volpi, supporting Cisco's efforts in the service provider 
market segment.

I have always believed that the driver of your vision and strategy should be your customers, and as such, solicit 
(ph) tests for all major strategies or acquisition decisions are those same customers. Yesterday evening I shared 
with the appropriate confidentiality commitment today's announcements with two major U.S. service providers and 
one European service provider. The reactions were very similar and could be summarized in the following way. 
First, they were very direct in saying this combination makes tremendous sense and brings a unique excitement 
to the industry. And in various ways each of them articulated how this combination represents the potential to 
uniquely position Cisco from an architectural perspective for both service providers and the consumer. 
And now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim McDonald, President and CEO of Scientific-Atlanta. Jim, 
welcome to the Cisco team. 
JIM MCDONALD, PRESIDENT & CEO, SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA: Thank you, John. Good morning and I'd also like 
to thank you for joining us this morning. Today's announcement of our agreement to be acquired by Cisco 
Systems is a landmark event in the history of Scientific-Atlanta. The combined strengths and resources of our 
two companies will position us to address more quickly the growing number of opportunities in the markets we 
serve. More rapid time to market and a broader base of new products and systems will benefit all of our 
stakeholders with particular emphasis on customers, employees and our shareholders. I want to briefly share with 
you the process by which we came to this decision and our strong belief that this transaction is the right course 
for both Scientific-Atlanta and Cisco. 
The markets we serve have been changing rapidly and we believe the rate of change will accelerate. We expect a 
variety of interrelated changes. Technology advances will make new products available. Our customers' markets 
will consolidate and bundling of many services, including video, will become increasingly important to all of our 
customers. Over the past twelve years, we have seen tremendous amount of consolidation among cable 
operators. Today, two top cable operators serve more than 30 million subscribers. During this consolidation, 
technology has changed rapidly allowing our customers to offer new services. 
Our cable customers are now moving to new network architectures to allow the delivery of video, high-speed data 
and voice services over a converged network. At the same time, telephone companies are entering the 
entertainment market by offering a bundle of video, data and voice services. These customers want more 
complete, integrated solutions from fewer vendors. 
This rapid change in technology can be seen in our newest products. We offer hard drives and modems and 
set-tops and cable modems now can support both data and voice services. Soon we will have DVD burners 
available in our digital video recorders. This dynamic environment generates a tremendous amount of potential 
for us. However, we need a greater scope in resources to capture the opportunities in the expanding markets. 
As a result, we have evaluated a variety of opportunities to identify a combination that would provide the most 
value to our shareholders, would enable us to provide a broader set of products to meet customers expanding 
needs and would leverage complementary technologies and at the same time would have compatible corporate 
cultures. The clear answer to us is Cisco Systems. Both Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta have achieved 
tremendous technical leadership in strong positions in their respective markets. 
The combined skills and experience of Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta's positions position us uniquely to provide 
the products and systems, not only for today's architectures, but also for the next generation architectures that our 
customers are planning and beginning to implement. The worldwide markets served by our companies are 
growing in large. Together, we can offer complete solutions to our customers for their integrated intelligent 
networks and customer premise equipment, including home networking. Our customers will be able to enhance 
their competitive position by taking advantage of our cost-effective, end-to-end solutions. 
Our company cultures are compatible. Both companies lead with technology and have strong 
engineering-oriented environments. Both companies recognize that their long-term success is related to the ability 
to serve their customers very well. And both companies are committed to the health and welfare of their 
employees and the quality of life in the communities in which they operate. We believe that this transaction is 
beneficial to our shareholders. Cisco's offer of $43 per share or approximately $6.9 billion represents a 28% 
premium over the closing price on October 27th before rumors of the sale began to appear in a number of 
publications. 
On an enterprise basis, which adjusts for cash and short-term investments net of debt on our balance sheet, the 
premium compared to closing price on October 27th is approximately 40%. Let me explain the calculation to you. 
In calculating the premium, we began with the stock price on October 27th. The closing price of our stock on that

Page 91 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
day was $33.62 reflecting the sum of two components. First, the operation of the Company, which generates 
financial results on an ongoing basis and second, our cash and short-term investments net of debt. 
Since our cash and short-term investments net of debt represents approximately $10 per share, the operations of 
the Company were valued at approximately $23.62 per share. This was the enterprise value on October 27th. 
Similarly, the Cisco offer of $43 per share values the operation of our Company at approximately $33. The 
difference between the two amounts represents our approximate $10 of cash and short-term investments. The 
enterprise value premium of this transaction is the difference in value between the enterprise value of the offer 
and the enterprise value on October 27th. This difference of $9.38 represents a premium of approximately 40%. 
In the process, we solicit fairness opinions from three outside parties; Credit Suisse First Boston, Evercore, both 
of which advised us on this transaction and Lehman Brothers, which was not otherwise involved in the sale. As 
you might expect, there are a lot of decisions yet to be made and many details that the management teams must 
work out. One thing however is clear. Cisco is committed to enabling Scientific-Atlanta to continue to execute its 
business plan. I will remain with the Company for two years and all of our senior management team have agreed 
to stay on following the close of the transaction. 
Our customers and employees should have no doubt of Cisco's commitment that we will not compromise the 
service and innovation that contributes to our customers' success and provide a dynamic and rewarding 
workplace for our employees. 
In summary, we are taking an extraordinary successful company and enhancing its prospects for continued 
success by joining with Cisco Systems. We believe that the combination will better able us to serve our existing 
customers, it will better position us to expand our served markets and it will provide a virtually unique set of 
technical capabilities through which it can address the customers needs. We believe that the world is full of 
potential and, as part of Cisco, we will look forward to capturing those new opportunities. Now we would be 
pleased to take any questions. 
OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Nikos Theodosopoulos, UBS. 
NIKOS THEODOSOPOULOS, ANALYST, UBS: Well, first of all, let me just say congratulations on what seems to 
be a fair price for both parties and congratulations to Cisco for buying the company with a long history of earnings 
growth in cash flow generation. My question is on the integration, specifically manufacturing and management. 
Scientific-Atlanta does predominantly all its manufacturing. It has a plant in Mexico. Cisco has an outsource 
model. Can you talk about whether you plan on changing that in the near or long-term. Then on management, I 
think I heard Jim say he is going to stay on for a couple of years. I know if I look back at when Motorola bought 
General Instrument, there was a lot of momentum lost in that company in the transition of that in that acquisition. 
Can you talk about how you're going to try to do a good job on the integration between the two companies? 
Thank you. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Sure. First is I think you started off with exactly the right premise. You have got two 
companies here that see the market evolution almost identical. And they complement each other in very unique 
ways, which we will consolidate as the market consolidates. In terms of the teams, as Jim said, all of the senior 
management has signed up to staying with the combination and secondly, we will make no changes in the 
organization structure for at least one to two years, and may not even at that time. 
In terms of specific manufacturing, our Head of Manufacturing, Angel Mendez and Hector from your all's side are 
down in the manufacturing plant in Mexico at the present time. They are world-class in manufacturing. Our team 
came back and said this was the best manufacturing organization they have seen in Mexico. And a lot of what 
Jim's team does is not individual standalone products. They are very tightly integrated together from their ASICs 
development, to their systems, to their manufacturing, to their consultancy, to their set-top boxes and they have it 
fueled uniquely to make it work. So Nikos, for us to break that part, especially at the beginning, would not make 
any sense at all. 
Secondly, as we have said many times before, we have done world-class acquisitions and 40% plus of our 
management team are from those acquisitions. So Jim has a very broad group of leaders that we've heard an 
awful lot about and we met with this morning and I would expect them not only to stay here at the 
Scientific-Atlanta division within Cisco but for many of them to have, if they're willing to do it, responsibilities well 
beyond this in other segments of Cisco as we move forward. 
I think -- I'm going to ask Jim to comment a little bit on the momentum. I think both of us would anticipate from the 
rumors in the market and questions going on you might lose a little bit of momentum right at the start but we've 
actually seen the reverse from our customers. The few customers that we confidentially bounced this off of last

Page 92 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
night were almost the reserve. I think our biggest challenge, Jim, as we discussed with the leaders today, is to 
prioritize the opportunities. 
We think that you, if we do it right, will see the reserve instead of Jim growing at the 10 to 12% (indiscernible), 
with the appropriate caveats, we think in terms of this opportunity both in the U.S. but also opening up a large 
segment of the international field could potentially change that growth rate from 10 to 12 to 12 to 16 more in the 
traditional rate that we have both seen. Jim, your thoughts? 
JIM MCDONALD: I think first relative to the manufacturing thing. We're quite proud of what the people have built 
in Juarez and when I came 12 years ago we had ours outsourced in Japan and we were losing all the value we 
were regenerating through the currency transactions. And we had a large part of our business that goes into 
North America and you can imagine the number of trucks and semis that have to pull out when you ship 1.1 
million, 1.2 million set-tops each quarter. So a lot of the manufacturing strategy has got to be based on where 
your customers are, what you have to get to them. We have a lot of it sourced outside in terms of components 
and parts and most of that is really sourced in the Far East. So manufacturing strategies need to be flexible. 
I think on the other point is we have obviously had some distractions with all the publications and things that have 
surrounded this over the last couple of weeks. I am sure, as our organizations go forward, there will be some 
distractions. But if you look at the long-term combination, we have a tremendous potential here to grow the 
business. 
OPERATOR: Steve Kamman, CIBC. 
STEVE KAMMAN, ANALYST, CIBC: I have got two questions. Number one is strategically, as you know, the 
whole set-top box market is undergoing some pretty significant transition probably I think enabled by Cisco trying 
to can opener some of the more proprietary elements of that model. So I guess the question is how are you going 
to manage that transition if you get to more of an open set-top model and that leads into kind of the next element 
of my question, which is while I do agree SFA is a phenomenally well-managed company, you're looking at gross 
margins in the 37, 40% range, operating margins in the 20% range, 17 to 20% range. You guys are obviously 
significantly higher than that. Do you think you can bring SFA up to more of a Cisco like margin model or is this 
going to pull down the margins out of Cisco? I realize it's early in the transaction but this is something you had to 
have thought about. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Okay, Steve. Break it into pieces. We, both Jim and I, do not see the market as evolved as 
individual boxes. We basically see a market where, using the OSI stock as an example, layers one through seven 
come together. Intelligent, at first throughout the network, and then over time the network becoming the platform. 
And I think this really is one more step along that way. 
In terms of the set-top box market, you watch what is there. It's an ASICs product. It's a combination and the 
uniqueness that Scientific-Atlanta brings and this is an art to make video really work well. That was one of the 
lessons that we have learned by talking with service providers and cable companies around the world. It is an art 
to make this work. were. They bring the combination of that to the market. So what customers will pay a premium 
for and there will obviously be different margin models just like there is in our Linksys market where we have 
much lower gross margins and much lower operating expenses. We will go after markets in terms of what is the 
bottom line profit potential and as you begin to provide an end-to-end solution with industry-leading innovation 
and products that integrate together and it would therefore reduce the risk for our customers and increase their 
time to market to get their revenues. For the consumer, less complexity. That actually will increase your margin 
potential in total. 
Do I expect Scientific-Atlanta's margins to come all the way up to Cisco? No, of course not. But do I think, just 
like the Linksys model, you're going to begin to make integration together and I think in total, we will improve our 
joint margins more than we would without the combination to occur. 
JIM MCDONALD: I think the other thing to think about is that what you are really trying to do is drive new services 
to the consumer. And if you think of where storage is for example we do VOD and SVOD and we have new things 
our customers are doing, which allows you to restart a program when you come in 20 minutes late, you can 
restart it. At the same time, you have storage in the device. So you have DVRs and you have a lot of function 
there. So I think what you find is all parts of the model drive each other and some parts of the model have one 
profitability analysis and other parts have a different. I think what you really are going to do is they are going to be 
complementary and drive each other and some pieces will be lower but a lot of other pieces you will drive back in 
the network are much higher profit models. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I agree, Jim.

OPERATOR: Talli Anni, Merrill Lynch. 
TALLI ANNI, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: My question is Scientific-Atlanta is a great company, great 
execution history but it is a change from the strategy you've said in the past. John, you have said in the past that 
you're going to be looking mostly at acquisitions that are close to the headquarter, small growth companies and 
here you're buying a company that is far from the headquarter. Growth is 10 to 12% rather than the higher growth 
rate you have in your advanced technologies. It is against what you've said in the past. So what led you to take 
this decision to buy a larger company rather than a smaller company? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Well, you are right that our market has traditionally been a combination of 104 companies. 
We've actually had several companies that were in this price range in the 5 to $7 billion that we have done and at 
least one that represented about 20% of our headcount at that point in time. If you look at our focus, we have a 
very firm rule. When you move into markets, you either partner, acquire or develop in the first five to market. Once 
those first five are established by definition, you either partner with them or acquire. 
Video is an integral part of our strategy that must be part of Cisco's competency. And so when, you are right, if 
you look at our five rules of thumb in terms of acquisitions, one of them, geographic proximity, is not matched. But 
the other four actually match very well. It is extremely strategically aligned with how we see the market evolving 
and our vision of that market and the role that we play as data, voice, video converges. So you don't do an 
acquisition, especially of this size, unless it matches very tightly versus the strategy and vision and a sustainable 
differentiation with it. 
Secondly is you create short-term wins for the shareholders, the customers, the employees, essentially the 
employees of the acquired company. We think we have done that very successfully and our chemistry match with 
your people, Jim, is really amazing. We have got a lot of talent here that I'm finding with a group of people that 
understand how I speak with a southern accent. And you are going to find that we will do very well in not just 
retaining the employees but both of our companies have a track record of doing that very effectively. 
Third is the long-term strategic initiative. It opens up to the market in a way that is going to be very difficult for 
competitors to match in terms of how we think this market will evolve and we think these devices will all do data, 
voice, video and mobility integration. And when you bounce this off of our potential customers, there is not a one 
that didn't say this was just an amazing, amazing move and they understand why these two companies will 
uniquely come together. 
The next element that we do look at is similar cultures. It's amazing, when Jim and talked, and it's the same thing 
among our teams, we can almost finish each other sentences about individual customers. What's important to 
them, what's their approach, how do we view them, what do they expect from us, etc.? So our cultures are 
remarkably similar. You do have a geographic proximity issue here. If Jim were in Silicon Valley, it would be five 
out of five. But four out of five isn't bad and I go back to the most basic issue of all probably, which is the first five 
to market are always the leaders long-term. Scientific-Atlanta is number one in our opinion by a very long way, 
not just in products but integration. So that's why we focused on it and I think this will be a very successful 
acquisition. 
If you watch the three or four that have made a difference in our future, the first one, Crescendo, an acquisition, 
which for $10 million of revenue turned out to be billions of dollars in terms of revenue per year now. StrataCom, 
which clearly brought us into the market and it was the largest acquisition we have done at that point in time over 
$5 billion and a lot of headcount. Then the Linksys acquisition, which a year and a half ago led us into the 
consumer market, and now I think the Scientific-Atlanta one that leads us into the video integration. 
So while we have done a lot of acquisitions, I'd really put Scientific-Atlanta in potentially the top four if we both 
execute well. Jim, I don't if you would add to that? 
JIM MCDONALD: I think if you'd look at our customer base, especially all the large customers, I think you would 
find that all of our large customers are very large customers of Cisco. So it starts with we have an enormous 
amount of synergy coming from the customer. So if you start there and you start to move back, I think that we 
deal with very similar technologies. We have similar makeups in how our organizations are structured in terms of 
talent. So I think as you look through the things, there is just a whole lot of things that are very common starting 
all the way with the customer. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I would agree. Next question please. 
OPERATOR: Tim Long, Banc of America.

Page 94 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
TIM LONG, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA: Two quick ones if I could. First, John, for you, maybe could you just 
talk a little bit about Cisco's position in cable, fairly diversified. So could you discuss a little bit if this maybe 
causes a disruption in some of your other cable business maybe in some networks that are more driven by 
Motorola. So do you see an impact to the rest of the cable business? And then for Jim, I'd love to get some 
customer thoughts out of you, even if not from discussions in the last 24 hours. I'm sure you've had these 
discussions over the last few years and particularly would love to know if there have been certain examples, 
whether in the U.S. or internationally, where large deals maybe that didn't go your way could have more clearly 
gone your way if you had a more diverse product offering, including what you're going to have to offer now with 
Cisco. Thanks. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: First, Tim, in terms of the cable business, it has been a tremendously successful segment 
for Cisco, not just in terms of revenue. It grew over 30% this last year and as we said in prior conference calls, 
crossed the $1 billion market for Cisco and while Mike is here, I feel very comfortable in speaking for him on this 
one that I clearly expect with the appropriate caveat that they would grow again in excess of 30%. But if you 
watch what this does, this makes end cable an end-to-end solution and this is very similar to what we have done 
in enterprise. So when you think about an enterprise, what we've been very successful on was an architectural 
play where we filled in all the pieces. 
In cable, we have done the exact same thing. You are now in a position where together we are the key leader 
with a very large marketshare and the traditional routing. We are the clear leader in IP telephony. We are the 
leader in mobility and when you look at the cable combinations with companies like Sprint Nextel, you begin to 
realize the leverage from the mobility side of the house. 
Once you add video to that, not just from a product perspective but an integration and tying this all together, 
which Jim's team is amazing at making work, that gives us I think leadership that is very, very unique and I think 
you'll find the cable players, Tim, probably without exception will say this was a tremendous move for them. I 
would expect you would see them move very rapidly in terms of what we can do together. 
I would add just one other issue before I turn it over to Jim, which is we think we can bring a lot together in the 
international community, which has not been a major focus of Scientific-Atlanta up to this time. So whether it is 
in cable or the traditional BTTs, we think that's a large opportunity for us as well. Jim, to you. 
JIM MCDONALD: If you think of the two parts you asked. The first one is I called my largest two customers last 
night because we have confidential relationships with them and we have been friends for a long time and they 
were both very positive on the transaction. They are also very large customers of Cisco today. So they know 
Cisco. They know us very well. So I think if you look at the customer side of this thing, they are quite positive 
because they are interested in speed to market, how they get new services in front of the consumer, how they put 
all of this stuff and integrate it together. As you do this, these things get more complicated and you need more 
depth of resources and you need a lot of different kinds of resources to do it. So they were quite positive. 
Have I lost a deal I should have gotten? Sure. I've lost one and I know specifically why I lost it was because I 
didn't have the ongoing relationship with the customer because as the telephone guys enter the market, we don't 
have that long historical relationship with those guys. Even though we were selected as having the best products, 
we lost the deal because we didn't have the relationship. Having said that, having given up on it, we are about to 
get back in. But especially if you look at the international markets, we don't have the relationships to carry the 
switch digital video internationally. We don't have the telephone relationships. This is clearly an area where we 
can get a lot of acceleration because Cisco has these relationships and we have things we can sell them. We just 
don't have the relationships with the customers. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: It's interesting. One last comment on the cable. Jim touched base with his two largest. I 
touched base with my largest and my largest said, John, this makes tremendous sense for you all together and 
we view you in a different way than we even did before even though you were very strategic before. Thank you, 
Tim. 
OPERATOR: Brantly Thompson, Goldman Sachs. 
BRANTLEY THOMPSON, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: John, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit 
about the growth rate. You had put into two buckets; SFA at 10 to 12% and then potentially 12 to 16%. You 
commented that the non U.S. is part of that opportunity. But could you talk about what things you will be putting in 
place to try to expand that growth rate and when we might see some milestones around that? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Sure. Breaking it into the segments. First of all, we believe that our own market, prior to this 
combination, was going to grow in the 10 to 15% range and we have been very open in our views on that. The

Page 95 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
second part in terms of the approach, if you begin to think about the synergies that you now bring to the telco 
market and to the cable marketplace, those could be pretty substantial for our joint customers today. 
The elements outside the U.S., and remember, Mike, what is it? The majority of our service provider business is 
outside the U.S., 60% and it is growing at a faster rate than inside the U.S. in most of the quarters. Especially in 
the Asia-Pacific and our emerging geographies. So that clearly would be key element. IP/TV will take off. So while 
we are very united in architectural approach in the cable marketplace and they will be really the first service 
providers where we will be providing end-to-end architectures, we are beginning to see the telcos really focused 
on IP/TV and Jim's team has been able to do that in a very unique way in talking to the customers, not mentioning 
the combination when they talked about Scientific-Atlanta. They said this company really gets this and they 
have both the products. But more importantly an integration capability to tie it together. Thank you very much. 
OPERATOR: Alex Henderson, Citigroup. 
ALEX HENDERSON, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the advanced 
technology decision to categorize this as one. It seems a little bit different from what most people would have 
thought was the approach. It almost seems like you're taking existing businesses and slicing them in and calling 
them advanced technologies platforms now. Should we be changing the way we're thinking about that a little bit? 
You are starting with an acquisition here that is fairly sizable, which obviously puts you much further down the 
curve. How should we think about further acquisitions that might launch advanced technologies platforms? 
Should we be viewing this as one of a number of steps to fill out that platform? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I think that would be the right way to do it. I think if you think about advanced technologies, 
you want to think about it as technology market segments that have a potential to be $1 billion business for Cisco 
that we think we can maintain if we execute right a sustainable differentiation that our target is 40% plus 
marketshare as we move into those, and that it fits in and could be integrated with our other advanced 
technologies in our core routing and switching. Scientific-Atlanta clearly hits all those elements. 
We will use emerging technologies and we've announced two of them already this year as if you think about it 
internal development, in terms of opportunities that may develop in advanced technologies. And when they 
become advanced, we then will focus the resources of the whole company on them. But our movement the other 
day with the Linksys One approach and our movement today, we will announce one more yet this year probably 
at the analysts meeting in terms of a ninth advanced technology; really speaks to movement into new markets 
that we believe will integrate tightly over time into our strategy. If we do our job right, you will see us just continue 
to generate those. I don't expect them all to be successful, although I know this one will. But we will take some of 
the risk in other advanced technologies as we move forward. 
ALEX HENDERSON: If I might follow on with that. Historically, you talk about integration risk as a major concern 
about doing larger acquisitions. If you've got this fairly sizable acquisition to integrate, should we anticipate that 
that would diminish the probability of a similar approach in the near-term at least? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Let me answer that question indirectly. I don't have -- I don't normally do what I call 
medium-sized acquisitions. We have done two or three of them in the past. We may do some of them in the 
future. We don't believe in real large acquisitions. 5000 of Jim's people are in the manufacturing arena, about 
2000 are in the professional service engineering arena, etc. So for 2000 engineers, I don't view this as a large 
acquisition in the sense that is going to take a huge amount of time to get the groups working effectively. 
The fact that we're keeping it as an independent division reporting to Mike and the service provider strategy 
speaks to the importance of not losing momentum as we move forward in this arena. But I think, just like our 
sampling of acquisitions that we have done over the last 12 years has been in a range that this one very much fits 
into, the majority of them will continue to be small acquisitions, privately held, 100 engineers being ideal. But, 
Alex, what we will never violate is once a market starts to go, we see the market transition occurring, if we are not 
in the first five there on our own internal development, we will either partner or acquire one of the first five. This 
video is way to important to me and to Jim to do this in a partnership type of arrangement. So I think you'll find 
that they will fit in very, very tightly in terms of the direction. 
JIM MCDONALD: I think one of the things you will see as a trend is customers are going to continue to reduce the 
number of vendors that they have and the reason is that the integration of these things is the critical element and 
the more vendors you bring to the table, the more difficult the integration problem is. So I think anyone that can 
come to market with a complete set of solutions is going to make this an awful lot easier for the customers. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: It's basically as those products are at first loosely coupled together and then tightly coupled 
together. So this is right down the sweet spot. It's what we said we were going to do for a decade; data, voice,

Page 96 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
video converging with mobility. We think time will tell if we're right but we think it is a huge move both in the 
service provider and in the consumer marketplace. But looking out two to four years, I think we will also expand it 
in our enterprise direction. Next question please. 
OPERATOR: Bill Becklean, Oppenheimer. 
BILL BECKLEAN, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER: I'd like to pursue the whole notion of increasing 
Scientific-Atlanta's growth rate from 10 to 12 to 12 to 16 and that is -- it strikes me as the entire market for 
Scientific-Atlanta's products isn't growing 12 to 16. So what you're talking about is trying to drive an entire 
market, not just take share, to get Scientific-Atlanta's growth rate up and that follows into my more important 
question and that is when I'm looking at your advanced technology initiatives, most of those have had very high 
growth rates associated with them. Are you telling us here that there are no billion dollar opportunities out there 
that are going to be growing north of 15% that can drive your top-line growth in the future? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: It's the reverse of that, Bill and thank you for the question that I know may be on people's 
mind. First the advanced technology that we announced, the Linksys One, is a super high-growth marketplace 
and they will start small but the growth rates from those companies, as we have seen in other areas, if they are 
successful is, in the early phases, in the 50 to 100 maybe even 200% type of ranges year-over-year. As you 
begin to look at driving an entire market, I'd just like to qualify that by saying think about Scientific-Atlanta, 75% 
of your business here in the U.S., 25% outside the U.S. So you have the majority of the world for their products at 
the present time had not gotten the penetration and we had the relationships in these key service providers from 
the BTs, to the DTs, to the Telefonicas, to Telecom Italias, the emerging markets, the Telstras, the areas in India, 
etc. So we actually see this as a major opportunity to gain a larger share of that $10 billion market looking out let's 
say by 2009, 2010 from the 2 billion that Scientific-Atlanta has. 
The synergies will also tie, that if we do our job right, we will sell more of our product and the combination will 
allow us to get higher gross margins and also improve dramatically the services and profitability our partners 
have. So I think you'll see us do both. You'll see us enter certain markets that are very strategic to us that are 
growing in more our traditional growth rates and we think we can accelerate those by a combination. You'll 
continue to see us enter a number of markets that are new and have rapid growth but will probably be material 
looking out two to five years and then you will see us continue to drive our current advanced technologies, which 
I'm very pleased with. They grew about 25% quarter-over-quarter this last quarter. So it will be a combination of 
all the above and Bill, thank you for the clarification question. 
OPERATOR: Mark Sue, RBC Capital Markets. 
MARK SUE, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Can you just give us some further specifics on execution and 
management, on senior management commitments? How do you prevent Scientific-Atlanta from becoming 
another Sailent (ph)? And separately, if I look at end-to-end video, it still seems we're missing some elements for 
IP/TV. How much more do you need to spend on video and how much do you need to spend on mobility? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I'm going to divide the question between Jim and I. One of the things that Jim does 
extremely well is this culture here is one of very much an employee family. Their loyalty and their turnover is 
actually even better than Cisco which we run, as you all know, 4% voluntary. We also have done a remarkable 
job. Some of the acquisitions, we've held all managers for nearly a decade. Some of the others we've had a little 
bit more turnover. But if you watch our turnover of our acquired companies, in total they only run about 4%. So 
the first thing you look at in terms of the Company as to the strategicness to you is can you hold the key leaders 
and can you hold the key engineers and salespeople, etc. 
Jim and I are very comfortable with our ability to do that, and actually the team has signed up to very fair 
contracts both ways. So it really is based upon trust but also willing to put the financial commitments behind their 
commitment along that line. Jim, you know your team here, and I am very comfortable about their commitment, 
but maybe if you could expand on that. 
JIM MCDONALD: Well, I think if you not only think of the top management but if you think of the whole company, 
generally this is a company where people come to work and they stay here. We don't have much turnover. I'm on 
my 13th year here, and when I go to the staff meeting, I'm the youngest one in the history of the company in 
terms of employment. So all of the people that basically work for me have been here before I got here. And if we 
look at all of our people across the organization, they have a tremendous loyalty not only to the company but to 
the customers we work with and to each other. So it wasn't very difficult to get the people to say, look, we want to 
stay part of this.

Page 97 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
I think the other part is we share a common vision of where this is going. And it is a lot easier when you've got 
people all linked in to where they're going and they have a common view of this to keep them going in that 
direction. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: The interesting thing, Mark, as we work through this transaction, you learn more about 
people under stress from both sides than any other time before. While I kidded earlier about having people to talk 
like I do in terms of the southern accent, it was the ability of both of our teams at all levels to work through issues 
with an unusual candidness, but yet a trust and building. And the relationships got stronger and stronger 
throughout this as opposed to what normally occurs in terms of getting frayed the reverse way. 
Mike, just maybe very quickly on IP/TV and mobility, the thoughts? 
MIKE VOLPI, SVP & GENERAL MANAGER, CISCO SYSTEMS: Sure. A couple of quick comments that I would 
make on both IP/TV and your question about mobility. First, you have to realize as was clear in John and Jim's 
comments earlier that a part of the video market is, of course, an existing market, which is where the cable 
operators plan. But part of the video market is clearly a brand-new market segment that comes about by the 
delivery of video over DSL infrastructure or fiber infrastructure, high-speed, telco, broadband infrastructure. This 
is a massive market segment, and as is clear, the video expertise which is brought to the table by the 
Scientific-Atlanta team is quite unique. Video is a systems solution, meaning that you really can't put it together 
in a way in which customers and consumers are accustomed to without interlinking the key components together 
in a systematic approach. And that knowledge base is extremely critical for a lot of the newer customers such as 
the telcos that don't really have a deep amount of experience to that area today. So we think that this IP/TV is a 
huge opportunity for the combined companies, both domestically as well as internationally, where Cisco has a 
great deal of coverage. 
In terms of the question about mobility, and mobility is a huge field and has a lot of opportunity, I would cite a 
couple of areas where I think there is some relevance here. First of all, as you might imagine with broadband 
inside homes comes WiFi, and as WiFi becomes increasingly a distribution mechanism within the home, the 
importance of tying that together with a central location in the home which can be thought of as the set-top box 
location, is something that we think we have a very interesting opportunity to pursue here and do some good 
things with. The other piece is that we do think that long-term, video comes about on terminal devices, on 
handsets, on other new kinds of devices which some might be made by Linksys and some might be made by 
others, but the delivery of video to those devices is again a systems level approach. It's not just about catching a 
stream and showing it on this smaller device or this portable device, but it is about plugging together the pieces 
so the consumer experience can be held together. 
Again, that's where a great deal of Scientific-Atlanta systems level experience can be brought to bear and 
differentiate the combined companies in the marketplace. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Next question, please. 
OPERATOR: Christin Armacost with SG Cowen. 
CHRISTIN ARMACOST, ANALYST, SG COWEN: Two questions. First, can you talk about how you plan to 
integrate the Linksys division with Scientific-Atlanta? I believe Linksys did acquire a set-top box like technology 
called KISS. And then secondly with respect to the U.S. market specifically, there has been a lot of deals already 
announced for the quadruple play from the telcos. So do you think this acquisition today could change any of the 
deals already announced? Thank you. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Jim, I'm going to ask you to answer that second one, but without saying specific names of 
customers, as we both know every one of these in the U.S. It will absolutely be a huge opportunity for us outside 
the U.S. as we capitalize on it. Right time will tell if we can do that or not. In terms of Linksys and 
Scientific-Atlanta and Cisco core routing and switching, we will over time tightly couple the architectures 
together on that. I look at Linksys with the KISS acquisition not as a set-top acquisition at all, but moving 
intelligence into DVDs and moving intelligence throughout the market. But if it goes to the extent that we hope 
that it will, that you will be able to manage, download information, service, etc., electronic devices in the home 
through a Linksys portal. 
So our intent from the time we bought Linksys all the way through was not only to move down market into the 
consumer entertainment and total communications of data, voice, video with mobility, but also to move up market 
to where the service providers could use the Linksys products, uniquely manage them, roll them out to the 
consumer, and what we announced this last week, even to the low-end of small to medium-size business. In 
terms of a little bit of product overlap, that is normal in a marketplace, and I don't think it will be a distraction at all.

Page 98 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
But I see Linksys being separate from Scientific-Atlanta, and both of those separate from our core direction on 
routing and switching to other advanced technologies. 
Jim, maybe your thoughts about customer markets here. And I know we can almost finish each other's sentences 
with the customers here in terms of what opportunities may be, but without getting too specific in a way that might 
get us in trouble with them. 
JIM MCDONALD: Well, on our last conference call I told people that we were in possession of material 
information and we weren't able to buy our stock, and everybody is going to conclude that this was that. Well, 
there's actually more than that. There's other things out there, so our hope is that we are going to want a piece of 
all the major telephone players. So some announced, some not announced. The key for this is that you've got to 
go in and build the relationship with them. You have got to go -- really figure out exactly where they want to go, 
and most of these customers all want something a little bit different. It's all built off of the same core technology, 
but you have to package it a little bit differently. 
So I think what you find is that as you build these relationships, there is an opportunity to do more and more for 
these customers. And if you look at the capital budgets of a couple of guys, they're almost as large as the whole 
cable industry by themselves individually. So it is a huge opportunity to supply these guys, and you never give up 
on them. You've just got to keep going back. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I think Jim and I both enjoy selling, but more importantly we enjoy developing relationships 
which last to make a difference in the market. So I think you'll see this expertise go into the telco market pretty 
effectively. 
JIM MCDONALD: If we add value, they'll do business with us. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Next question please, operator. 
OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question. Cisco Systems and Scientific-Atlanta invite you 
to a business and technical overview of this announcement at 11:00 AM Eastern time today. Telephone 
information and webcast access can be found on both companies' Web pages. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Operator, let me just close on behalf of Jim and I and our employees and our shareholders 
and our customers, we thank you for the time we spent with you today. We really think this offers a very unique 
opportunity in a marketplace and a chance to really, I think, lead in this next market transition on their quadruple 
play, but also really focus initially on the service provider and the consumer. So thank you very much for joining 
us. Jim, it's going to be fun working together. 
JIM MCDONALD: And I would also like to thank you for joining us. I would certainly pass along to all our 
employees that we're certainly proud of all the things we have done and all the things that we're going to be able 
to do together in the future. And we will get around to see all the customers as soon as we can. We know that 
you'll have a lot of questions, but we will get there very quickly and we'll be talking to you today and tomorrow -- 
today and Monday. So thank you for joining us. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Thank you, operator.

Cisco Systems, the massive vendor of IP routing, switching and transmission gear, acquired Scientific-Atlanta 
today for $6.9 billion in cash, a move that gives Cisco an immediate presence in the video delivery market. 
“This completes a large part of our quadruple play of data, voice, video and mobility services,” said John 
Chambers, Cisco Systems president and CEO. “Video may be the most critical element in a bundle of services 
in terms of customer stickiness.” He says Cisco hopes to reduce the complexity of bringing those services 
together over one network. 
Cisco has eyed the video market for a number of years, but many traditional video content and distribution 
companies have been hesitant to rely on its line of gear that helps move content as packets of data. Adi Kishore, 
Yankee Group Media and Entertainment analyst, says, “Companies need to understand the MSO and the MSO 
culture. And while Cisco has made some interesting forays into the video side of the business, it has still been 
struggling to create a gold-standard level of credibility. When someone thinks video expertise, Cisco doesn’t pop 
to mind. But S-A are monsters in the video business.” 
Scientific-Atlanta set-top boxes represent a gateway directly into the home. But that's just part of the attraction 
for Cisco. Scientific-Atlanta’s back-end infrastructure products manage large amounts of video and data that 
pass through the cable plant. Thus, Cisco will have a natural place for its IP routers and gear to sit. 
“We’ve been looking for the assets that Scientific-Atlanta provides for a while now and this is a dream come 
true,” says Jeff Spagnola, Cisco VP, service provider marketing. “This actually bolsters the value proposition of 
each of us.” 
The deal is expected to close in about two months, after which Scientific-Atlanta will operate as a division within 
Cisco’s Routing and Service Provider Technology Group. That company is headed up by Cisco Senior VP Mike 
Volpi. Scientific Atlantic Chairman and CEO Jim McDonald will report to Volpi. 
Josh Bernoff, Forrester Research vice president, says Scientific-Atlanta will benefit greatly. Cisco can help the 
company sell more back-end infrastructure gear and push them into retail markets. “This may accelerate the IP 
transition in cable,” he says. “But I have two rules for the cable industry: first, cable goes slow. And even if you 
know rule one, they go slower than you think. But Cisco has been know to innovate and show a market what is 
possible, and that has given them pretty incredible growth and marketshare. And with cable moving in the 
direction of IP it will be a lot easier for Cisco to get into a cable system if it’s Scientific-Atlanta that is telling the 
MSO what they need.”

Cisco Systems agreed Friday to acquire the television technology company Scientific-Atlanta for about $6.9 
billion, according to AP. The deal would be Cisco's second-largest ever. It attempts to capitalize on a business 
set to grow as telecommunications companies use fiber-based networks for distributing pay-television 
programming and where broadcasters are moving to digital television. Scientific-Atlanta is one of two major 
manufacturers, with Motorola, of set-top boxes for television programs and movies on demand. "Video is 
emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple-play bundle of consumer entertainment, 
communication and online services,'' John Chambers, Cisco's president and CEO, said in a statement. Jim 
McDonald, Scientific-Atlanta's president and CEO, said the deal arose in part because customers are now 
expecting bundled services.

NEW YORK, Nov 18, 2005 (DJCS via Comtex) -- 
(UPDATES starting in the fifth paragraph.) 
By Roger Cheng 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) expanded its presence in the service provider and video arena after agreeing to 
purchase set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta Inc. (SFA) for $6.9 billion. 
The acquisition comes at a time when the phone and cable industries gear up to offer a "quadruple play" of 
services - voice, video, Internet and wireless - in an increasingly competitive landscape. The phone companies 
have just begun rolling out video service, while the cable providers are near another upgrade cycle for new pricier 
digital set-top boxes, presenting Cisco with opportunities from both sides. 
"This uniquely positions Cisco for service providers and consumers," said Cisco Chief Executive John 
Chambers during a conference call to discuss the deal. 
San Jose-based Cisco will pay $43 a share, or a 3.7% premium to Scientific-Atlanta's Thursday closing price of 
$41.45, for the Atlanta company. The deal, which will be paid in all cash, is expected to close in during Cisco's 
April quarter. The acquisition will be neutral to Cisco's earnings in fiscal 2006, but slightly accretive on a pro 
forma basis in 2007. 
Despite the pricey deal, Cisco intends to use the remaining $4.3 billion in a stock buyback plan initially approved 
in September. The company has $1.7 billion in cash and $11.8 billion in investments on its balance sheet. In 
addition to tapping its cash hoard, Cisco will use debt to finance the acquisition. The company declined to provide 
additional details on the debt. 
While the deal is considered large, J.P. Morgan analyst Ehud Gelblum said he believes Scientific-Atlanta is 
selling at too low a price. In a note he added he expects other bidders to be interested at this level, including 
consumer electronic companies, telecom equipment vendors and large software players. The analyst, his 
associate or member of their households own a stake in Cisco, and J.P. Morgan expects to receive 
compensation for investment banking services in the next three months. 
By combining Cisco's data networking with Scientific-Atlanta's set-top boxes, it can potentially lock up both 
ends of the cable and phone infrastructure. Cisco already sells networking equipment at the central office, and 
will now be able to address to the consumer end with Scientific-Atlanta. 
"This is certainly a consumer-oriented play," said Rob Whiteley, a networking analyst for Forrester Research. 
Cisco's consumer routing business, Linksys, will likely drag Scientific-Atlanta's set-top business in the retail 
arena. Cisco already has a working distribution chain with Linksys - its products are readily available in stores 
such as Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY) - and bringing set-top boxes integrated with features such as digital recorders 
and wireless capabilities could be the next step. 
"Essentially, you have one box you can plug your cable into," Whiteley said. 
Cisco had made a prior dip in the digital media sector with its $61 million acquisition of privately held KiSS 
Technology A/S in July. The technology, which dealt with the transmission of video content over the Internet, was 
folded into the Linksys business.

Ultimately, Cisco backing up Scientific-Atlanta will likely spur innovation throughout all of the industries. 
Traditionally, the cable companies have been hesitant to look at new technologies, something Scientific-Atlanta 
has been seriously pushing for. But the phone companies have begun offering video services based on 
more-advanced Internet networks, which some believe will spur cable companies to make their own moves. 
"While Comcast doesn't have to respond to Time Warner on upgrades, it'll have to respond to the phone 
companies in their territories," Whiteley said. "The hammer they'll use to nail (Internet protocol) is the telephone 
industry, which will be more open to an IP-based system." 
Scientific-Atlanta's aggressive push into new features and Internet video-capable set-top boxes will likely push 
rival Motorola Inc. (MOT) to speed its own innovation. 
"This sends a clear signal to Motorola that it needs to speed up its IPTV story," Whiteley said. "Motorola has the 
largest IP vendor in the world backing up its competition." 
Motorola holds a slight edge in market share over Scientific-Atlanta in the set-top box business. 
While analyst sentiment has been positive, some believe there are still considerable challenges to integrating the 
two companies. This marks Cisco's second-largest acquisition, and largest in five years. The biggest deal was for 
fiber-optic start-up Cerent Corp., which it acquired for more than $7 billion in 1999. The company is known for 
acquiring small private companies for their intellectual property and personnel talent. 
"We are mixed on the deal, as the move into cable is logical, but there are integration risks and the margin profile 
moves lower as Cisco's business to the consumer increases," Banc of America Securities analyst Tim Long said 
in a research note Friday. The analyst doesn't own a stake in Cisco, but his firm has an investment-banking 
relationship with the company. 
It appears the two companies are approaching integration slowly. Executives said both companies will continue to 
operate independently for the first two years after the acquisition. Also, Scientific-Atlanta's chief executive, 
James McDonald, agreed to stay with the newly combined company for two years. 
Ideally, "we would like to see a melding of operations," said Lawrence Harris, an analyst who follows the cable 
equipment industry at Oppenheimer, but that won't happen for a while. Near-term, Cisco said it start to use 
Scientific-Atlanta's manufacturing facility in Mexico. The move could cut down on shipping costs since it's closer 
to Cisco's U.S. customers. 
The Scientific-Atlanta acquisition is the seventh-largest all-cash deal in the U.S. this year. Privately held Koch 
Industries Inc.'s agreement to pay $13.2 billion for Georgia-Pacific Corp. (GP) was the largest. 
Scientific-Atlanta recently traded at $42.14, up 69 cents, or 1.7%, on volume of 17 million shares. Average daily 
volume is 1.3 million shares. 
Cisco recently traded at $16.98, down 38 cents, or 2.2%, on volume of 102.4 million shares. Average daily 
volume is 51.3 million shares.

Cisco Systems, the world's biggest maker of internet routing and switching equipment, on Friday moved to sieze 
control of the digital home with a $6.9bn (GBP4bn, ?5.9bn) deal to buy Scientific-Atlanta, a US maker of cable 
televison boxes. 
The all-cash deal would set the stage for Cisco to offer a platform that combines digital video, telephone, data 
and wireless services across a single network inside the home. 
Demand for such services is expected to drive a new wave of growth in data services as increasing numbers of 
households connect to the internet via faster broadband connections. 
"Video is emerging as a key application," said John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive. "The opportunity for 
Cisco is to dramatically reduce the complexity of converging data, voice, video and IP in both a fixed and mobile 
environment." 
Ragu Gurumurthy, an analyst at Adventis, a telecommunications and digital media consultancy, said the deal 
would be "phenomental" for Cisco, which has been struggling to meet growth targets amid flagging sales of its 
core routing and switching equipment. 
"[Cisco's] penetration of the service provider market over the last five years has been mediocre at best," said Mr 
Gurumurthy. "This is the right move for them." 
However, one analyst expressed concern that Cisco's offer price could leave the deal open to rivals bids. 
Ehud Gelblum at JP Morgan said in a research note that Scientific-Atlanta's sale price of $43 per share - a 3.7 
per cent premium over Thursday's closing price - was "much too low." 
"At this price point we would expect other bidders to be interested and surface, including large consumer 
electrnoic companies, teleocm equipment vendors and large software players interested in home media 
entertainment," Mr Gelblum wrote. 
One such company could be Motorola, Scientific-Atlanta's chief rival in the set-top cable box market. 
Scientific-Atlanta is the second-largest maker of set-top boxes that allow consumers to digitally record TV 
broadcasts for viewing at their chosen time. 
Strong demand for such services has forced television networks to re-think business models based on viewing 
hours and advertising viewership. It comes on the heels of growth in voice-over-internet telephony and wireless 
technologies. 
Friday's announcement marks Cisco's most significant move into the fast-growing consumer market for digital 
services since its $500m acquisition of Linksys, a maker of wireless internet routers, in 2003. 
Cisco said it expected the deal to close in the third quarter of 2006. It said is was not likely to have an impact on 
earnings for that fiscal year. The deal will be financed through a combination of cash and debt. 
Shares in Scientific-Atlanta rose 1.7 per cent to $42.14 on news of the deal. Cisco's shares fell 2.2 per cent to 
$16.99.

Cisco Systems, the networking equipment and technology group, said on Friday it would buy Scientific Atlanta, 
a maker of video and other content distribution technology for about $6.9bn in a bid to access the fast-growing 
market for converged television, telephone and internet services over broadband networks. 
Cisco agreed to pay $43 per Scientific-Atlanta share, at a 3.7 per cent premium over the company's closing 
price on Thursday. 
Scientific-Atlanta is the second-largest maker of set-top boxes that allow consumers to digitally record TV 
broadcasts for viewing at their chosen time. The fast growth of these digital video recording (DVR) services has 
come on the heels of growth of voice-over-internet telephony services as an increasing number of households 
have opted to connect to the internet via faster broadband networks. 
DVR growth is forcing television networks to re-think business models based on viewing hours and advertising 
viewership. Cisco is betting that the trend will result in higher demand for the equipment and technology to 
support this trend. 
John Chambers, Cisco' chief executive, said: "As consumers demand more sophisticated information and 
entertainment services in their home, tightly coupled applications, devices and networks will be essential." 
With its largest acquisition since the $7.3bn takeover of Cerent in 1999, Cisco is betting that a foray into bundled 
networking services for consumers, cable television and telecommunications companies will boost earnings. 
Sales for its core routing and switching equipment have been flagging and have thwarted Cisco sales growth 
closer to its stated goal of 10 to 15 per cent . 
Scientific-Atlanta was chosen by SBC Communications in August as a provider of set-top boxes for its 
television-over-internet service alongside Microsoft, the software giant. 
Cisco said the transaction was expected to be closed in the third quarter of 2006 and would have no impact on its 
earnings for that fiscal year. The deal will be financed through a combination of cash and debt, the company said.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) expanded its presence in the service provider and video

The Scientific-Atlanta acquisition is the seventh-largest all-cash deal in the U.S. this year. Privately held Koch

Scientific-Atlanta recently traded at $42.14, up 69 cents, or 1.7%, on volume of 17 million shares. Average daily 
volume is 1.3 million shares. 
Cisco recently traded at $16.98, down 38 cents, or 2.2%, on volume of 102.4 million shares. Average daily 
volume is 51.3 million shares.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) expanded its presence in the service provider and video 
arena after agreeing to purchase set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta Inc. (SFA) for $6.9 billion. 
The acquisition comes at a time when the phone and cable industries gear up to offer a "quadruple play" of 
services - voice, video, Internet and wireless - in an increasingly competitive landscape. The phone companies 
have just begun rolling out video service, while the cable providers are near another upgrade cycle for new pricier 
digital set-top boxes, presenting Cisco with opportunities from both sides. 
"This uniquely positions Cisco for service providers and consumers," said Cisco Chief Executive John 
Chambers during a conference call to discuss the deal. 
San Jose-based Cisco will pay $43 a share, or a 3.7% premium to Scientific-Atlanta's Thursday closing price of 
$41.45, for the Atlanta company. The deal, which will be paid in all cash, is expected to close in during Cisco's 
April quarter. The acquisition will be neutral to Cisco's earnings in fiscal 2006, but slightly accretive on a pro 
forma basis in 2007. 
Despite the pricey deal, Cisco intends to use the remaining $4.3 billion in a stock buyback plan initially approved 
in September. The company has $1.7 billion in cash and $11.8 billion in investments on its balance sheet. In 
addition tapping its cash hoard, Cisco will use debt to finance the acquisition. 
By combining Cisco's data networking with Scientific-Atlanta's set-top boxes, it can potentially lock up both 
ends of the cable and phone infrastructure. Cisco already sells networking equipment at the central office, and 
will now be able to address to the consumer end with Scientific-Atlanta. 
"This is certainly a consumer-oriented play," said Rob Whiteley, a networking analyst for Forrester Research. 
Cisco's consumer routing business, Linksys, will likely drag Scientific-Atlanta's set-top business in the retail 
arena. Cisco already has a working distribution chain with Linksys - its products are readily available in stores 
such as Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY) - and bringing set-top boxes integrated with features such as digital recorders 
and wireless capabilities could be the next step. 
"Essentially, you have one box you can plug your cable into," Whiteley said. 
Cisco had made a prior dip in the digital media sector with its $61 million acquisition of privately held KiSS 
Technology A/S in July. The technology, which dealt with the transmission of video content over the Internet, was 
folded into the Linksys business. 
Ultimately, Cisco backing up Scientific-Atlanta will likely spur innovation throughout all of the industries. 
Traditionally, the cable companies have been hesitant to look at new technologies, something Scientific-Atlanta 
has been seriously pushing for. But the phone companies have begun offering video services based on more 
advanced Internet networks, which some believe will spur cable companies to make their own moves.

"While Comcast doesn't have to respond to Time Warner on upgrades, it'll have to respond to the phone 
companies in their territories," Whiteley said. "The hammer they'll use to nail (Internet protocol) is the telephone 
industry, which will be more open to an IP-based system." 
Scientific-Atlanta's aggressive push into new features and Internet video-capable set-top boxes will likely push 
rival Motorola Inc. (MOT) to speed its own innovation. 
"This sends a clear signal to Motorola that it needs to speed up its IPTV story," Whiteley said. "Motorola has the 
largest IP vendor in the world backing up its competition." 
Motorola holds a slight edge in market share over Scientific-Atlanta in the set-top box business. 
While analyst sentiment has been positive, some believe there are still considerable challenges to integrating the 
two companies. This marks Cisco's second-largest acquisition, and largest in five years. The biggest deal was for 
fiber-optic start-up Cerent Corp., which it acquired for more than $7 billion in 1999. The company is known for 
acquiring small private companies for their intellectual property and personnel talent. 
"We are mixed on the deal, as the move into cable is logical, but there are integration risks and the margin profile 
moves lower as Cisco's business to the consumer increases," Banc of America Securities analyst Tim Long said 
in a research note Friday. The analyst doesn't have any conflicts of interest to report. 
It appears the two companies are approaching integration slowly. Executives said both companies will continue to 
operate independently for the first two years after the acquisition. Also, Scientific-Atlanta's chief executive, 
James McDonald, agreed to stay with the newly combined company for two years. 
Ideally, "we would like to see a melding of operations," said Lawrence Harris, an analyst who follows the cable 
equipment industry at Oppenheimer, but that won't happen for a while. Near-term, Cisco said it start to use 
Scientific-Atlanta's manufacturing facility in Mexico. The move could cut down on shipping costs since it's closer 
to Cisco's U.S. customers. 
The Scientific-Atlanta acquisition is the seventh-largest all-cash deal in the U.S. this year. Privately held Koch 
Industries Inc.'s agreement to pay $13.2 billion for Georgia-Pacific Corp. (GP) was the largest. 
Scientific-Atlanta recently traded at $42.14, up 69 cents, or 1.7%, on volume of 17 million shares. Average daily 
volume is 1.3 million shares. 
Cisco recently traded at $16.98, down 38 cents, or 2.2%, on volume of 102.4 million shares. Average daily 
volume is 51.3 million shares.

NEW YORK (AP)--Cisco Systems Inc. agreed Friday to acquire the cable TV technology company 
Scientific-Atlanta Inc. for about $6.9 billion in a move that would create a one-stop shop--and market leader--in 
distributing television to living rooms over the Internet. 
The deal, which is Cisco's second largest ever, is an attempt to capitalize on a business that's expected to 
explode as telephone companies deploy fiber-based networks capable of carrying TV signals and the broadcast 
industry as a whole shifts to digital transmissions. 
Cisco is paying $43 a share for Scientific-Atlanta, one of the largest makers of set-top boxes for television 
programs and movies-on-demand. That is a 3.7 percent premium over its closing price on Thursday. 
Scientific-Atlanta shares rose 74 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $42.19 in morning trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, while Cisco shares slipped 23 cents to $17.14 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication, and online services," said John Chambers, Cisco president and chief executive, 
in a statement. "The addition of Scientific-Atlanta further extends Cisco's commitment to and leadership in the 
service provider market." 
Cisco said Scientific-Atlanta will become a division of its routing and service provider technology group, led by 
Cisco Senior Vice President Mike Volpi. 
Jim McDonald, Scientific-Atlanta's president and chief executive, said the deal arose in part because customers 
are now expecting bundled services. 
"These customers want more complete integrated solutions from fewer vendors," said McDonald, who said he will 
remain with the company for two years. 
He said the purchase will help Cisco reduce the complexity of data transfer to service providers and other 
customers. 
The deal, which was approved by the boards of both companies, is expected to close in the third quarter of 
Cisco's fiscal 2006 calendar, pending closing conditions. 
San Jose, Calif.-based Cisco said it expects the deal to be neutral to its fiscal 2006 earnings, while slightly 
boosting its fiscal 2007 profit before items. Cisco said it will finance the transaction with cash and debt. 
Analysts expect Cisco to earn $1.03 per share for fiscal 2006, and $1.18 per share for fiscal 2007, according to a 
Thomson Financial survey. 
Scientific-Atlanta said last month that its fiscal first-quarter profit grew 9 percent to $60.7 million, but sales of 
$490 million fell shy of Wall Street's expectations. 
Earlier this month, Cisco said its fiscal first-quarter profit slipped as it expensed employee stock options for the 
first time and the company predicted weaker-than-expected sales. The company has its core business of routers 
and switches that direct data traffic over the Internet as well as its advanced technologies such as storage, 
wireless, and security products. 
Cisco has been working on a half dozen, so-called advanced technologies that enhance its routers and switches. 
It's betting the technologies can each generate revenue of $1 billion or more each year. Cisco also plans to 
announce additional advanced technologies before the end of calendar 2005.

The buying spree by Swiss Re, Cisco, and Alltel was unusual for a Friday. 
Call it merger Friday. 
At least three major deals exceeding $1 billion were announced on November 18, buoying the overall stock 
market, which surged in the first few hours on the news. The deal activity was somewhat surprising for a Friday. 
Generally, the most active day for official announcements is Monday, as many companies like to take the 
weekend to finalize their transactions. 
The largest deal announced was Swiss Re's agreement to buy GE Insurance Solutions, the fifth-largest reinsurer 
worldwide, from General Electric Co. for $6.8 billion in cash and stock. Under the deal, Swiss Re will also assume 
$1.7 billion in debt. 
Cisco Systems, known for making many small acquisitions each year, will acquire Scientific-Atlanta Inc., a 
provider of cable television set-top boxes, for $6.9 billion. The agreement calls for Cisco to pay $43 in cash for 
each share of Scientific-Atlanta stock, as well as assume outstanding options. The purchase price works out to 
$5.3 billion net of Scientific-Atlanta's existing cash balance. 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service-provider triple play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication, and online services," says John Chambers, president and chief executive officer 
of Cisco. "The combination of Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta brings unmatched experience and innovation in 
delivering large-scale video systems and networks, and the addition of Scientific-Atlanta further extends Cisco's 
commitment to and leadership in the service-provider market." 
In the third deal, Alltel, owner and operator of the nation's largest wireless network, will acquire privately held 
Midwest Wireless Holdings for nearly $1.1 billion in cash. Alltel officials say the company expects to gain 
approximately 400,000 wireless customers in southern Minnesota, northern and eastern Iowa, and western 
Wisconsin. These markets are contiguous to existing Alltel operations and cover a population of 1.9 million. 
Meanwhile, Liz Claiborne Inc. made a hostile $366 million offer to buy The J. Jill Group Inc. The all-cash offer, 
representing a 40 percent premium over J. Jill's closing share price on Thursday, came after two years of friendly 
overtures were spurned, say officials at Liz Claiborne.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - Cisco Systems Inc. agreed Friday to acquire set-top-box maker Scientific-Atlanta Inc. 
for about $6.9 billion in a move that would create a one-stop shop -- and a market leader -- in distributing 
television to living rooms over the Internet. 
The deal, Cisco's largest in terms of revenue and headcount, capitalizes on a business that's expected to 
explode as telephone companies deploy fiber-based networks capable of carrying TV signals and broadcasters 
shift to digital transmissions. 
It fits into Cisco's strategy of expanding into areas that are moving toward standards on the language of the 
Internet. 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication and online services," said John Chambers, Cisco president and chief executive. 
"The addition of Scientific-Atlanta further extends Cisco's commitment to and leadership in the service provider 
market." 
For Scientific-Atlanta, the deal is expected to bring more capital and fuel its expansion beyond cable TV 
companies that have been relatively slow to introduce new technologies to customers, said Josh Bernoff, an 
analyst at Forrester Research. 
"Cisco has struggled to succeed both with telephone and cable companies. Scientific-Atlanta is sort of in a 
position where innovation and capital push would be helpful for them," he said. "We think this is going to make 
some real changes in the industry." 
Cisco is paying $43 a share for Scientific-Atlanta, which competes primarily against Motorola Inc. in making 
set-top boxes for television programs and movies-on-demand. That is a 3.7 percent premium over its closing 
price on Thursday. 
Scientific-Atlanta shares rose 68 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $42.13 in late morning trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, while Cisco shares slipped 38 cents to $16.99 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Cisco said Scientific-Atlanta will become a division of its routing and service provider technology group, led by 
Cisco Senior Vice President Mike Volpi. It also identified it as the eighth of its "advanced technologies," which 
means it expects the business to generate more than a billion dollars in revenue within five to seven years. 
Jim McDonald, Scientific-Atlanta's president and chief executive, said the deal arose in part because customers 
are now expecting bundled services. 
"These customers want more complete integrated solutions from fewer vendors," said McDonald, who said he will

(UPDATES with background information starting in the 9th paragraph.) 
By Roger Cheng 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) expanded its presence in the service provider and video arena after agreeing to 
purchase set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta Inc. (SFA) for $6.9 billion. 
The acquisition comes at a time when the phone and cable industries gear up to offer a "quadruple play" of 
services - voice, video, Internet and wireless - in an increasingly competitive landscape. The phone companies 
have just begun rolling out video service, while the cable providers are near another upgrade cycle for new pricier 
digital set-top boxes, presenting Cisco with opportunities from both sides. 
"This uniquely positions Cisco for service providers and consumers," said Cisco Chief Executive John 
Chambers during a conference call to discuss the deal. 
San Jose-based Cisco will pay $43 a share, or a 3.7% premium to Scientific-Atlanta's Thursday closing price of 
$41.45, for the Atlanta company. The deal, which will be paid in all cash, is expected to close in during Cisco's 
April quarter. The acquisition will be neutral to Cisco's earnings in fiscal 2006, but slightly accretive on a pro 
forma basis in 2007. 
By combining Cisco's data networking with Scientific-Atlanta's set-top boxes, it can potentially lock up both 
ends of the cable and phone infrastructure. Cisco already sells networking equipment at the central office, and 
will now be able to address to the consumer end with Scientific-Atlanta. 
"This is certainly a consumer-oriented play," said Rob Whiteley, a networking analyst for Forrester Research. 
Cisco's consumer routing business, Linksys, will likely drag Scientific-Atlanta's set-top business in the retail 
arena. Cisco already has a working distribution chain with Linksys - its products are readily available in stores 
such as Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY) - and bringing set-top boxes integrated with features such as digital recorders 
and wireless capabilities could be the next step. 
"Essentially, you have one box you can plug your cable into," Whiteley said. 
Cisco had made a prior dip in the digital media sector with its $61 million acquisition of privately held KiSS 
Technology A/S in July. The technology, which dealt with the transmission of video content over the Internet, was 
folded into the Linksys business. 
Ultimately, Cisco backing up Scientific-Atlanta will likely spur innovation throughout all of the industries. 
Traditionally, the cable companies have been hesitant to look at new technologies, something Scientific-Atlanta 
has been seriously pushing for. But the phone companies have begun offering video services based on more 
advanced Internet networks, which some believe will spur cable companies to make their own moves. 
"While Comcast doesn't have to respond to Time Warner on upgrades, it'll have to respond to the phone 
companies in their territories," Whiteley said. "The hammer they'll use to nail (Internet protocol) is the telephone 
industry, which will be more open to an IP-based system."

Scientific-Atlanta's aggressive push into new features and Internet video-capable set-top boxes will likely push 
rival Motorola Inc. (MOT) to speed its own innovation. 
"This sends a clear signal to Motorola that it needs to speed up its IPTV story," Whiteley said. "Motorola has the 
largest IP vendor in the world backing up its competition." 
Motorola holds a slight edge in market share over Scientific-Atlanta in the set-top box business. 
While analyst sentiment has been positive, some believe there are still considerable challenges to integrating the 
two companies. This marks Cisco's second-largest acquisition, and largest in five years. The biggest deal was for 
fiber-optic start-up Cerent Corp., which it acquired for more than $7 billion in 1999. The company is known for 
acquiring small private companies for their intellectual property and personnel talent. 
"We are mixed on the deal, as the move into cable is logical, but there are integration risks and the margin profile 
moves lower as Cisco's business to the consumer increases," Banc of America Securities analyst Tim Long said 
in a research note Friday. The analyst doesn't have any conflicts of interest to report. 
The Scientific-Atlanta acquisition is the seventh-largest all-cash deal in the U.S. this year. Privately held Koch 
Industries Inc.'s agreement to pay $13.2 billion for Georgia-Pacific Corp. (GP) was the largest. 
Scientific-Atlanta recently traded at $42.13, up 67 cents, or 1.6%, on volume of 13.8 million shares. Average 
daily volume is 1.3 million shares. 
Cisco recently traded at $16.99, down 38 cents, or 2.2%, on volume of 82.6 million shares. Average daily volume 
is 51.3 million shares.

Cisco Systems Inc. is buying its way into the cable set-top business, agreeing to acquire Scientific-Atlanta Inc. 
for $6.9 billion in cash. 
Much like Motorola Inc.’s purchase of General Instrument Corp. and its set-top division five years ago, the deal 
puts a major cable set-top vendor inside a multibillion-dollar company with larger broadband-product lines and 
significantly wider worldwide reach. 
Cisco CEO John Chambers, during a conference call on the deal Friday, stressed the company’s ability to offer 
broadband providers worldwide an end-to-end video solution. “This will reduce the complexity of merging video, 
voice and data over IP [Internet-protocol] networks,” he said. 
“Customers want integrated solutions,” said S-A chairman Jim McDonald, who agreed to stay on for two years 
after the deal closes. 
S-A will join the router and technology group inside Cisco and sit alongside Cisco’s most recent cable-related 
acquisition, home-networking company Linksys. Cisco already generates about $1 billion in sales from cable for 
its router and cable-modem-termination-system business. 
The $43-per-share price is only about 4% over where S-A’s stock closed Thursday, but it had run up in recent 
days on sale speculation.

NEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc. said on Friday it had agreed to buy Scientific-Atlanta Inc., 
a leading U.S. maker of cable television set-top boxes, for $6.9 billion in cash in a deal that would move the 
networking equipment giant more deeply into the consumer market. 
Cisco will pay $43 a share, a 3.7 percent premium over Thursday's closing price of $41.45 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Scientific-Atlanta stock has risen over 20 percent in the past month on speculation it would be 
bought. 
Cisco said its net cost would be $5.3 billion, after subtracting Scientific-Atlanta's existing cash balance. It also 
plans to assume outstanding options, under the agreement. 
The deal was approved by both boards, and is expected to close in the third quarter of Cisco's fiscal year 2006. 
Cisco said the acquisition would be neutral to its 2006 earnings, and add slightly to 2007 profit, excluding certain 
items. 
The deal is part of Cisco's ongoing efforts to find new technologies and businesses to spark higher revenue 
growth and boost the company's stock. 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication and online services," Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said in a statement. 
Motorola Inc. is Scientific-Atlanta's biggest competitor in the set-top box market.

SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones) - Cisco Systems Inc. said Friday it agreed to buy cable television set-top box 
maker Scientific-Atlanta Inc. for $6.9 billion, adding a leading maker of products that let consumers receive 
high-speed Internet service over cable. 
Cisco (CSCO) offered $43 a share in cash for Scientific-Atlanta (SFA) and agreed to assume all of the 
company's outstanding stock options. Excluding the $1.55 billion in cash on Scientific-Atlanta's balance sheet, 
Cisco will be paying $5.3 billion. 
In early trading, Cisco shares fell 28 cents to $17.09. Scientific-Atlanta, which has climbed over 25% from 
October lows on rumors of a deal, rose 65 cents to $42.10. 
Cisco, the top maker of networking equipment, is pushing into the market for low-cost gear for consumers and 
small businesses as broadband connections increase. 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple-play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication and online services," said John Chambers, president and chief executive officer 
of Cisco Systems. 
Scientific-Atlanta, of Lawrenceville, Ga., is the second largest provider of TV set-top boxes behind Motorola. It 
also sells digital video recorders and cable modems. Its top customers include Time Warner (TWX), Cablevision 
Systems, and Comcast Corp. 
The company, founded in 1951 by six engineers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, has annual revenue of 
about $1.9 billion. 
While sales of Cisco's low-cost gear are growing faster than sales to corporate customers and phone companies, 
however, they are less profitable and still contribute less than a fifth of the firm's revenue. 
The San Jose, Calif.-based company still gets nearly half its revenue by selling data switches to corporations, 
while another quarter or so comes from sales of Internet routers. 
Cisco shares have hovered more-than-two year lows since it forecast that sales in the fiscal year ending in July 
2006 would rise in the low double-digits. 
It expects the deal will be neutral to fiscal 2006 earnings and slightly lift adjusted 2007 earnings. [ 11-18-05

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) expanded its presence in the service provider and video 
arena after agreeing to purchase set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta Inc. (SFA) for $6.9 billion. 
The acquisition comes at a time when the phone and cable industries gear up to offer a "quadruple play" of 
services - voice, video, Internet and wireless - in an increasingly competitive landscape. The phone companies 
have just begun rolling out video service, while the cable providers are near another upgrade cycle for new pricier 
digital set-top boxes, presenting Cisco with opportunities from both sides. 
"This uniquely positions Cisco for service providers and consumers," said Cisco Chief Executive John

Cisco CEO Looks To Gain Share Of Customer Capex With Deal

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The combination of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) and Scientific-Atlanta Inc. (SFA) will 
help the companies gain share in their customers' capital spending budgets as they offer a more integrated 
system, Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said. 
The industries that each company serves - Cisco with networking and Scientific-Atlanta with video - is slowly 
converging, Chambers said during a Webcast to discuss the deal Friday. The deal will help create an 
"end-to-end" system, he said. 
"This uniquely positions Cisco for service providers and consumers," Chambers said, adding that the few carriers 
he talked with about the deal were optimistic. 
Scientific-Atlanta Chief Executive Jim McDonald echoed Chambers' comments. 
"There is a tremendous opportunity to grow the business," he said, adding the deal better positions the company 
to expand its markets. 
Earlier Friday, Cisco said it had agreed to acquire Scientific-Atlanta for $6.9 billion, or $43 a share, in cash. The 
terms represent a 3.7% premium to Thursday's closing price of $41.45. The deal is expected to close in the third 
quarter of Cisco's fiscal year, which ends in April, and is neutral to fiscal 2006 earnings and slightly accretive in 
fiscal 2007. 
The merger combines the San Jose, Calif., networking giant with one of the two major set-top box makers in the 
cable equipment business. Cisco is acquiring the company as the lines between the Internet and television blurs, 
with phone carriers such as SBC Communications Inc. (SBC) offering Internet video service. The set-top box is 
seen as the gateway controlling the kind of content that flows into the TV. 
Video is a critical area for Cisco's move to provide a "quadruple play" of services - video, voice, Internet and 
wireless. Chambers said the video segment could be a $10 billion market in 2009, and he sees annual revenue 
growth of 12% to 16% between fiscal 2007 and 2010. [ 11-18-05 0915ET ] 
One concern revolves around the lower margins offered by Scientific-Atlanta's business. While the margins 
won't likely rise as high as Cisco's core business, Cisco CEO Chambers said the integrated product line should 
see higher margins. 
Cisco will be able to use its relationships with international customers to help expand Scientific-Atlanta's 
market, Chambers said. The 12% to 16% compound annual growth rate factors in those potential new markets. 
He noted in Cisco's business, the international market was showing faster growth than in the U.S. 
"This is clearly an area we can get a lot of acceleration," Scientific-Atlanta's McDonald said. "The combined 
strength and resources will position us to more quickly address market opportunities." 
Currently, revenue from service providers represents 20% of Cisco's business, while the consumer market, 
mainly sold through its Linksys home routing line, makes up 4%. Both areas are seen as key drivers for future 
growth, Chambers said. 
Cisco will not make any changes to Scientific-Atlanta's organizational structure for the next two years, 
Chambers said. He noted the company has a history of integrating the work force it gains through acquisitions.

McDonald noted that both companies have similar corporate cultures, both heavily tilted towards engineers, and 
showing low turnover rates. McDonald has signed on to stay for two years, and Scientific-Atlanta's senior 
management has signed on to stay with Cisco.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Dow Jones)--Internet equipment provider Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) signed a definitive 
agreement to acquire Scientific-Atlanta Inc. (SFA), a maker of television set-top boxes, for $43 a share. 
Cisco said in a press release Friday it also will assume outstanding Scientific-Atlanta options in the deal, for a 
total purchase price of about $6.9 billion. Net of Scientific-Atlanta's existing cash balance, the deal is valued at 
$5.3 billion. 
The Wall Street Journal reported in its Friday editions that the companies were near a deal last night, according to 
people familiar with the matter. 
The $43-a-share price of the transaction represents a 4% premium to Scientific-Atlanta's Thursday closing price 
of $41.45. 
In premarket trading on Inet, Scientific-Atlanta was trading at $42.50, up 2.5% from Thursday's close. 
Cisco's shares were trading at $17.30, down 7 cents, or 0.4%, from Thursday's closing price of $17.37. [ 
11-18-05 0813ET ] 
Cisco Systems said the acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta is expected to close in its fiscal 2006 third quarter, 
which ends in April. The deal will be financed with a combination of cash and debt. 
The transaction has been approved by the boards of both companies, but is subject to standard closing 
conditions, including antitrust clearance and approval from Scientific-Atlanta shareholders. 
Cisco expects the deal to be neutral to fiscal 2006 earnings and to slightly add to fiscal 2007 non-GAAP 
earnings. 
Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call, on average, expect the company to earn $1.03 a share in fiscal 2006 
and $1.18 a share in fiscal 2007. 
For its fiscal year ended July 30, the company reported net income of $5.7 billion, or 87 cents a share, on 
revenue of $24.8 billion. Excluding items, earnings were $6.1 billion, or 92 cents a share. [ 11-18-05 0826ET ] 
The Wall Street Journal reported the deal illustrates the growing trend of equipment makers taking advantage of 
evaporating lines between the Internet, television and telephone industries. 
Cisco has targeted becoming the leading equipment supplier as the Internet evolves to take over functions that 
were long carried out by separate entertainment, voice and data networks, the Journal said. But in doing so, it has 
to penetrate an area that has been dominated by Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola Inc. (MOT). 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple-play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication and online services," Cisco President and Chief Executive John Chambers said 
in Friday's statement. "The combination of Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta brings unmatched experience and 
innovation in delivering large-scale video systems and networks, and the addition of Scientific-Atlanta further 
extends Cisco's commitment to and leadership in the service provider market." 
He added Cisco's international presence and Internet protocol leadership will "create strategic synergies that 
accelerate the combined growth opportunity." [ 11-18-05 0845ET ]

Page 137 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Scientific-Atlanta Chairman, Chief Executive and President James McDonald said the transaction will benefit the 
company's shareholders, customers and employees. 
"The combined strengths and resources of our two companies will position us to address more quickly the 
growing number of opportunities in the markets we serve and enable us to create new products and services that 
might not have existed otherwise," he added. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, Scientific-Atlanta has about 40% of the U.S. set-top market, or roughly 56 
million cable devices in U.S. households. Its largest customer is Time Warner Inc.'s (TWX) cable division. 
In the months preceding completion of the deal, the companies will continue to operate as separate businesses, 
working with their existing partners. 
After the transaction closes, Scientific-Atlanta will become a division of Cisco's routing and service provider 
technology group, which is headed by Senior Vice President Michael Volpi. McDonald will report directly to Volpi. 
Cisco said it is committed to "retaining the relationships and go-to-market strategies that both companies have 
developed."

SAN JOSE, Calif. & LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. - (BUSINESS WIRE) - Nov. 18, 2005 - Cisco Systems, Inc. 
(NASDAQ:CSCO), and Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. (NYSE:SFA), today announced a definitive agreement for Cisco 
to acquire Scientific-Atlanta. Scientific-Atlanta is a leading global provider of set-top boxes, end-to-end video 
distribution networks and video system integration. The combined entity creates a world class, end-to-end triple 
play solution for carrier networks and the digital home. In addition, upon closure, the market opportunities 
represented by this acquisition will become part of Cisco's Advanced Technology portfolio. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Cisco will pay $43 per share in cash in exchange for each share of 
Scientific-Atlanta, and assume outstanding options, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $6.9 
billion, or approximately $5.3 billion net of Scientific-Atlanta's existing cash balance. The transaction will be 
accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the acquisition of 
Scientific-Atlanta is expected to close in the third quarter of Cisco's fiscal year 2006. Cisco anticipates this 
transaction will be neutral to its FY2006 earnings, slightly accretive to its non-GAAP (pro forma) FY2007 earnings, 
and will be financed with a combination of cash and debt. The acquisition has been approved by the board of 
directors of each company and is subject to various standard closing conditions, including approval under Hart 
Scott Rodino and similar laws outside the U.S. and by the shareholders of Scientific-Atlanta. 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication and online services," said John Chambers, president and chief executive officer 
of Cisco Systems. "The combination of Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta brings unmatched experience and 
innovation in delivering large scale video systems and networks, and the addition of Scientific-Atlanta further 
extends Cisco's commitment to and leadership in the service provider market. Moreover, Cisco's international 
presence and IP leadership will also create strategic synergies that accelerate the combined growth opportunity." 
Chambers continued, "As consumers demand more sophisticated information and entertainment services in their 
home, tightly coupled applications, devices and networks will be essential. The collective strength of Linksys and 
Scientific-Atlanta will extend Cisco's leadership position across the entire networked digital home." 
"We believe that this combination of Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta will benefit our shareholders, our customers 
and our employees," said Jim McDonald, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Scientific-Atlanta. 
"The combined strengths and resources of our two companies will position us to address more quickly the 
growing number of opportunities in the markets we serve and enable us to create new products and services that 
might not have existed otherwise." 
Scientific-Atlanta has platforms and technologies that enable scaling to millions of subscribers quickly and 
easily. This, along with the Cisco IP Next Generation Network architecture, will offer providers an open platform 
for service differentiation, allowing them to move beyond video/IPTV to develop and deliver a variety of integrated 
media services in the connected home. 
Following the close of the transaction, Scientific-Atlanta will become a division of the Routing and Service 
Provider Technology Group under the leadership of Cisco Senior Vice President Mike Volpi. Jim McDonald will 
report directly to Mr. Volpi. 
Prior to the close, Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta will operate as separate businesses and will continue to work 
with their existing partners. Following the close of the transaction, Cisco is committed to retaining the 
relationships and go-to-market strategies that both companies have developed.

has more than 7500 employees. For FY2005, which ended July 1, 2005, Scientific-Atlanta reported revenues of

Cisco Systems buying Scientific-Atlanta for about $6.9 billion

SAN JOSE, California (AP) - Betting that video will drive the future of networking, Cisco Systems Inc. agreed 
Friday to buy the cable television technology company Scientific-Atlanta Inc. in a $6.9 billion (euro5.91 billion) 
deal that would create a one-stop shop for sending TV over the Internet. 
The acquisition is expected to help fuel the revolution in how TV is distributed and watched -- a change that's 
accelerating as telephone companies barge into the domain of cable operators and begin offering programming 
over fiber-optic networks using the language of the Internet. 
It also fits Cisco's strategy of expanding into technologies that are moving away from their own networks to the 
standards-based Internet -- a shift that creates an opportunity to increase revenue with new business and 
enhance sales its traditional routers and switches that direct data over the Internet. 
"Over the next two or three years, we are going to see a dramatic change in the landscape, where 
video-over-broadband infrastructure becomes the centerpiece of investments that service providers make and the 
expectations that consumers have," said Mike Volpi, a Cisco senior vice president. 
For providers and consumers, Internet-based television promises expanded choices, lower costs and new 
services in the same way voice over the Internet Protocol has made phone calls less expensive and enabled 
features that were not possible with the traditional telephone network. 
The deal also opens up opportunities for Cisco's Linksys home networking division. Its products could be made to 
work seamlessly with Scientific-Atlanta boxes to distribute television throughout the home and combine them 
with other Internet-protocol technologies, including phone service. 
"Today's announcement represents much more than an exciting opportunity for Cisco," said John Chambers, 
Cisco's chief executive officer. "It literally completes a large part of our quadruple play as data, voice, video and 
mobility converge." 
It is Cisco's largest acquisition ever in terms of head count and revenue. The company is paying $43 a share for 
Scientific-Atlanta -- a 3.7 percent premium over its closing price on Thursday. The Atlanta company has about 
7,500 employees and posted $1.91 billion (euro1.64 billion) in sales in fiscal 2005. 
Scientific-Atlanta shares rose 70 cents, or 1.7 percent, to close at $42.15 in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, while Cisco shares slipped 35 cents to $17.02 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
The deal, which was approved by the boards of both companies and still needs customary approvals, is expected 
to close by late April, in Cisco's fiscal third quarter. 
For Scientific-Atlanta's business of supplying infrastructure to TV providers, Cisco's position as the leading 
provider of network gear will help seal deals as cable, telephone and others build and expand their networks, said 
Jim McDonald, Scientific-Atlanta's chief executive. 
"These customers want more complete integrated solutions from fewer vendors," said McDonald, who said he will 
remain with the company for two years. 
Cisco also will help fuel Scientific Atlanta's expansion beyond cable TV companies that have been relatively 
slow to introduce new technologies to customers, said Josh Bernoff, an analyst at Forrester Research.

Page 144 of 150 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"Cisco has struggled to succeed both with telephone and cable companies. Scientific-Atlanta is sort of in a 
position where innovation and capital push would be helpful for them," he said. "We think this is going to make 
some real changes in the industry." 
Though known to consumers mainly for its cable boxes, Scientific Atlanta also offers the behind-the-scenes 
infrastructure and support to service providers. 
In March, Scientific-Atlanta was awarded a contract to design, build and activate Internet Protocol video 
services for SBC Communications Inc.'s Project Lightspeed fiber-optic network deployment to customers in its 
13-state service area. 
"This acquisition not only brings Cisco access to the intellectual property of a long-standing set-top giant, but it 
now owns the SBC IPTV contract," said Herve Utheza, director of IPTV Research at the Diffusion Group, in a 
note. 
But the company also has a 40 percent share in the U.S. cable box market, second only to Motorola Inc. Cable 
operators are increasingly turning to IP networks to compete with phone companies in the area of high-speed 
Internet access, telephony and video on demand. 
Comcast Corp., the nation's largest cable company, currently works with both companies and will continue to do 
so after the acquisition, said Comcast spokeswoman D'Arcy F. Rudnay. 
"It underscores what's happening in terms of the convergence of entertainment, communications and technology 
platforms," she said. 
Some analysts see it as a potentially risky move for Cisco, which has traditionally acquired small, local and 
privately held companies since its founding in 1984. The closest, in terms of purchase price, was the 1999 
purchase of Cerent Corp., also for $6.9 billion (euro5.91 billion). 
On Friday, Chambers said the deal does fit with the company's belief that if it can't internally develop an emerging 
technology it should either partner with or acquire a leader in the field. 
"Video is way too important ... to do this in a partnership-type of arrangement," he said. 
Cisco said Scientific-Atlanta will become a division of its routing and service provider technology group, led by 
Volpi. 
Cisco said it expects the deal to be neutral to its fiscal 2006 earnings, while slightly boosting its fiscal 2007 profit 
before items. Cisco said it will finance the transaction with cash and debt.

NEW YORK, Nov 18 (AFP) - 
Networking giant Cisco Systems said Friday it agreed to buy cable set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta for 6.9 
billion dollars in a sign of convergence of the telecom and television industries. 
Cisco offered 43 dollars a share for Scientific-Atlanta, a premium over the Thursday close of 41.45. 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple-play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication and online services," said John Chambers, president and chief executive officer 
of Cisco Systems, based in San Jose, California. 
"As consumers demand more sophisticated information and entertainment services in their home, tightly coupled 
applications, devices and networks will be essential. The collective strength of (Cisco's home network division) 
Linksys and Scientific-Atlanta will extend Cisco's leadership position across the entire networked digital home." 
Acquiring Scientific-Atlanta, which sells digital set-top boxes and other gear to the largest US cable operators, 
may help Cisco benefit more from the growth in cable-modem connections and on-demand video services. 
"We believe video is emerging as a key application in the service provider market," Cisco senior vice president 
Mike Volpi said on a conference call. 
Scientific-Atlanta, a company created in 1951, is a major supplier of set-top boxes used by cable providers. 
These systems have become more sophisticated as providers move to digital interactive programs, video on 
demand, high-speed Internet and voice over Internet networks. 
Cisco Systems is the number-one provider of networking systems for the Internet. 
"This deal makes sense as telecom continues to change," said independent telecom analyst Jeff Kagan. 
"As telephone companies and cable TV companies gear up to compete, it's all about the broadband line and all 
the services they can deliver to customers in all the different ways." 
Kagan said Scientific Atlanta "has been a company focused on the cable TV space... but those set-top boxes 
are evolving and getting into phone and Internet and all the other advanced features the companies will need to 
compete with each other." 
Cisco, according to Kagan, "wants a company that can give them a foot in the door to deliver all these services to 
all these customers. Cisco wants to be a leader in TV, telephone and Internet, so this deal makes sense as a 
pre-emptive strike." 
Scientific-Atlanta said the deal gives the company more growth opportunities. 
"We believe that this combination of Cisco and Scientific-Atlanta will benefit our shareholders, our customers 
and our employees," said Jim McDonald, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Scientific-Atlanta. 
"The combined strengths and resources of our two companies will position us to address more quickly the 
growing number of opportunities in the markets we serve and enable us to create new products and services that 
might not have existed otherwise."

NEW YORK, Nov 18 (AFP) - 
Computer network giant Cisco Systems said Friday it reached a deal to buy cable set-top box maker 
Scientific-Atlanta for 6.9 billion dollars in a sign of convergence of the telecom and television industries. 
Cisco offered 43 dollars a share for Scientific-Atlanta, a premium over the Thursday close of 41.45. 
"Video is emerging as the key strategic application in the service provider triple-play bundle of consumer 
entertainment, communication and online services," said John Chambers, president and chief executive officer 
of Cisco Systems. 
"As consumers demand more sophisticated information and entertainment services in their home, tightly coupled 
applications, devices and networks will be essential. The collective strength of (Cisco's home network division) 
Linksys and Scientific-Atlanta will extend Cisco's leadership position across the entire networked digital home." 
Scientific-Atlanta, a company created in 1951, is a major supplier of set-top boxes used by cable providers. 
These systems have become more sophisticated as providers move to digital interactive programs, video on 
demand, high-speed Internet and voice over IP networks. 
Cisco Systems is a top provider of networking systems for the Internet. 
"This deal makes sense as telecom continues to change," said telecom analyst Jeff Kagan. 
"As telephone companies and cable TV companies gear up to compete, it's all about the broadband line and all 
the services they can deliver to customers in all the different ways."
