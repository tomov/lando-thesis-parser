These excerpts are from an exclusive EIG interview with Exxon chairman Lee Raymond and Mobil counterpart 
Lucio Noto on Dec. 2, the day after the merger's announcement. On low oil prices driving mergers: 
Raymond: You recall back in 1986, everybody said that oil prices were going to be low for a long time, too. This 
industry seems to have a view [that it's] "easy glum, easy glow." When things were great, they co uld only get 
greater, and when things were awful, they could only get worse. I don't think the kind of low prices we have now 
are going to persist for a long period of time. But on the other hand, I don't think we're going to see runaway 
prices in the near-term either. I think the facts are that there continues to be pressure in the industry to be among 
the most competitive on a cost basis, to be a top-tier company. That's what Exxon's tried to do. That's what 
Mobil's tried to do. And I'm confident that the new company will be able to do it better than either would have 
done alone. 
On the BP-Mobil downstream venture in Europe: 
Noto: We recognize that this proposed buy-in between Mobil and Exxon does have implications for our existing 
deal with BP in both fuels and lubes, and that we intend to work diligently with both BP and the European 
competition authorities to try to come up with a solution that's a win-win for all the parties involved. We're just at 
the beginning of the beginning of that process. 
On prospects for more oil mergers and acquisitions: 
Raymond: If you stand back and look at a moving timeline over a long period of years, the only thing you can 
conclude is that there will continue to be consolidation. Certainly in the US industry there will be, if simply 
because the amount of oil and gas that's going to be produced in the US - particularly liquids - is going to continue 
to decline. And I think that, with some of the national oil companies becoming more aggressive, they're going to 
for ce consolidation outside the US. 
On size and productivity: 
Noto: You've got to understand that size is not the driver in this. You really need to understand this. If you think 
that size is the driver, then that means that if Shell went out and bought - I don't know - Chevron and ENI 
tomorrow, they would be better than we would be. I think that really misses the issue. We spent a lot of time 
yesterday trying to talk about the discipline of capital management in the long term. Forget about the short-ter m 
benefits. We aren't doing this just to get $2-or $3-billion in cost savings. We certainly embrace that. We want to 
get it. But that's not the motivator here. The motivator goes well beyond that. What I'm afraid of in all this 
commentary is that people are focusing on size and bigness. Raymond: The objective is to be the best at what 
we do. If it turns out that we're also the biggest, that's fine. But if we weren't the biggest, that would be alright, too. 
You ask yourself the following question: Sh ell has a lot more volume than Exxon, so why does Exxon make more 
money?

The pressure for Mobil to agree to some form of alliance has intensified since BP and Amoco announced their 
merger in August (21#12-03)(this issue). But ABN Amro analyst Eugene Nowak comments that, "I thought the big 
question was: Who will Mobil buy, not who will buy Mobil?" Noto admitted that, "We did not run into this 
arrangement. We've looked at acquisitions, mergers of equals" (21#07-02) 
Since the last oil price slump in 1986, Exxon has eschewed growth in the name of higher profits and shareholder 
returns. It's also remained aloof from industry restructuring: Exxon's last corporate acquisition of any weight was 
in 1987, when it bought Celeron. But equity analysts had started to question how Exxon could further improve on 
last year's stron g performance, when return on capital hit 16% (21#11-02). Bankers also note that Exxon's 
shares have performed strongly this year, facilitating an all-stock deal. 
Exxon Mobil officially aims for $2.8-billion in annual pretax savings after three years. This will include $1.15-billion 
in rationalization of overlap and a further $730-million in organizational efficiencies. The rest comprises 
$300-million in exploration cuts, $280-million in sharing best practices, $200-million in procurement savings, and 
$1 40-million in manufacturing and supply synergies. The two companies currently expect to shed around 9,000 
jobs, or about 7% of the total. Analysts reckon the real savings figure will be $3-to $5-billion. 
Exxon has not necessarily abandoned its preference for performance over size. The two majors plan to choose 
the "best projects" from their "large portfolio of investment options." Raymond also commented that Exxon "has a 
strong track record of asset management, including upgrading underperforming assets or divesting if necessary." 
Noto expressed similar views: "Neither Lee [Raymond] nor I have any interest in size. Revenue means nothing to 
me. What counts for me is profits," he said. 
Exxon Mobil will beat Shell on all important financial and operating criteria (see table). And, even taking corporate 
claims with a pinch of salt, there are many areas where the two US majors fit together well. Exxon remains 
heavily dependent on North America, with substantial production in Alaska and Canada, and opportuni ties in the 
deep-water Gulf of Mexico. Mobil relies less on the home region, although it has developed extensive interests 
off Canada's eastern coast. 
Elsewhere, Mobil has important oil production in Nigeria and gas output in Qatar. Exxon lacks significant 
production in either region, but has built a strong exploration portfolio offshore Angola. In Russia, both companies 
are involved in Sakhalin Island oil and gas developments. And in the Caspian, Exxon has significant interests in 
Azerbaijan, whereas Mo bil is strong in Kazakstan and Turkmenistan. 
Natural gas is a core element for both majors, but there's relatively little overlap and a good combination of 
different geographical and operational strengths. While Mobil is a leader in LNG, Exxon has no such interests. 
The downstream sector will attract the closest attention of regulators. In the US, Exxon Mobil will be broadly 
similar in size to the Shell-Texaco downstream alliance, with retail shares of around 13% and 14%, respectively. 
Exxon Mobil may have to sell retail outlets in the Northeast, and possibly a refinery on the Gulf Coast. 
The picture in Europe is complicated by Mobil's existing downstream alliance with BP. Analysts suggest the most 
likely outcome is for BP to acquire Mobil's minority 30% stake in the refining and marketing side of the business. 
They are less certain about lubricants, where Mobil is the majority partner. 
In Asia, Exxon has refining capacity of around 650,000 barrels a day against Mobil's 660,000 b/d. This will crea te 
a regional force on par with Shell and Caltex. It will be particularly strong in Japan, a prime candidate for 
rationalization.

It's huge beyond belief: This month's merger of Exxon and Mobil will create a true giant of the oil industry, 
standing head and shoulders above the closest rival, Royal Dutch/Shell. The deal also dwarfs the merger of 
British Petroleum and Amoco, previously the hottest play in oil industry consolidation. But how does this sheer 
size square with Exxon's traditional resi stance to acquisitions and asset growth? Reading between the lines, it 
seems that the US giant continues to attach as much - if not more - importance to earnings improvement (see 
adjacent story). 
There's no doubt about who's the dominant partner. The merged company - due to be formed by mid-1999 - will 
be called Exxon Mobil, and will retain both companies' brands. But Exxon chief Lee Raymond scoops up three 
top titles - chairman, chief executive officer, and president - and doesn't plan to retire u ntil 2004. Mobil's Lucio 
Noto is relegated to vice chairman. Exxon will own 70% of the new company and will dominate its board, with 13 
of 19 representatives. Mobil gets only six seats: Two for acting officials - Noto and Eugene Renna, demoted from 
president and chief operating officer to senior vice president in the new company - and four for appointed 
nonemployee directors. 
The headquarters will be at Exxon's home of Irving, Texas, although worldwide downstream operations will be 
handled out of Mobil's site in Fairfax, Virginia. Global upstream and chemicals will be run out of Houston, marking 
further Exxon bias. But Mobil's shareholders will be rewarded handsomely for their surrender: The Dec. 1 deal 
gave Mobil shares a premium of nearly one-third on their value before merger rumors started a week previously, 
and of 15% to the close of Nov. 30. 
In a joint statement, Raymond and Noto said the move will "significantly enhance shareholder value," with 
combined assets allowing "a higher return on capital employed than either company could achieve on a 
stand-alone basis." The statement also said the two majors "share common values, have compatible strategies, 
and demonstrated track records of achievement." Both have indeed been champions of this decade's quest for 
shareholder value. But they've pursued goals in very different ways, with Exxon's bureaucratic approach 
contrasting with the idiosyncratic style of Mobil under Noto. 
Despite his forceful personality, Noto has already shown that he can make comp romises in the interests of 
shareholders: The company's European downstream alliance with BP involved the sacrifice of Mobil's gasoline 
brand. "We tend to do the right thing when times are tough, and they are tough now," Noto said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil majors will stampede for new trophy deals in old Middle East haunts in 1999 while 
pursuing a merger spree back home to cut costs and raise market share. 
Battling low prices and weak demand, Big Oil's herd instinct will drive companies into each others' arms and fire a 
parallel race for the world's cheapest and biggest reserves in the Gulf. 
Both trends gathered pace in a redrawing of the world's energy map in 1998, spurred by a disastrous 40 percent 
price crash born of Asian economic collapse and rising Iraqi exports. 
As the century closes, hungry corporate cannibals will dine again on Wall Street for more mega-merger 
economies of scale. 
"We think that there is more consolidation to come - alliances, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions," said Jay 
Wilson of bankers J.P. Morgan. 
Prospects for an early oil price recovery are remote with a stubborn stock overhang and rescue efforts mired in 
bickering inside producer club OPEC. 
GOLIATHS OFFER BETTER FINANCING, TECHNOLOGY, REACH 
Sweeping budget cuts forced on oil firms by the price rout will take a good two years to provide big falls in crude 
supply - too late to save weaker explorers and even some large integrated companies. 
A Reuters poll of experts projects an average price for benchmark Brent crude of just $13.50 a barrel in 1999, 
unchanged from this year after a 30 percent slide. 
"The only thing you can conclude is that there is going to be more consolidation," said Exxon chairman Lee 
Raymond. 
The Texas-based firm is merging with Mobil to form the world's largest company by revenue, reuniting the largest 
successors from the 1911 breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. 
The $240 billion giant will dwarf a proposed $110 billion British Petroleum and Amoco combination created to nip 
the heels of the larger Royal Dutch/Shell. 
Already earning pre-merger incomes greater than those of many countries where they operate, such new goliaths 
will have the muscle to grab the lion's share of the best upstream prospects and widen downstream access to the 
consumer. 
Such titans don't want only multi-billion dollar savings. 
They target more leverage from new technology by spreading it over a wider base, improving returns on capital to 
shore up a must-have status with institutional investors. 
They also want sheer size to attract Middle East countries seeking capital from foreign partners to expand their 
reserves, the world's most plentiful and the cheapest to extract.

Rod Peacock of J.P. Morgan, a banker involved in Exxon and BP's respective mergers, says oil super-giants offer 
Gulf states unrivalled technology, financial strength and global reach. 
GULF REOPENING PRESSURES SAUDI, MEXICO TO FOLLOW SUIT 
And mergers may simplify the Gulf states' choice. 
"Being big wins you a seat at the table. It means people pay attention to you," said Bob Maguire, a managing 
director at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter . 
That seems to be the case in Kuwait, seeking to boost its output capacity in an undeclared race for foreign capital 
with other Gulf states as well as Venezuela, Nigeria and the Caspian. 
"I think it made our life much easier," said Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Sabah. 
"Instead of negotiating with BP and Amoco separately, we have both of them in one. Instead of Exxon and Mobil, 
we have them both in one." 
The Gulf reopening signals the return next century of Middle East OPEC powers to their former position at the 
heart of the global oil industry after 20 years as nationalised backwaters. 
Dusting cobwebs from some of the oldest oil relationships, the reopening also pressures state giants Saudi 
Arabia and Mexico to join the investment race or risk losing out. 
It also means that the upside-down world of international oil exploration, where the bulk of development has 
occurred in costly areas like the North Sea, will see a return to commercial normality as investment shifts to the 
Gulf's low-risk fields. 
"I suspect that by 2005, 2010, we will see the normal laws of economics reasserting themselves, with the volume 
increases going to the low-cost producers," Royal Dutch/Shell chairman Mark Moody-Stuart told Petroleum 
Intelligence Weekly. 
"And if that happens it almost certainly means lower oil prices," said Moody-Stuart, whose company is the latest 
to confirm talks on possible post-sanctions projects with Iraq. 
Maguire says being huge gives companies the financial clout to make a big bet on a sole risk basis upstream 
rather than settling for the syndicated returns earned by smaller rivals. 
MEGA-MAJORS COULD SHRUG OFF TAKEOVER PRESSURE 
A possible additional motive for OPEC states inviting in foreign capital is to divert that money away from 
non-OPEC areas that are the source of competing production, he said. 
"For that reason, you'd rather bring in the guy who's spending a lot rather than spending a little," Maguire said. 
Not every investor hails the creation of super-giants. 
Keith Palmer, a vice chairman of investment banking at N.M. Rosthchild, sees doubts about whether a company 
capitalised at more than $50 billion needs to become bigger to be more efficient. 
"Should we welcome or encourage the creation of mega-companies which are relatively immune from capital 
market pressures - i.e. they are takeover proof?" 
But for smaller pure exploration firms that lack downstream earnings and for whom debt and equity financing is 
increasingly difficult and costly, mergers or takeovers look inevitable. 
And with the international industry's geographical centre of gravity returning to the home of cheap oil, industry 
watchers recall oil tycoon J. Paul Getty's mid-century declaration: 
"If one is to be anybody in the oil business, one must have a footing in the Middle East."

The Gulf reopening signals the return next century of Middle East OPEC powers to their former position at the 
heart of the global oil industry after 20 years as nationalised backwaters. 
Dusting cobwebs from some of the oldest oil relationships, the reopening also pressures state giants Saudi 
Arabia and Mexico to join the investment race or risk losing out. 
It also means that the upside-down world of international oil exploration, where the bulk of development has 
occurred in costly areas like the North Sea, will see a return to commercial normality as investment shifts to the 
Gulf's low-risk fields. 
"I suspect that by 2005, 2010, we will see the normal laws of economics reasserting themselves, with the volume 
increases going to the low-cost producers," Royal Dutch/Shell chairman Mark Moody-Stuart told Petroleum 
Intelligence Weekly. 
"And if that happens it almost certainly means lower oil prices," said Moody-Stuart, whose company is the latest 
to confirm talks on possible post-sanctions projects with Iraq. 
Maguire says being huge gives companies the financial clout to make a big bet on a sole risk basis upstream 
rather than settling for the syndicated returns earned by smaller rivals. 
MEGA-MAJORS COULD SHRUG OFF TAKEOVER PRESSURE 
A possible additional motive for OPEC states inviting in foreign capital is to divert that money away from 
non-OPEC areas that are the source of competing production, he said. 
"For that reason, you'd rather bring in the guy who's spending a lot rather than spending a little," Maguire said. 
Not every investor hails the creation of super-giants. 
Keith Palmer, a vice chairman of investment banking at N.M. Rosthchild, sees doubts about whether a company 
capitalised at more than $50 billion needs to become bigger to be more efficient. 
"Should we welcome or encourage the creation of mega-companies which are relatively immune from capital 
market pressures - i.e. they are takeover proof?" 
But for smaller pure exploration firms that lack downstream earnings and for whom debt and equity financing is 
increasingly difficult and costly, mergers or takeovers look inevitable. 
And with the international industry's geographical centre of gravity returning to the home of cheap oil, industry 
watchers recall oil tycoon J. Paul Getty's mid-century declaration: 
"If one is to be anybody in the oil business, one must have a footing in the Middle East."

YEAREND - Big Oil's cannibals hungry for more. 
YEAREND - Big Oil's cannibals hungry for more.

LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Oil majors will stampede for new trophy deals in old Middle East haunts in 1999 
while pursuing a merger spree back home to cut costs and raise market share. 
Battling low prices and weak demand, Big Oil's herd instinct will drive companies into each others' arms and fire a 
parallel race for the world's cheapest and biggest reserves in the Gulf. 
Both trends gathered pace in a redrawing of the world's energy map in 1998, spurred by a disastrous 40 percent 
price crash born of Asian economic collapse and rising Iraqi exports. 
As the century closes, hungry corporate cannibals will dine again on Wall Street for more mega-merger 
economies of scale. 
"We think that there is more consolidation to come - alliances, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions," said Jay 
Wilson of bankers J.P. Morgan. 
Prospects for an early oil price recovery are remote with a stubborn stock overhang and rescue efforts mired in 
bickering inside producer club OPEC. 
GOLIATHS OFFER BETTER FINANCING, TECHNOLOGY, REACH 
Sweeping budget cuts forced on oil firms by the price rout will take a good two years to provide big falls in crude 
supply - too late to save weaker explorers and even some large integrated companies. 
A Reuters poll of experts projects an average price for benchmark Brent crude of just $13.50 a barrel in 1999, 
unchanged from this year after a 30 percent slide. 
"The only thing you can conclude is that there is going to be more consolidation," said Exxon chairman Lee 
Raymond. 
The Texas-based firm is merging with Mobil to form the world's largest company by revenue, reuniting the largest 
successors from the 1911 breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. 
The $240 billion giant will dwarf a proposed $110 billion British Petroleum and Amoco combination created to nip 
the heels of the larger Royal Dutch/Shell. 
Already earning pre-merger incomes greater than those of many countries where they operate, such new goliaths 
will have the muscle to grab the lion's share of the best upstream prospects and widen downstream access to the 
consumer. 
Such titans don't want only multi-billion dollar savings. 
They target more leverage from new technology by spreading it over a wider base, improving returns on capital to 
shore up a must-have status with institutional investors. 
They also want sheer size to attract Middle East countries seeking capital from foreign partners to expand their 
reserves, the world's most plentiful and the cheapest to extract.

Rod Peacock of J.P. Morgan, a banker involved in Exxon and BP's respective mergers, says oil super-giants offer 
Gulf states unrivalled technology, financial strength and global reach. 
GULF REOPENING PRESSURES SAUDI, MEXICO TO FOLLOW SUIT 
And mergers may simplify the Gulf states' choice. 
"Being big wins you a seat at the table. It means people pay attention to you," said Bob Maguire, a managing 
director at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter . 
That seems to be the case in Kuwait, seeking to boost its output capacity in an undeclared race for foreign capital 
with other Gulf states as well as Venezuela, Nigeria and the Caspian. 
"I think it made our life much easier," said Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Sabah. 
"Instead of negotiating with BP and Amoco separately, we have both of them in one. Instead of Exxon and Mobil, 
we have them both in one." 
The Gulf reopening signals the return next century of Middle East OPEC powers to their former position at the 
heart of the global oil industry after 20 years as nationalised backwaters. 
Dusting cobwebs from some of the oldest oil relationships, the reopening also pressures state giants Saudi

If the merger of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. goes through without divestments, the combination will create a 
giant in one basic petrochemical segment after another. 
Neither company is a notable manufacturer of plastic and textile end products, but they are big separately and 
would be huge together when it comes to the basic olefin and aromatic building blocks and some of the 
derivatives. 
Worldwide, Exxon Mobil Corp. would be the top maker of ethylene, the most fundamental of petrochemicals. The 
company's ownership stakes in ethylene crackers would give it an annual global production capacity of almost 6 
million metric tons, said Mark Eramo, director of world light olefins at consulting company Chemical Market 
Associates Inc. (CMAI). 
Among ethylene makers, it would be trailed by Dow Chemical Co. at 5.4 million tons, Equistar Chemicals L.P. at 
5.1 million, Royal Dutch/Shell Group at 4.8 million and Union Carbide Corp. at 2.6 million. 
If the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) insists on divestments to prevent control of markets, the agency will focus 
on U.S. markets separately, where Exxon Mobil will be second to the Equistar joint venture as an ethylene 
producer. 
But in some chemicals, the Exxon Mobil percentages could make buyers uneasy, and through them the FTC. 
"The size is such that there may be some problems with the Federal Trade Commission," said analyst Rob 
Harvan at consulting company Bonner & Moore Associates Inc. "I'm going to be surprised if this sails through the 
FTC, and this is only the chemical side." 
Exxon Chairman Lee Raymond has said that he, too, would be surprised if the FTC did not insist on some asset 
sell-offs (TOD, 12-2-98, p.1). 
As Harvan tallied it, Exxon Mobil would have U.S. market shares - measured by percentages of U.S. production 
capacities - of 14% for ethylene, almost 13% for propylene, almost 16% for butadiene, 20% for paraxylene and 
29% for benzene. 
And among derivatives, he estimated Exxon Mobil would have U.S. production shares of 14% for low-density 
polyethylene, 18% for high-density polyethylene and 23% for linear low-density polyethylene. 
Divestments of petrochemical plants do not necessarily come easily, partly because integration with operations 
farther downstream can make it difficult to spin off a plant as a stand-alone entity. 
Harvan said Exxon and Mobil might actually want to consider spinning off a large part of their chemicals into a 
joint venture - something possibly parallel to what Lyondell Petrochemical Co., Millennium Chemicals Inc. and 
Occidental Petroleum Corp. did in putting Equistar together.

Exxon and Mobil have shown that lust for size, encouraged by falling oil prices, can override a lack of genuine 
love and cultural compatibility among marriage partners in the rapidly consolidating oil industry. 
To universal surprise in Wall Street, Exxon said it would pay as much as $82 billion - a 32% premium - for Mobil 
as the two US groups united to form the world's biggest energy company. It is certainly easy to be overawed by 
the new powerhouse: it has a market cap of $250 billion and will employ 120,000 people. Indeed, all the figures 
involved are enormous: even the break-up fee - should the deal not close - is set at a cool $1.5 billion. And the 
sums payable to the most senior executives - rumoured to be around #50 million - are not unimpressive either 
and no doubt helped to quell any dissent amongst them. 
Yet the affinities between the companies are far from obvious. While Mobil is well-known as a dynamic, 
cost-cutting innovator, but the much larger Exxon has been something of a ponderous giant and could end up 
extinguishing the creative fire of its new acquisition. Lee Raymond, chairman and chief executive of Exxon, will 
hold the reins of the new entity as chairman, chief executive, and president. The differences have been especially 
evident in the important Caspian region where Exxon has looked off the pace but where Mobil has cut a 
formidable figure. 
The markets' scepticism about the deal was reflected in share price falls for both companies on the day of the 
announcement. Investors are concerned partly about oil prices, but they are also aware that the deal has looked 
all the more hubristic since the regulatory authorities started shown an ominous degree of interest in the tie-up. 
Concerns are growing that there will soon be too little competition in this sector. There is pressure on the Federal 
Trade Commission to look at the two big mergers in the oil industry - this deal plus the BP-Amoco combination - 
together. The chairman of the US Senate's antitrust committee, the Republican Mike DeWine, said: "it is 
worrisome. 
I think they [the FTC] have to factor this proposed merger of Exxon and Mobil into their considerations of 
Amoco... they have to look at the big picture."At the very least, the new company will have to shed a large number 
of its retail stations, in both the Europe and the US. Tougher action remains a possibility, especially given that the 
spate of oil mergers and acquisitions has shown no sign of abating. 
Exxon and Mobil argued in their joint statement that the new business would benefit from its wide and 
complementary geographical coverage. "Mobil and Exxon's respective strengths in West Africa, the Caspian 
region, Russia, South America, and North America, line up well, with minimal overlap." They also said that, on a 
"near-time basis", cost savings would amount to $2.8 billion.

this must be the biggest ever week for industry deal announcements. the formation of Exxon Mobil, Total Fina, 
and Sanofi-Synthelabo, along with Hoechst's and Rhone-Poulenc's creation of Aventis, and the Viag- Alusuisse 
Lonza tie-up, drive change across the breadth of the chemical industry, from upstream petrochemicals through to 
fine chemicals. 
The Exxon Mobil and Total Fina deals are the more striking for being unexpected. It is not that plenty more 
change is any surprise in the sector after a year that has seen the launch of BP-Amoco, OxyChem's joining 
Equistar, and Lyondell's swallowing of Arco Chemical. It is just that the change was not expected from this 
quarter; better odds were on moves by players like Union Carbide, Nova Chemicals, or Shell. 
There's a certain irony in the fact that the biggest petrochemicals deal ever that creates the new leader in the 
sector was not driven by petrochemical considerations. At his press conference in New York, Lee Raymond, 
Exxon Mobil chairman-to-be, listed a more complete worldwide portfolio of petrochemical operations as one of 
the benefits in the takeover, but it would be silly to pretend chemicals weighed decisively in a deal inspired by the 
need for cost savings in a low oil-price environment. Even with $17.5 billion in sales, petrochemicals will represent 
less than 10% of Exxon Mobil's total revenues. In the Total- PetroFina deal, the marginal position of chemicals is 
even more pronounced. That Total-which has built an attractive $5-billion/year specialty chemicals portfolio and 
kept its commodity exposure to a minimum-will be taking on PetroFina's $3-billion/year petrochemicals business 
has been a key reason for analysts' criticism of Total's move. 
That said, in the case of Exxon Mobil, the progeny is a very formidable petrochemicals player and clear number 
one worldwide with a strong profits record to match. Ranking number one in North American aromatics and 
number two in olefins, Exxon Mobil will also have a key position in Saudi Arabia, the preeminent low-cost 
production location. Its ethylene capacity there will total 1.5 million m.t./year when the new Yanpet and Kemya 
crackers start up in 2000. The Singapore properties will come under single ownership, as will Australian 
petrochemicals maker Kemcor. Mobil's project at Jose, Venezuela also promises good economics. 
Although it has been rumored for two months, the Hoechst and Rhone- Poulenc tryst is none the less 
momentous. Momentous for winding up the long histories of the two firms, momentous for being the first really big 
European cross-border life sciences tie-up, and momentous for its size in spite of the two companies' obvious 
weaknesses. Aventis should rank as the world's number one pesticides maker-and one with a serious stake in 
agricultural biotech-as well as the number two prescription drugs maker. There is also going to be a monumental 
amount of fallout. Hoechst's holdings of 50% in Wacker-Chemie, DyStar, and Targor; 66.6% in Messer 
Griesheim; and 24.3% in the new Clariant are now glaringly superfluous to Aventis Hoechst's life sciences-bound 
future. Rhone- Poulenc, meanwhile, has its 68% stake in Rhodia to sell off. 
We can also expect substantial disposals of pharmaceutical chemicals capacity as Aventis rationalizes its 
operations. That is a likely consequence of the Sanofi-Synthelabo merger too, as is a review of Sanofi Chimie and 
Synthelabo's Finorga fine chemicals subsidiary. The consequences of Viag merging with Alusuisse Lonza are 
harder to read at this point, with the logic of the deal once again far from the chemical activities of the partners. 
But it is a safe bet to expect a pruning of the new company's DM10-billion($6 billion)/year chemicals portfolio, 
which now ranges from construction chemicals through unsaturated polyester resins to pharmaceutical 
intermediates.

It was hardly a surprise, but it is actually happening: The world's biggest-ever merger, creating a true giant of the 
oil industry. Today's confirmation that Exxon and Mobil are merging ended almost a week of speculation, as 
details of the talks trickled out. The new Exxon Mobil Corp. effectively an Exxon takeover of the United States' 
second-biggest oil company for roughly $80-billion will have market capitalization of around $240-billion at current 
prices, setting it head and shoulders above closest rival Royal Dutch/Shell. The deal also dwarfs the merger of 
BP Amoco, previously the hottest play in oil industry consolidation. The takeover still causes some surprise, given 
Exxon's traditional resistance both to acquisitions and to asset growth. But reading between the lines, it's clear 
that Exxon is pursuing continued earnings improvement as much as and perhaps more than size. 
Viewed alongside the $38.8-million merger of Belgian Petrofina into French Total that was also confirmed today, 
the deal amply demonstrates that most of the private Western oil industry is now effectively "in play." 
There's no doubt about which company dominates the new combo. The merged company, which is due to be 
formed by mid-1999, is to be called Exxon Mobil and will retain both companies' brands. But Exxon chief Lee 
Raymond scoops up three top titles chairman, chief executive officer, and president and does not plan to retire 
until 2004. Mobil's Lucio Noto is relegated to vice chairman.

Exxon is also to dominate its board, with 13 of 19 representatives. Mobil gets only six seats, with two for acting 
officials Noto and Eugene Renna, who was demoted from president and chief operating officer to senior vice 
president in the new company and four for appointed non-employee directors. 
The headquarters is to be at Exxon's home of Irving, Texas, with worldwide downstream operations handled out 
of Mobil's Fairfax, Virginia, site. Global upstream and chemicals is to be run out of Houston, marking further 
Exxon bias. 
But Mobil's shareholders have been rewarded handsomely for their surrender: The transaction gives them 
1.32015 shares of Exxon for each Mobil share, valuing the latter at $99 at the time of the deal's announcement.

This represents a near one-third premium to the value of Mobil shares before merger rumors started to proliferate 
a week ago, and of 15% to the closing price of Nov. 30. Both companies' shares ended the day slightly down. 
Mobil's stock closed down 2.6% at $84 3/4. Exxon's shares were 4.5% down at $71 5/8. 
Exxon Mobil is being organized on functional lines. Renna is to head the downstream, with upstream and 
chemicals led by Exxon's Harry Longwell and Rene Dahan, respectively. In a joint statement, Raymond and Noto 
emphasized that the two majors "share common values, have compatible strategies, and demonstrated track 
records of achievement." Both have indeed been champions of this decade's quest for shareholder value. But 
they have pursued goals in very different ways. Exxon's conservative and bureaucratic approach contrasts with 
the idiosyncratic style of Mobil under Noto. Raymond dominated today's press conference on the merger, in an 
abrasive manner. 
Culture clashes are widely regarded as one of the greatest obstacles to a successful corporate combination. 
Raymond conceded that "assimilating two cultures is not easy." But the problem has been eased, if not resolved, 
by the submissive role of Mobil and its senior officials. Despite his forceful personality, Noto has already shown 
that he can make compromises in the interests of shareholders: The company's European downstream alliance 
with British Petroleum involved the sacrifice of Mobil's gasoline brand. "We tend to do the right thing when times 
are tough, and they are tough now," Noto told today's press conference. 
The pressure for Mobil to agree some form of alliance has intensified since August, when BP and Amoco 
announced their targeted year-end merger. Mobil had discussed merger plans with both companies, and more 
recently had negotiations with Arco, Chevron, and others. Mobil is no stranger to corporate deals, from its 
purchase of Superior Oil in the 1980s to the more recent acquisition of Australia's Ampolex. 
The deal seems unusual for Exxon. Since the last oil price slump in 1986, the US giant has eschewed growth in 
the name of higher profitability and shareholder returns. It has also remained largely aloof from industry 
restructuring. Exxon's last corporate acquisition of any weight was in 1987, when it bought Celeron. 
But equity analysts had started to question how Exxon could further improve on last year's strong performance, 
when return on capital hit 16%. Such concerns may well diminish as Exxon sinks its teeth into Mobil. Exxon's 
strong share price performance this year also facilitated an all-stock deal. Raymond said the merger is not being 
driven by short-term oil prices, and would still have taken place at $20 a barrel. 
Exxon Mobil officially aims to bring $2.8-billion in annual pretax "synergies" cost cuts or enhancements to 
revenue after three years. At least one-third of the total is supposed to come from rationalization of overlapping 
businesses and a further chunk from "organizational efficiencies." The two companies currently expect to shed 
around 9,000 jobs, or around 7% of the total. 
Analysts reckon that the real savings figure may well be higher, at $3-to $5-billion. By way of comparison, BP 
Amoco is targeting $2-billion in annual savings. Indeed, Exxon has not necessarily abandoned its preference for 
performance over size. Raymond commented: "I have never been in favor of bigness for bigness's sake. But this 
is a case of the whole thing being greater than the sum of its parts." Noto expressed similar views: "Neither Lee 
[Raymond] nor I have any interest in size. Revenue means nothing to me. What counts for me is profits." 
The two companies also repeated the argument of BP Amoco that size and access go hand in hand. "Our 
combined strengths make us the partner of choice for most governments," Raymond said. 
Exxon Mobil will beat Shell on all important financial and operating criteria (see top table). Based on end-1997 
figures, it will have upstream production of 4.5-million barrels oil equivalent per day and reserves of 21-billion boe, 
against Shell's 3.7-million boe/d and 19-billion barrels. Exxon remains heavily dependent on North America, with 
substantial production in Alaska and Canada and opportunities in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico. Mobil relies less 
on the home region, although it has extensive interests off Canada's east coast, starting with the Hibernia oil field 
development. 
Elsewhere, Mobil has important oil production in Nigeria in West Africa and gas output in Qatar. Exxon lacks 
significant production in either region, but has built a strong exploration portfolio off Angola. In Russia, both are 
involved in Sakhalin oil and gas developments in the Far East. And in the Caspian, Exxon has significant interests 
in Azerbaijan, whereas Mobil is strong in Kazakstan and Turkmenistan. 
Exxon has few upstream projects in Latin America, but is a major player downstream. Mobil is more involved in 
the region's exploration and production, with operations in Argentina, Peru, and Venezuela, and Brazilian deals in 
the works. Mobil had begun to develop downstream businesses there, selling branded products in Argentina and 
Venezuela and owning part of Peru's La Pampilla refinery.

Natural gas is a core element for both majors, but there's relatively little overlap and a good mix of strengths. 
Exxon is the world's third-largest gas producer, behind Gazprom and Shell. Both Exxon and Mobil produce 
one-third of their worldwide gas in North America, where Exxon sells its output directly and Mobil's is sold through 
Duke Energy. 
Roles are reversed outside North America. Almost half Exxon's gas is produced in Europe in a Dutch partnership 
with Shell, NAM, that represents one of its biggest profit centers. Exxon then sells its output through Gasunie, in 
which it owns 25%. In the UK, too, most Exxon gas is produced through a co-venture with Shell, and Exxon sold 
its marketing assets to the Anglo-Dutch major last year. Mobil, by contrast, seemed set to become a leading 
challenger of the Shell-Exxon duo in the European market. 
Indonesia is the heart of Mobil's overseas gas empire, centering on the 12-million ton/yr Arun LNG facility. But 
there are doubts about Mobil's long-term ability to provide reserves for this project, with Total playing an 
increasing role. In Qatar, Mobil's Qatargas LNG scheme came on stream last year, and it is now turning to the 
second, Rasgas, LNG development. Mobil has been studying LNG regasification terminals in Turkey, Italy, and 
India. 
Exxon has no existing LNG interests. It has important gas assets in Asia, notably in Malaysia, but has pursued 
mainly pipeline options. The company has also started developing gas-to-liquids projects. 
The downstream sector is likely to attract the closest attention from regulators. In the US, Exxon Mobil will be 
broadly similar in size to the Shell-Texaco-Aramco downstream alliance, with retail shares of around 13% and 
14% respectively. Exxon Mobil may have to sell retail outlets in the Northeast, where it would have 8,700 
stations. Regulators may also consider forcing the new company to sell a refinery on the Gulf Coast, although this 
is by no means certain. Exxon Mobil would have 1.33-million barrels a day of gross capacity on the Gulf Coast, 
out of a total 17.8-million b/d in the region. Exxon Mobil will have total US capacity of 1.85-million b/d. 
Exxon and Mobil officials met with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) this afternoon. At today's press 
conference, Raymond noted: "We would be absolutely amazed though pleasantly surprised if the FTC didn't say 
we have to rationalize some assets." Analysts do not expect regulators to attempt to block the merger, however, 
given that the Shell-Texaco deal has already been approved. 
The picture in Europe is complicated by Mobil's existing downstream alliance with BP. Several developments are 
possible: The joint venture could be unraveled, with BP buying out Mobil; Exxon could simply take control of 
Mobil's share in the business; or Exxon Mobil could buy BP out. The most likely outcome is for BP to acquire 
Mobil's minority 30% stake in the refining and marketing side of the business. BP almost certainly won't want to 
pull out of the European downstream. Unraveling the successful venture would be extremely complicated and 
would probably be opposed by BP. And BP is likely to find the idea of Exxon taking over Mobil's stake 
unpalatable, given Exxon's other interests in the region. 
Such a move would, in any case, increase Exxon Mobil's problems in securing regulatory approval. Exxon 
controls around 10% of the European retail market by volume, against BP-Mobil's 8%, according to consultants 
MarketLine. But this varies from country to country. Pockets of concentration exist in the UK, Austria, and the 
Netherlands. Prospects are less clear for lubricants, where Mobil is the majority partner with 51% in the venture 
with BP. 
In Asia, Exxon has refining capacity of around 650,000 b/d against Mobil's 575,000 b/d. This would create a 
regional force on par with Shell and Caltex. It would be particularly strong in Japan, where Exxon has capacity of 
210,000 b/d and Mobil 260,000 b/d. With the Japanese oil industry starting to restructure, Exxon Mobil is almost 
certain to rationalize its assets there. 
Exxon Mobil will be a world leader in petrochemicals, dominating olefins, polyethylene, polypropylene, and 
paraxylene.

The surge in Western stock markets back toward record highs has encouraged mergers and acquisitions, as 
companies can again back deals with highly valued stock instead of cash. With Total also taking over Petrofina, 
speculation is frantic about what company will be next. Shell's intentions are arousing some of the greatest 
interest: This major proudly opted for growth over shareholder value, but saw its popularity suffer as oil prices 
slumped. Shell now faces the unpleasant prospect of being overshadowed by Exxon Mobil, as BP Amoco snaps 
at its heels. 
Insiders admit that Shell has eyed both Total and Petrofina with interest in the past. But until now, it has preferred 
a strategy of regional alliances, such as US or Australian downstream mergers, although a proposed European 
venture with Texaco has just collapsed. Two factors weighing against a merger: Shell is still struggling to put its 
own house in order, and its shares have performed poorly compared with Exxon's this year, making an all-stock 
deal harder to conclude. 
Other leading candidates for mergers or acquisitions include Chevron, Texaco, and Arco in the US, as well as Elf 
Aquitaine, ENI, and Repsol in Europe. US independent refiners are also seen as ripe either for the picking or for 
picking up assets that the majors are forced to shed by regulators. Independent producers in the UK and US 
could be potential takeover targets in some cases, although it appears that buying interest is weak in those 
companies focused on mature plays in the onshore US or UK North Sea.

"Exxon Mobil" doesn't exactly role off the tongue. But then neither does "BP Amoco" or "Total Fina." None is 
likely to achieve the generic identification with gasoline that Kleenex has with tissues or Hoover with vacuum 
cleaners. But not for wont of size. What Exxon has done with what amounts to an $80-billion takeover of Mobil in 
the name-numbing guise of a merger is to up the stakes yet again in the increasingly frenzied game of oil industry 
consolidation. If all goes as Exxon Chairman Lee Raymond plans, it may also lower the target for operating costs 
and set a higher industry standard for return on capital. The new Exxon Mobil will have market capitalization of 
around $240-billion at current prices, placing it far above the closest rival Royal Dutch/Shell. The deal also dwarfs 
the BP Amoco merger (37#34-04). 
Despite several days of advance warning via press leaks, it still comes as something of a surprise that the merger 
was actually agreed upon, given Exxon's traditional resistance both to acquisitions and to asset inflation not to 
mention Mobil's idiosyncratic, but effective, management style. However, it's clear that Exxon is still pursuing 
continued earnings improvement, rather than size for size's sake. And it's unclear that Mobil had a great deal of 
choice in the matter. 
There's no doubt about which side will be in charge at Exxon Mobil. The merged company, due to be formed by 
mid-1999, is to retain both brands. But Exxon's Raymond scoops up three top titles chairman, chief executive 
officer, and president and does not plan to retire until 2004. Mobil Chairman Lucio Noto is relegated to vice 
chairman. If all goes to plan, Exxon shareholders will own 70% of the new company and its executives will 
dominate the board, with 13 of 19 members. Mobil gets only six seats, with two for acting officials Noto and 
Eugene Renna and four for non-employee directors. Renna is being demoted from president and chief operating 
officer to senior vice president in the new company. The headquarters will be at Exxon's home of Irving, Texas. 
Worldwide downstream operations are to be handled from Mobil's site in Fairfax, Virginia, with global upstream 
and chemicals run from Exxon's Houston site. 
Mobil's shareholders have been rewarded handsomely for the surrender of their company: The transaction gives 
them 1.32015 shares of Exxon for each Mobil share, valuing the latter at $99 at the time of the deal's 
announcement. This represents a near one-third premium to the value of Mobil shares before the merger rumors 
started a week ago, and of 15% to the closing price of Nov. 30. 
Exxon Mobil is being organized along functional lines. Renna will head the downstream, with upstream and 
chemicals led by Exxon men Harry Longwell and Rene Dahan, respectively. In a joint statement, Raymond and 
Noto emphasized that the two majors "share common values, have compatible strategies, and demonstrated 
track records of achievement." Both have, indeed, been champions of this decade's quest for shareholder value. 
But they have pursued goals in very different ways, with Exxon's conservative and bureaucratic approach 
contrasting with Mobil's flamboyant and highly personalized style, under Noto and his predecessors. 
Culture clashes are widely regarded as one of the greatest obstacles to a successful corporate combination, 
especially in "mergers of equals" with shared responsibilities at the top. Raymond admitted that "assimilating two 
cultures is not easy." But the problem has been eased, if not resolved, by the submissive role of Mobil and its 
senior officials. Noto has shown that he can make compromises in the interests of shareholders: Mobil's 
European downstream alliance with BP involved the sacrifice of Mobil's gasoline brand. "We tend to do the right 
thing when times are tough, and they are tough now," Noto said last week. 
The pressure for Mobil to agree to some form of alliance has intensified since British Petroleum and Amoco 
announced their merger in August. Mobil had discussed mergers with both companies, and more recently 
negotiated with Arco, Chevron, and others. Mobil is no stranger to corporate deals, from its purchase of Superior 
Oil in the 1980s to the more recent acquisition of Australia's Ampolex. Noto insists: "We did not run into this 
arrangement. We've looked at acquisitions, mergers of equals." 
The deal seems unusual for Exxon. Since the last oil price slump in 1986, the US giant has eschewed growth in 
the name of higher profits and shareholder returns. It has also remained largely aloof from industry consolidation.

But equity analysts had started to question how Exxon could further improve on last year's strong performance 
concerns that will probably disappear as Exxon sinks its teeth into Mobil (see Super Major story). Exxon Mobil 
officially aims to bring $2.8-billion in annual pretax "synergies" code for cost cuts or enhancements to revenue 
within three years. At least one-third of the total is slated to come from rationalization of overlapping businesses 
and a further chunk from "organizational efficiencies." The two companies plan to shed around 9,000 jobs, or 
some 7% of the total. Analysts reckon that the real savings figure will be $3-to $5-billion. 
The two companies' joint statement also said that the merger "allows us to manage our expanded, combined 
asset base to deliver increasing returns and growth to our shareholders while reducing our operating costs." 
Exxon insists that this does not mark any change in its preference for performance over size. The aim is to select 
the "best projects" from the two companies' "large portfolio" of investment options. Raymond is characteristically 
blunt on the matter: "The objective is to be the best at what we do. If it turns out that we're also the biggest, that's 
fine. But if we weren't the biggest, that would be alright, too." Pursuing the notion that biggest isn't always best, he 
continues: "You ask yourself the following question: Shell has a lot more volume than Exxon, so why does Exxon 
make more money?"(see Raymond/Noto interview). 
As the only US super major so far at least Exxon Mobil seems destined to be a favorite in the contest for 
proposed upstream openings in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. And the two companies repeat the argument made by 
BP Amoco that size and access go hand in hand. "Our combined strengths make us the partner of choice for 
most governments," Raymond says. 
Exxon Mobil will beat Shell on all important financial and operating criteria (see table). Upstream, Exxon remains 
heavily dependent on North America, while Mobil relies more on a broad spread of projects outside its home 
region that is more reminiscent of Shell. Based on end-1997 figures, Exxon Mobil would have upstream 
production of 4.5-million barrels oil equivalent per day and reserves of 21-billion boe, against Shell's 3.7-million 
boe/d and 19-billion boe. Exxon has substantial production in Alaska and Canada and opportunities in the 
deep-water US Gulf of Mexico. Mobil's main growth asset in the region is its large holding off Canada's east 
coast, starting with the Hibernia development (37#39-16). 
Mobil has important oil production in Nigeria, in West Africa, and gas output in Qatar, in the Mideast Gulf 
(37#48-02). Exxon lacks significant production in either region, but has built a strong exploration portfolio offshore 
Angola (37#32-07). In Russia, both are involved in Sakhalin oil and gas developments in the Far East (37#44-06). 
In the Caspian, Exxon has interests in Azerbaijan, whereas Mobil is strong in Kazakstan and Turkmenistan. 
Exxon has few upstream projects in Latin America, although it is a major player downstream. Mobil is more 
involved in the region's upstream, with operations in Argentina, Peru, and Venezuela, and Brazilian deals in the 
works. 
Natural gas is a core element for both majors, with relatively little overlap and a lot of apparently complementary 
strengths. Both Exxon and Mobil produce one-third of their worldwide gas in North America. However, while 
Exxon sells its output direct, Mobil's is sold through Duke Energy. Roles are reversed outside North America. 
Almost half of Exxon's gas is produced in Europe, where its NAM Dutch partnership with Shell represents one of 
its most important profit centers. Exxon then sells its output through Gasunie, another Dutch company, in which it 
owns 25%, again alongside Shell and this time also the government. In the UK, too, most Exxon gas is produced 
through a co-venture with Shell, and Exxon sold its marketing assets to the Anglo-Dutch major last year 
(37#41-07). Mobil, by contrast, had seemed set to become a leading challenger of the Shell-Exxon duo in the 
rapidly liberalizing European market. 
It could be argued that Exxon has, in effect, bought itself the strategy that it had apparently lacked for coping with 
European gas deregulation. And Europe isn't even the best part of Mobil's gas empire. That honor still goes to 
Indonesia, where Mobil makes a notable chunk of its profits each year by supplying gas to the 12-million ton a 
year Arun liquefied natural gas facility. However, there are doubts about the long-term future of this project's 
reserves while Exxon has huge Asian gas reserves and a shortage of evident outlets. In Qatar, Mobil's Qatargas 
LNG scheme came on stream last year, and it is now working on that country's second LNG development, 
Rasgas. Mobil has been studying possibilities for regasification terminals in Turkey, Italy, and India. Exxon has 
no existing LNG interests. 
The downstream and petrochemicals sectors are likely to attract the closest attention of regulators. In the US, 
Exxon Mobil will be broadly similar in size to the Shell-Texaco-Aramco downstream alliance, with retail shares of 
around 13% and 14%, respectively. Exxon Mobil may have to sell retail outlets in the Northeast, where it would 
have 8,700 stations. Regulators may also consider forcing the new company to sell a refinery on the US Gulf 
Coast, although this is by no means certain. Exxon Mobil would have 1.37-million barrels a day of gross capacity

Page 24 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
on the US Gulf Coast, out of a regional total for all refiners of 7.2-million b/d. Exxon Mobil's own nationwide US 
capacity would be 1.89-million b/d. 
The picture in Europe is complicated by Mobil's existing downstream alliance with BP. Noto concedes that the 
deal with Exxon "does have implications for our existing deal with BP in both fuels and lubes," but says that talks 
haven't yet started with BP on how the issue might be resolved. Analysts suggest the most likely outcome is for 
BP to acquire Mobil's 30% stake in the refining and products marketing side of the business. Prospects for 
lubricants, where Mobil is the lead partner with 51%, are murkier (see super merger story). 
In Asia, Exxon has refining capacity of around 650,000 barrels a day, and Mobil around 660,000 b/d. This will 
create a regional force on a par with Shell and Caltex that will be particularly strong in Japan, where Exxon has 
equity capacity of 210,000 b/d and Mobil 260,000 b/d. Part of this was already pooled in an alliance, and with the 
Japanese oil industry starting to restructure, Exxon Mobil is almost certain to rationalize its assets in that country. 
In Singapore, where bigger has always meant better, the new group will have an opportunity to rethink refining, 
trading, and petrochemical strategies. The two companies together control 530,000 b/d of Singapore's refining 
capacity, or 42% of its total ahead of current leader Shell's 435,000 b/d. Some observers expect the 230,000 b/d 
Exxon refinery to be connected to Mobil's 300,000 b/d plant by pipeline.

The prospective $240-billion union of Exxon and Mobil that was announced last week would mark another giant 
step in a consolidation process that is rapidly altering the entire, long-stable structure of the international oil 
industry. In an exclusive telephone interview with EIG, Exxon Chairman Lee Raymond and Mobil Chairman 
Lucio Noto discussed some of the implications of creating "Exxon Mobil," both for their companies and for the 
industry as a whole. This interview initially went out to Energy Intelligence Briefing subscribers on Dec. 2, the day 
it took place. 
Q. How significant do you expect the likely reopening to private oil companies of Mideast oil fields to be for the oil 
industry as a whole and for Exxon Mobil as a company? Do you expect the fact that you are a US company to be 
an advantage in some countries as this process unwinds? Raymond: We have had long historical ties in the 
Mideast. We were both partners in the original Aramco. In the Near East Development Corp. [in Iraq]. In Abu 
Dhabi. And we were partners in the Iranian consortium. Both of us have extensive ties there in the industry and 
also in the societies. We both have large investments there. I would fully expect that would be to our advantage. 
To start letting investments back in, so to speak, I think was inevitable. I think that it was driven somewhat by 
technical factors and somewhat from a financial point of view. They need the best tools available to develop those 
resources. Obviously there are overtones in the political arena, too. Far be it from us to speculate on that. But 
clearly the Crown Prince was interested in talking to American companies, and I can understand that. Clearly the 
Kuwaitis are interested in talking to American companies, too. Noto: Some people are tying the reopening to the 
level of prices. I'd like to reemphasize that the opening is not just tied to oil prices. If you have a one-prop 
economy, and oil is fundamental to your future, you really want to have the best possible standards, practices, 
and technology. A partner stays with you through the ups and downs. It has to live with your successes and also 
has to live with your failures. Let me tell you, it hones your performance quite a lot. So I'm pleased that we're 
beginning to see this, and I hope that it gives us a lot of opportunity for profitable investment. I'm not speaking 
now for anybody else. I'm not speaking for the combined company. But at Mobil, we'd love to be there, as long as 
we think we can earn a fair and profitable return for our shareholders that compares well with other opportunities 
that we're turning down because we have to prioritize. But just to be there to wave the flag is not my bag. 
Q. Are you confident there will be good returns? Or are you saying that's a concern? Noto: We don't know, 
frankly. We had a dialogue. My sense is that all of us at that meeting were heartened by the fact that the Crown 
Prince, the Foreign Minister, in addition to the oil minister and a number of other officials, paid enough attention to 
the process that they were there personally. So I'm hoping the opportunities will be good, but at this point, I can't 
tell you. Raymond: I would say that I was heartened in the sense that, in the meetings, the Crown Prince was 
very clear in saying that he understood that anything that would be done would have to be in the mutual interest 
of both the kingdom and the companies. From the interactions I've had with him and others, I'd say that they do 
understand that, over a long period of time, there has to be the expectation of a reasonable return for the 
companies to be involved. 
Q. Do you think that the possibility or even probability that this process could lead to a long period of low oil prices 
is one of the factors that is driving mergers in the industry, including your own? Raymond: You recall back in 
1986, everybody said that oil prices were going to be low for a long time, too. This industry seems to have a view 
[that is] "easy glum, easy glow." When things are great, they can only get greater, and when things are awful, 
they can only get worse. I don't think the kind of low prices we have now are going to persist for a long period of 
time. But on the other hand, I don't think we're going to see runaway prices in the near term, either. I guess the 
other comment I have to put in here that we always have to in the oil business is that there's still a political 
overlay. I'm not at all suggesting that we have any insight into that area. But having said that, the facts are that 
there continues to be pressure in the industry to be among the most competitive on a cost basis. To be a top-tier 
company. That's what Exxon's tried to do. That's what Mobil's tried to do. And I'm confident that the new 
company will be able to do it better than either would have done alone. 
Q. What is likely to happen now to the BP-Mobil downstream arrangement in Europe, both in refining and 
products marketing, and in lubricants? Noto: Let me simply say that we recognize that this proposed buy-in

Page 26 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
between Mobil and Exxon does have implications for our existing deal with British Petroleum in both fuels and 
lubes, and that we intend to work diligently with both BP and the European competition authorities to try to come 
up with a solution that's a win-win for all the parties involved. We're just at the beginning of the beginning of that 
process, and I would be foolhardy to try and speculate as to how it would come out. But we recognize it's an 
issue, and we're confident that we can do something to solve it. I tried to reach [BP Group Chief Executive] John 
Browne yesterday just after we released the announcement, because I did want to speak to him personally. But 
regrettably, he was on a business trip. I did send him a note, and I'm hopeful that, early next week, we'll be able 
to chat and start a process to see how we resolve this. 
Q. How concerned are you about the antitrust review process, both as regards the outcome and as regards the 
possibility that it might become a long, drawn-out ordeal that would impede bringing the companies together? Do 
you think that BP Amoco is benefiting in this regard from BP's high-profile, pro-environmental stance? Raymond: 
There are a lot of things we can't talk about in detail because until it [the merger] is approved, we're still 
competitors. People need to understand that when they start asking us about the FTC [Federal Trade 
Commission]. We understand the FTC's role. We understand what they need to do. We've had a preliminary 
meeting with them our people have and suggested that we'll provide whatever information they need. We'd like to 
get the process moving, see where there are issues, and see what can be done to deal with those issues. We 
obviously may not have the same view that they do on everything. I'd be surprised if we do. But that doesn't mean 
that there won't be a way to deal with those issues, and it's our intention to try and do that, and do it as 
expeditiously as we can. 
The next question was BP's position on the environment versus Exxon's and Mobil's. I think our views are 
consistent with each other. I wouldn't expect those to change, and I would have the hope that the antitrust 
regulators look at their issues from an antitrust point of view. If there are others who have issues they want to 
discuss with us in another arena, we'd be happy to discuss with them. 
Q. The synergies between the two companies in natural gas appear to be enormous on a global scale. Can you 
talk about how you see using the complementary assets and skills that you have in gas to build up the business? 
How important do you think natural gas will be for the future of the combined company? Raymond: The gas side 
of the business is probably one of the more attractive features of Exxon and Mobil together. I think the track 
record Mobil has had, for example, in the LNG area is unique in the industry and is a clear strength. The strong 
position that Exxon has in the European gas arena puts another perspective on it. In North America, of course, 
we're both significant producers in the US. We both have interests in Western Canada, and Mobil has a very, 
very strong position in eastern Canada. So I think when you look at the gas side of the business, it's really a 
unique combination. I do also believe that gas to the extent there is flexibility in the marketplace is the choice of 
energy in the future. So in terms of the gas business, it's a great opportunity for Exxon Mobil. Noto: I would 
certainly agree with that. If you look at the use of gas whether it be LNG; or whether it's pipeline sales of gas, and 
I think you'll see more of those develop outside the US and Europe; or whether it's gas-to-liquids technology in 
the future, to be able to monetize some gas resources which perhaps it would difficult to do otherwise; or whether 
it's developing a power outlet associated with the gas supply it seems to me the two companies are very well 
positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. I do believe that gas will grow faster than liquids. Half of our 
proved reserves are gas. So we welcome that. We welcome the future that we see there. You talk about global 
warming. If there's a potential risk with greenhouse gases, if you can get the world to start using more of this gas 
and, for example, less coal, you can make a significant impact and probably on a quite economic basis. So this is 
an area where I hope that, 10 years from now, whoever is running the company will look at what we are trying to 
do today and say, they really got it right. 
Q. Do you expect to see a lot more mergers and acquisitions in the oil industry? And how do you think this may 
affect your combined company? Raymond: Far be it from us to speculate on specific things that other people are 
going to do. But I think that if you stand back and look at a moving timeline over a long period of years, the only 
thing you can conclude is that there will continue to be consolidation. Certainly in the US industry there will be, if 
simply because the amount of oil and gas that's going to be produced in the US particularly liquids is going to 
continue to decline, which by itself is going to force consolidation. And I think that, with some of the national oil 
companies becoming more aggressive, they're going to force consolidation outside the US. 
Q. When you say national oil companies are becoming more aggressive, do you mean in the downstream sector? 
Or in the upstream outside their country? What are you thinking about? Raymond: How about yes to that. 
Q. In an earlier interview with EIG, Mr. Noto queried the notion that a company can necessarily do more and get 
that much greater productivity by being larger. Others in the industry have made a similar point. So, to what 
extent are mergers just being driven by Wall Street? Noto: You've got to understand that size is not the driver in 
this. You really need to understand this. If you think that size is the driver, then if Shell went out and bought I don't

Page 27 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
know Chevron and ENI tomorrow, that means they would be better than we would be. I think that really misses 
the issue. We spent a lot of time yesterday trying to talk about the discipline of capital management in the long 
term. Forget about the short-term benefits. We aren't doing this just to get $2-or $3-billion in cost savings. We 
certainly embrace that. We want to get it. But that's not the motivator here. The motivator goes well beyond that. 
What I'm afraid of in all this commentary is that people are focusing on size and bigness, and "Gee, they want to 
see themselves up in the Fortune 500." Raymond: I come back to the comment I made yesterday, and I make it 
again. The objective is to be the best at what we do. If it turns out that we're also the biggest, that's fine. But if we 
weren't the biggest, that would be alright too. You ask yourself the following question: Shell has a lot more volume 
than Exxon, so why does Exxon make more money? 
Q. So how do you make more money by being together than you did apart? Raymond: By being able to manage 
our capital base more effectively together than we could do apart.

Principals in the $80 billion takeover of Mobil Corp. by Exxon Corp. would shrink from the comparison, but a 
persuasive argument can be made that the mega-deal that rocked the petroleum industry last week is the most 
major defining event for Big Oil since the Exxon Valdez ran aground off Alaska in 1989. 
There is little doubt that that environmental disaster nearly a decade ago changed the rules of the game for Big 
Oil. That mammoth oil spill splashed all over the public perception of the petroleum industry, marking it in the 
eyes of many as the global despoiler. The Alaskan oil spill remains the single biggest reason for the continuation 
of offshore drilling moratoria imposed by President Bush. 
It isn't simply the size of the Exxon-Mobil deal that makes it so remarkable, although it is mammoth and had 
energy journalists last week scrambling for their thesauruses, in search of synonyms for big. Nor is it necessarily 
that Exxon's takeover of Mobil represents a reuniting of the two most significant entities that emerged from the 
Standard Oil Trust breakup in 1911, although the irony is striking. 
The Exxon-Mobil pairing isn't even a seminal event - British Petroleum plc's $48 billion acquisition of Amoco 
Corp. is pending review by both the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission. 
What makes Exxon-Mobil a defining event is that it represents incontrovertible confirmation that Big Oil's 
landscape is changing - BP and Amoco wasn't a fluke - to a sector in which a few colossal companies will be able 
to do the deals and make the profits in an environment dominated by crushingly low oil prices. 
The natural gas implications of the Exxon-Mobil pairing are considerable (14#49-04). The merger will result in the 
new company emerging as the dominant gas player in the Pacific Rim. The merger also puts a potentially 
interesting twist in how Big Oil responds to environmental concerns, and in particular, to the global warming issue, 
in which gas has a ponderous stake. 
Some fissures in Big Oil's solid front against environmentally driven inroads appeared to be developing into even 
bigger cracks with BP's emergence as an environmentally conscious company. The consensus was that those 
who would seek cooperative solutions with environmentalists grew stronger as a result of the BP-Amoco deal. 
Exxon Chairman Lee R. Raymond, on the other hand, has been an opponent of efforts to limit carbon dioxide 
emissions, and a foe of global warming zealots, consistently questioning the science as well as the motivations of 
the loudest green doomsayers. As chairman, CEO and president of Exxon Mobil, Raymond would bring even 
more clout to his side in the global warming debate. 
Nobody left as the winner in the Exxon Valdez debacle. One suspects in this case there will be winners, albeit just 
a few and of gigantic proportions.

New York -- Thus began Lee and Lucio's intensely personal quest to pull off the world's largest corporate merger, 
a deal between two companies that were once part of a monolithic whole but which, during 87 years apart, had 
grown as proud and self-sufficient as sovereign empires. 
For years, Raymond had insisted that others might seek alliances and mergers, but that Exxon could only be 
weakened by taking on a partner. Meanwhile, Noto had been looking for a huge acquisition or at least a merger of 
equals to lift his oil company, already the nation's second largest, into Exxon's league. 
SKEPTICAL 
Some of their board members were skeptical. Others were incredulous. 
Even as Raymond and Noto negotiated in secret, the lawyers for both companies continued battling in court over 
Exxon's accusation that Mobil had infringed on a patent worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And even after they 
had summoned their respective directors to gather in New York to ratify the deal, last minute hitches kept them up 
into the wee hours. 
The $80-billion agreement they reached demonstrates that even in an era of corporate mega-mergers that require 
the efforts of battalions of investment bankers and lawyers, the most important deals still can come down to the 
leaders' outlook and character. 
"To an unusual extent, the CEOs established this deal," said one participant. "Those two men deserve the credit." 
Both chief executives, passionately analytical, ordered up mountains of studies and scenarios to ensure the 
merger would work whatever the price of oil. But both also agreed to keep their lawyers and investment bankers 
far away until they had an agreement virtually ready to be drafted. Most of the discussions were directly between 
two executives who regarded each other as among their few equals. 
Those two leaders have had little to say themselves. And -- with their companies' habitual secrecy reinforced by 
fears that any leaks might sink the merger as regulators begin to examine it -- they have demanded their board 
members, aides and outside advisers remain silent as well. Thus, the accounts of those individuals with some 
knowledge of the deal-making process and willing to speak are fragmentary and sometimes contradictory. 
The origins of the deal rest on a series of obscure musings, dropped hints and preliminary approaches calling to 
mind the old joke about how porcupines make love -- very carefully. 
Exxon was once known as Standard Oil of New Jersey and Mobil as Standard Oil of New York, the two largest 
pieces of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust which was broken up in 1911. Initially, the two companies 
continued to share confidences as well as a headquarters at 26 Broadway in lower Manhattan. 
Succeeding generations of ambitious executives took the two companies in very different directions, but they 
came to face similar challenges. Most recently, the falling oil prices of the 1990s -- now lower after inflation than 
before the Arab oil embargo of 1973 -- has caused severe cutbacks that led to tens of thousands of layoffs at both 
companies. 
With the price of oil taking another disorienting step down this year, the companies' chief executives finally 
concluded they had done all they could on their own. "The easy things are behind us," Noto put it last week. "The

easy oil, the easy cost savings -- they're done." Mobil -- outflanked by Exxon, which is twice its size, and Royal 
Dutch/Shell Group, which is even larger -- began hunting for partners. 
In Europe, Mobil combined its refinery and marketing operations with those of British Petroleum, even agreeing 
to let the British brand predominate. It knew DuPont wanted to sell its Conoco oil company to the public or a 
sufficiently large buyer. 
Both B.P. and Amoco, the old Standard Oil of Indiana, were willing to discuss mergers of approximate equals. 
Meanwhile, according to one Wall Street executive, Mobil was also suggesting it might consider an outright sale. 
Investment bankers were encouraged just enough to present the idea to Exxon executives early this year, this 
deal maker said, but it appeared to fall flat. 
RATTLED 
No wonder. Raymond was still saying Exxon had no need to resort to the mergers and partnerships that weaker 
companies were trying. If Mobil was rattled by an agreement between Shell and Texaco to team up in refining 
and sales in the United States, Exxon remained combative. Raymond even boasted last year that his lawyers 
were reviewing the Shell-Texaco agreement on antitrust grounds, adding that suing one's rivals was "the 
American way." 
But then Raymond doesn't have to try hard to be intimidating. A PhD in chemical engineering, with a heavy 
frame, rumbling voice and jowly visage, he seldom hesitates to let reporters, analysts or aides know when he 
thinks what they are asking or doing is just plain dumb. 
These characteristics, combined with acknowledged technical brilliance, helped him drive his company to the 
limits of efficiency, while he remained cautious about costly new ventures abroad. But, according to associates, 
even Raymond was starting to bump against the limits of efficiency gains Exxon could achieve on its own. 
If Exxon was to take any action, he felt, it had to have the scale and substance to truly improve his company. He 
first broached the subject of Mobil with his board this spring, receiving enough encouragement to take the next 
step. 
By June, during an American Petroleum Institute meeting, Raymond and Noto were chatting about a Japanese 
refinery where they each have a stake, they told reporters after the deal was announced last Tuesday. 
"Maybe we ought to have a conversation about the U.S.," Raymond suggested, perhaps with a view towards 
countering the Shell-Texaco partnership. 
Noto responded in kind, saying, "Well, yeah, that and some other things." 
About three weeks later they met in the Washington area, where Mobil has its Fairfax, Va., headquarters. 
Discussions moved slowly at first. But as the men pondered whether to begin more serious talks, they saw that 
the two companies were more complementary than it had appeared. 
Their foreign ventures had surprisingly little overlap, with Mobil more devoted to developing natural gas. And 
Mobil's marketing ability -- it popularized the self-service gas station -- fit well with Exxon's huge and efficient 
crude oil volumes. 
Noto also agreed early on that Raymond would be the boss. Though both are now 60, there would be no 
awkward attempt at having co-chief executives. 
That Noto would accept a vice-chairmanship at the combined company, to be called Exxon Mobil, surprised 
some who know him. "Lou Noto is a very -- I don't want to say egomaniacal -- he has a very big ego," said William 
Randol, an independent analyst. 
Noto -- compact and balding, with a brushy moustache -- is much more the salesman and adventurer, a lover of 
sports cars and opera, comfortable chatting up reporters or literary luminaries. At the joint news conference on 
Tuesday, he repeatedly stepped in to rescue Raymond from awkward moments. Asked about their rapport, he 
said, "We do a bear act if you give us a moment." 
But to associates, Noto had been making it clear that even a company as huge as Mobil might not be able to go it 
alone. That conviction was reinforced in August, when British Petroleum announced its $48 billion takeover of 
Amoco.

That news reverberated at Exxon as well, although some executives there almost made a point of not dwelling on 
it. "That would not have been the Exxon style," said one official. 
As the talks turned earnest, the companies began exhaustive analyses. In a project code named Highway, using 
far fewer people than normal to preserve secrecy, they tested the merger's benefits for years to come at a wide 
range of oil prices. Even if prices unexpectedly rebounded, they concluded, the deal would pay. Last minute 
details kept senior executives up late Monday, leaving some wondering whether the documents would be ready 
for the boards' votes by the time the markets opened. With hardly an hour to spare, the Exxon board approved 
the deal unanimously. The Mobil board had one abstention. Minutes before the markets opened, the news was 
officially out.

IT was not until the deal was done and dusted that Exxon chief Lee Raymond's wife learned of the impending 
$82 billion merger with Mobil. 
Her only question was: 'Honey, will Mobil still sponsor Masterpiece Theatre?' 'Darned if I know,' Raymond 
replied. And darned if he cared about the TV show, which brings UK costume dramas to US screens. 
Raymond, a chemical engineer whose hobby is mathematics and is so secretive that no one within Exxon knows 
his wife's first name, had pulled off an unbelievable deal. That was all that mattered. 
The record-breaking $82 billion paid by Exxon to take over Mobil represents the biggest merger in history. The 
resulting $250 billion oil giant will top the superleague of oil majors with revenues of $200 billion, 123,000 
employees and worldwide production of 2.5 million barrels a day. 
Exxon shareholders will own 70% of the company and Mobil shareholders will hold the rest. 
The former rivals expect to achieve savings of $2.8 billion after two years. About $1.1 billion will be cut from 
production programmes while just over a $1 billion will be saved by streamlining the two. 
In Britain, where Exxon operates under the name Esso, the two employ 4,100 staff, operate 2,600 petrol stations 
and have a combined market share of 25%. 
THE merger trail began in a Wall Street office on a blazing June day and pulled in the biggest names in 20th 
Century capitalism. 
It was after a board meeting of Wall Street banker J. P. Morgan that Raymond drew aside Sandy Warner, 
Morgan's chairman. 
They discussed the difficult future facing the oil business and Raymond said he would like to arrange a deal to 
share facilities with Mobil. 
'Good idea,' Warner replied, 'but why not go one step further?' A second meeting was arranged, this one attended 
by Rod Peacock, a football-loving Liverpool-born analyst who is co-director of Morgan's natural resources group. 
His spreadsheets showed clearly that the two companies, which had been part of Rocke-feller's Standard Oil 
Trust until it was broken up in 1911, could be slotted back together perfectly. 
More meetings followed until Raymond gave his advisers the green light. 
The deal had to be kept a secret and was dubbed Operation Highway. 
Peacock handled the initial approaches to Lucio Noto, chief executive of Mobil, and knew that bringing the two 
together would be a test of diplomacy. 
Noto and Raymond could not be more different. Raymond is tall, hunched and speaks in a monotone. He has no 
known sense of humour and shuns the society functions that make Dallas, where he lives, the cultural capital of 
the south-west.

Page 33 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Noto is short and tough looking - some say he looks like a Hollywood gangster. But this appearance is at odds 
with his personality. He loves opera. He laughs, he is outgoing and, say insiders, he won't last two months once 
the calculating Raymond takes control. 
Insiders say it was Peacock who handled the details as the deal developed during the summer. He and colleague 
Ferrell McClean forced the pace from J. 
P. Morgan while investment bank Goldman Sachs nannied Mobil. 
The Exxon merger has not been greeted with rapture by the rest of the oil industry. Sir John Browne, chief 
executive of BP, conspicuously did not step forward to offer his congratulations. 
IN the Seventies, as former BP chief Bob Horton's right hand man, Browne helped pull BP out of the disastrous 
nosedive caused by a mistaken strategy of pouring cash into exploration. 
He earned his spurs rescuing Standard Oil Ohio, but last week Browne was handed a problem for which he had 
no answer Exxon's deal with Mobil has at a stroke eclipsed his own Pounds 67 billion merger with Amoco. 
The news will have been an unwelcome intrusion into the smoky meetings in Amoco's 80-storey office in 
downtown Chicago where cigar-puffing Browne and cigarette-smoking Amoco chief Larry Fuller decide which 
executives will run which parts of the new empire. 
Unwelcome the news might have been, but it was no surprise to Browne. 
He had approached Mobil as the ideal merger partner for BP, only to see the deal fall apart early this year. 
The corporate fit was perfect as Mobil would have given BP strength in the Far East and a far greater reach than 
the Amoco tie-up. 
But personality clashes between the top teams at the two companies blew the deal and Browne was left with the 
previously agreed hook-up in Europe on refining. 
BP will say only that it is watching the progress of the Exxon deal 'with great interest', but it is clear that it was half 
expected and Browne is fuming. 
He may even decide to make a representation to the Fair Trade Commission and the European Commission over 
Exxon's deal.

EVERY age gets the oil baron it deserves, real or fictional. During the 1970s, Saudi Arabia's Sheikh Yamani 
strode the world stage, sending shivers down the spines of western politicians and industrialists. During the 
1980s, as United States governments lavished huge subsidies on home-grown independent energy groups, it 
was the 10-gallon hat and beaming visage of Dallas's JR Ewing that symbolised the vices and occasional virtues 
of Big Oil. 
Today, as oil prices slide to their lowest since the late 1960s, oil combines merge and merge again, hoping 
`operating efficiencies' or job cuts will shield them from the worst effects of the price crash. Like drunks propping 
each other up, the great names of petroleum lurch into one another and do their best to stagger home safely. 
In this unheroic climate, there has been no obvious public face for the energy business. Until now, that is, with the 
biggest merger of them all. 
Hardly was the ink dry on the `definitive' marriage contract between giants Exxon and Mobil than commentators 
were reaching for the obvious historical parallel, John D Rockefeller's huge petroleum trust, Standard Oil, which 
was smashed to pieces by order of the US Supreme Court in 1911. 
But if Exxon Mobil is the new oil trust, who is to fill the shoes of Rockefeller, last of the great 19th century robber 
barons? First up for this doubtful acclamation is Lee Raymond, Exxon chief executive and trust-busters 
permitting head of what will be the world's largest corporation. Alternately brusque and technocratic, Mr 
Raymond evokes praise within the industry for his managerial skills and embarrassment among the same 
colleagues for his robust stance on issues such as global warming. 
Whether he will prove to be the Rockefeller of our time remains an open question, but he faces similar enemies to 
those of the late tycoon. A coalition of US states from the industrial north-east and the south-west has agreed to 
co-ordinate inquiries into the monopoly implications of the merger. North-eastern states want Exxon Mobil to be 
forced to sell petrol stations to maintain competition, while south-western states, such as Texas, where Exxon 
Mobil will have its headquarters, are concerned about dominance of the refining business. 
All of which may prove a trial for Mr Raymond, who is unlikely to win the title of the world's most charming 
executive. At the press conference to announce the blockbuster oil deal, he flicked aside one reporter's question: 
`To be candid with you, I'm not interested in your views about how we deal with the FTC [Federal Trade 
Commission].' But what he lacks in tact and diplomacy, 60-year-old Mr Raymond makes up for in hard-headed 
analysis reflecting his academic background: a PhD in chemical engineering and applied mathematics. He proved 
his toughness by almost single-handedly negotiating a $900m ( #539m) settlement with the Justice Department 
over the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. Mr Raymond's unyielding approach left some lawyers feeling as if they 
personally had been responsible for the spill in Prince William Sound in 1989. Exxon's hard line tarnished its 
image in the short term, but the company eventually rode out the storm. 
Exxon has also taken an unpopular stand on global warming, with Mr Raymond leading the charge on behalf of 
the energy industry against environmentalists. 
When he was chairman of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry trade group, he tried to head off efforts 
to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide which would probably force industries to reduce oil consumption.

Page 35 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
His bluntness sparked a furore during a meeting of the World Petroleum Congress last year. `Some people 
seemed astonished that someone would actually stand up in public and point out some of the scientific 
uncertainties and damaging economic consequences of the proposals under discussion,' Mr Raymond said. 
A tough nut he may be, but Mr Raymond wins high praise for the managerial skills that have made Exxon by far 
the most profitable of the oil majors. He joined Exxon in 1963 after getting his doctorate from the University of 
Minnesota, and worked in most of Exxon's operations. 
Work took him from the oil fields of Oklahoma to Aruba, and to corporate headquarters in Manhattan. Mr 
Raymond caught the eye of his superiors when he turned the $10m monthly losses at an Aruba refinery into a 
$25m profit in two years. 
`Lee Raymond is one of the most effective corporate players out there. He doesn't make a move without first 
studying the chess board,' says Dennis Carey, vice-chairman of the executive search consultancy, Spencer 
Stuart. 
Mr Raymond's low-key style fits the Exxon ethos. The company likes publicity about as much as it does a well 
blowout. When it moved its headquarters from New York, Exxon chose the relative obscurity of Dallas. Mobil, by 
contrast, opted for Washington after leaving New York, so it could be near the political movers and shakers. 
That reflects the two companies' different styles. Exxon is more conservative, taking a decision only after 
extensive studies and reviews. Mobil is more of a risk-taker and the merger will either combine the best that each 
has to offer or Exxon Mobil will be torn apart by different cultures. 
Mr Raymond's first test is to dispel any monopoly concerns among the Washington regulators and here he can 
rely on the political skills of Mobil chairman Lucio Noto. 
Mr Noto is more of a showman, more at ease both in the public eye and with Washington officialdom. A 
strong-willed character in his own right, Mr Noto is not expected to stay very long at the company in the role of 
number two. 
It will come as no surprise that Mr Raymond a former state champion debater from Watertown, South Dakota 
hates to talk about his personal life. 
He met his wife, Charlene, at the University of Wisconsin in the late 1950s and the couple have triplets. But he 
has rarely talked about them in interviews. 
As for the most worrying for investors parallel with Rockefeller, the 1911 break-up, it has to be remembered that 
Standard Oil was then mainly in the business of supplying paraffin for oil-lamps rather than petrol for cars. 
That said, a trust is a trust, although with pessimists warning that within a year or so the world will pass the 
half-way mark on oil reserves, Mr Raymond must be hoping regulators will be more impressed by the current low 
oil price than by the potential for Rockefeller-sized profits in an oil-starved future.

Robert Corzine examines the background to the mammoth merger of Exxon and Mobil. 
The Texan roots of the world's oil industry were much in evidence this week when Exxon and Mobil of the US 
announced the mother of all industrial mergers in a deal that will create the world's biggest company. Lee 
Raymond, Exxon's bluff chairman and the man who will lead the combined group, insisted that "biggest is not 
necessarily best". But, in true Texan style, he also signalled that if size was a by-product of being best, well, who 
was he to tinker with the natural order. 
Exxon's $75bn ( #45.6bn) takeover of Mobil, revealed in the Financial Times last week, sent shock waves 
through the industry. It was also a driving force in US and European stock exchanges throughout the week, as 
traders speculated which companies might be next to jump on the takeover/merger bandwagon. 
Although consolidation has been a dominant theme in the sector this year - especially after the announcement in 
August that British Petroleum was to take over Amoco of Chicago - few thought merger mania would reach the 
lofty heights of Exxon, the biggest US oil company and, in recent years, the most consistently profitable performer 
in the global petroleum industry. After all, Exxon, along with Royal Dutch/Shell, has long been in the industry's 
super league, entry to which was the main goal of the BP Amoco deal. 
The significance of the tie-up lies in the extent to which it reflects the turmoil facing the industry. The 40% 
year-on-year slide in crude prices in response to a global glut, and the collapse of many commodity petrochemical 
markets because of Asia's problems, are only the latest and most obvious signs of trouble. 
Even before the price slide, big oil was struggling with growing global competition at a time when its internal 
efforts to cut costs and boost volumes were slowing. "Most of us had already done what we could on our own," 
said Lucio Noto, Mobil's chairman, explaining why he was prepared to surrender his company's independence. 
News of the Exxon-Mobil link inevitably evoked memories of the old Standard Oil Trust created by John 
D.Rockefeller; both Exxon and Mobil were key parts of what generations of American school children were taught 
was the original evil empire of the corporate world. Not surprisingly, Raymond moved quickly to ease fears of a 
new monopoly in the making, although he acknowledged that competition authorities in the US and Europe were 
likely to subject the deal to intense scrutiny. Although divestments will probably be needed to satisfy the 
regulators, many analysts assume the deal will be approved eventually. But does it follow automatically that what 
is good for Exxon - and big oil in general - is good for investors? 
The evidence is mixed. When BP triggered the oil merger wave, its shares received a boost that has since been 
embedded in the price. The premium has even survived the subsequent fall in oil prices - which threatened this 
week to slip into single digits for the first time since 1986. The prospect of BP's proven cost-cutting skills being 
applied to Amoco's asset base, combined with clear industrial logic and little overlap of assets, clearly caught the 
market's imagination. 
Exxon's move was also welcomed by the markets. But the other big oil deal of the week - the takeover of 
PetroFina of Belgium by Total of France - triggered a steep slide in Total's share price, much to the surprise of 
Thierry Desmarest, Total's highly-respected chairman. That prompted some to ask if investor enthusiasm for big 
oil mergers was confined to the very top tier of the industry. Or were investors so jaded they had grown tired of 
the big oil shake-up story after only three deals? Or was there something peculiar to this particular deal that 
caused shareholders to question it?

Page 37 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The answer is important because it could shed light on what might happen next in the sector. Unfortunately, it is 
not straightforward. 
The simple explanation is that there were worrying aspects to the deal, not least of which was the high price. But 
Total was perhaps more a victim of its own success. Investors had bought so throughly into the company's 
strategy - which management said precluded the necessity of a big deal - and were so unprepared for what 
looked like a sudden and inexplicable departure that they started selling Total shares, albeit into a falling French 
market. 
The lesson is that subtle deals which surprise shareholders, and do not make absolutely clear where promised 
cost savings and synergies will come from, may win the market's approval over time. But they can also create 
initial confusion that leads to a share price plunge. And that, in turn, could open the door to competitors, who may 
exploit any share price weakness and launch a counter-offer. 
But history also suggests that, the further down the consolidation chain they are, the less likely it is that 
companies will attract a share price boost. In many cases, the industrial fit will be less obvious, and there is 
always a danger that investors will see such deals more as panic-induced shotgun marriages than perfect 
partnerships. 
However, in the absence of an oil price recovery, the financial pressures on big companies to merge - or, at least, 
to enter into wide-ranging alliances for those who cannot quite bring themselves to the altar - will remain acute, 
especially if those who do get together begin to deliver on the billions of dollars in promised cost savings. 
And investors should not under-estimate another Texan trait that runs deep in the cultures of big oil companies on 
both sides of the Atlantic. Like Texan longhorns - the tough breed of open range cattle that, along with oil, was a 
pillar of the state's early economy - they display a stubborn streak of individual independence. But when trouble 
looms on the horizon, a powerful herd instinct takes over and they stampede in the same direction.

The Mobil-Exxon merger has been described as a new oil shock, writes Cameron Stewart. 
Yet analysts disagree over whether the takeover - creating the world's biggest company - will result in higher 
prices at the bowser JOHN D. Rockefeller, the robber baron of America's gilded age, would no doubt have 
enjoyed the news this week that two pieces of his old empire were merging to create the world's largest company. 
The planned $US80 billion ($129 billion) takeover of Mobil by Exxon - the biggest corporate union ever - 
re-assembles a part of the famed Standard Oil company founded by the late billionaire last century and broken up 
by the US Supreme Court in 1911 because of its monopoly of the US oil market. 
"Rockefeller's Revenge," declared one angry US consumer group. But Exxon Mobil, as the new company will be 
known, is a far less glamorous creation than a Rockefeller might have hoped for. 
That is because Exxon Mobil was born out of weakness, not strength. The global oil industry today is in crisis. 
Prices have fallen to their lowest levels (in inflation adjusted terms) since 1973 due to oversupply; a sharp drop in 
demand because of the Asian economic downturn; and the inability of OPEC to agree on production cuts to stem 
the glut of oil. As one commentator noted this week, bottled water is now more expensive than oil. 
According to Exxon and Mobil, the only way to avoid tumbling profits in this climate is to merge - a move which 
they say will benefit consumers by creating savings of $US2.8 billion. If the merger is approved by regulatory 
authorities, the new oil behemoth will command annual sales of $US204 billion in operations spanning 150 
countries. It will surpass General Motors as the world's largest company and Royal Dutch/Shell Group as the 
largest oil company. 
The Wall Street Journal has described the merger as "the third oil shock of the post-war era" after the oil price 
rises which followed the 1973 Arab oil embargo and the fall of the shah in Iran in 1979. 
It is the latest and most dramatic merger in a year of recordbreaking corporate unions in the oil, banking, 
telecommunications and auto industries. 
Both Exxon and Mobil have tried to play down the sense of crisis which led them to the altar. "This is not a 
combination based on desperation," said Mobil chief executive Lucio Noto. "It is one based on opportunity. But 
we need to face some facts. The world has changed. The easy things are behind us. The easy oil, the easy cost 
savings, they're done." Noto's claim that a merged Exxon Mobil will be better for consumers is being hotly 
debated and will be carefully examined by anti-trust regulators when they consider whether to approve the 
merger. Consumer groups fear the giant company will stifle competition and trigger more mergers, leading to 
greater industry concentration. 
The third biggest oil company in the US, Texaco, refused this week to rule out a merger in the wake of the 
partnership between Exxon and Mobil. They were previously the biggest and second biggest oil companies, 
respectively, in the US. 
"The proposed merger will predictably raise consumer prices, especially in the many areas where Exxon and 
Mobil compete directly," said Robert Weissman, co-director of Essential Action, a consumer group founded by 
Ralph Nader. 
Early consensus among oil industry analysts is that this will not occur. They point out that the new Exxon Mobil 
will only control 13 per cent of the US gasoline market. By comparison, before its breakup in 1911, Standard Oil 
controlled 85 per cent.

Even a company as large as Exxon Mobil would be unable to influence crude oil prices in a global market, they 
say. Market forces have proved far more effective at determining the price of oil in recent years than the actions 
of companies or OPEC. Exxon and Mobil say the merged company will have only about 1 per cent of proven 
worldwide reserves of oil. 
Many analysts believe that in the short term, the merger would be beneficial to consumers as other oil companies 
cut prices to compete with the new monster. "Plenty of bullets will be shot in ongoing price wars and no consumer 
ever died in a price war," economist Cary Leahey of Boston's Primark Decision Economics was quoted as saying. 
Lee Raymond, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon, who will be president of the merged company, denies 
that brute size was his goal. "I have always had the view that the objective is to be best. If in being best, you also 
have to be biggest, that's fine." 
Faced with the present weakness in the oil price, companies have no choice but to try to reduce the costs of 
producing oil in order to protect their profits. Mergers can help to achieve this by pooling the large amounts of 
capital and technical expertise needed to tap new oil fields. A larger company also has more clout when it comes 
to negotiating with foreign governments for drilling rights or to construct large offshore oil platforms. 
In the case of Exxon Mobil, the company will cut costs directly by shedding 9000 of its 123,000 employees 
worldwide. 
The current conditions which have led to the Exxon Mobil merger would have seemed unimaginable in the early 
1970s when the Arab oil embargo caused the price of oil to quadruple, heralding an era of doubledigit inflation in 
Australia and the US. 
At that stage, oil industry analysts were talking about oil reaching $US100 a barrel and politicians feared that the 
Arab world would be able to use oil to hold the western world to ransom for years. 
But this never came to pass. Internal squabbling among OPEC members and new oil discoveries ensured that 
the apocalyptic visions of western leaders were not realised. 
This year alone, oil prices have fallen more than 40 per cent and are approaching $US10 a barrel - the lowest 
price in inflation adjusted terms for a generation. 
"The Exxon-Mobil combination marks the end of the age of OPEC that began exactly 25 years ago," said The 
Wall Street Journal. "The merger punctuates the waning power of big oil everywhere." Cameron Stewart is The 
Australian's New York correspondent.

Lee Raymond will serve as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of the new company Exxon Mobil, 
while Lucio Noto will serve as vice-chairman. E. A.Renna will join the Board as Senior Vice President and 
Director. Four other Mobil executives will be tapped to joint the new board, expanding the total number of 
directors to 19. 
The company will be organized on a functional basis. The Upstream will report to H. J.Longwell, the Downstream 
to Mr. Renna and the Chemical business to R. Dahan. Worldwide downstream headquarters for the company will 
be located in Fairfax, Virginia. Worldwide upstream and chemical headquarters will be in Houston, Texas. Exxon 
Mobil will continue to use both the Exxon brand and the Mobil brand. 
According to the terms of the merger agreement between Exxon and Mobil, each share of Mobil will be 
converted into 1.32015 shares of Exxon. As a result of the merger, Mobil shareholders will own about 30 percent 
of the company, while Exxon shareholders will own about 70 percent. 
Upon completion of the merger, the company's name will be Exxon Mobil Corporation, with headquarters in 
Irving, Texas. 
"In the exploration and production area, for example, Mobil's and Exxon's respective strengths in West Africa, the 
Caspian region, Russia, South America, and North America line up well, with minimal overlap. Our respective 
deepwater assets and deepwater technology also complement each other well", Lee Raymond and Lucio Noto 
said in a joint statement. 
The merger is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, as well as other customary conditions. It is 
intended that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization in the United States and that it will be accounted 
for on a "pooling of interests" basis. 
Exxon and Mobil expect to provide details of the proposed merger to their shareholders prior to their annual 
meetings in April and May,1999 respectively. 
Exxon was advised on the merger by J.P. Morgan. Mobil was advised by Goldman Sachs.

Over the past few days, much has been made of the contrast in corporate cultures of Exxon Corp. and Mobil 
Corp. and the chance that it could undermine the success of the companies' planned merger. 
There's little doubt that "culture clashes" have sidetracked many a merger: Deals that looked good on paper and 
were sound in strategy have faltered because of unexpected friction between staffs. 
A recent study by consultants at the Roffey Park Management Institute shows that nearly 20% of unsuccessful 
corporate mergers fail because of differences in company cultures, twice as many as those that fall by the 
wayside because of business or strategy issues. 
But experts disagree with the notion that the business approaches of Exxon and Mobil are especially different, 
and they overwhelmingly deride any suggestion that so-called "culture clash" could impede the progress of the 
combination. 
Exxon has been known as an extremely conservative and secretive company, particularly in the wake of the 
public relations disaster that followed the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Lee Raymond personifies this subdued, tight-lipped approach. 
Mobil, on the other hand, has taken the opposite route, opening itself to global acquisitions and alliances under 
the outspoken leadership of Lucio Noto. The company sponsors "Masterpiece Theatre" on public television and 
runs newspaper ads explaining its beliefs on contemporary issues. 
But analysts say the differences between the two majors' corporate cultures pretty much stop there. 
"Clearly the two guys at the top are different, but the rank and file are essentially the same," noted analyst Alvin 
Silber of Herzog, Heine, Geduld - himself a former Mobil man. 
And analysts even discount the impact of any personality conflicts at the top, noting that Raymond and Exxon will 
have the final word on all decisions. 
Analysts praise Noto for the deal that he hammered out for his shareholders - in which he commanded a 30% 
premium for the company - but there's no doubt that, as vice chairman of Exxon Mobil Corp., his management 
role will be limited. 
"He'll have about as much power as the vice president of the United States," quipped Michael Wang, mergers and 
acquisitions analyst at John S. Herold. 
Most experts wouldn't be surprised if Noto steps down entirely from the combined company at some stage. A 
severance package - the details of which are somewhat mysterious - could be a good inducement. Some sources 
estimate the plan at $6 million in cash and potentially $15 million in stock options. 
It's true that the companies have recently adopted divergent upstream strategies. 
Exxon has conservatively relied on the depth of its asset base and focused on limited growth through internal 
measures. Mobil, by contrast, has aggressively pursued overseas expansion through acquisitions, as displayed 
by its buyout of Australia's Ampolex Ltd. 
But Exxon's acquisition of Mobil - easily the largest industry buyout ever - proves that it has changed its tune. 
"They've opened up their upstream in the biggest way possible," Wang said. He doesn't discount the potential for 
further Exxon acquisitions in the near future, either.

Downstream, analysts said the two companies run their businesses in very similar fashion. Each has endured 
painful cost-cutting and efficiency measures over the past decade to make operations as lean as possible. 
"They've each grown accustomed to downsizing," Silber said. 
As the nation's No. 1 and No. 2 oil companies, Exxon and Mobil also have similar management structures and 
compensation and reward structures. 
On that score, BP Amoco - the pending mega-merger between British Petroleum Co. plc and Amoco Corp. - is 
likely to encounter more culture clash than Exxon Mobil. 
U.K. executives are generally not paid as well as their U.S. counterparts and BP Amoco will be a London-based 
firm. 
Analysts also see Amoco as a cost-heavy company - one that "carries a lot of fat" - whereas BP is known as a 
savage cost-cutter, having halved its staff over the past decade.

Oil market to be tight after key merger. 
Oil market to be tight after key merger.

COMPETITION in the domestic oil market will become fiercer after Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp merge to save 
costs and offer greater benefits to consumers. 
The Exxon-Mobil merger would strengthen their lubricant business in Thailand and make them as big as the 
Shell companies in Thailand with a current market share of around 24%, John Withrington, chairman of the Shell 
Companies in Thailand, said. 
The two oil companies announced a $77.2bn link-up on Tuesday, in a deal that will cost $2bn and 9,000 jobs. The 
new company, to be called Exxon Mobil Corp, will be the world's largest publicly-traded company in terms of 
revenue, surpassing General Motors Corp. It will have a stock market valuation of $238bn easily eclipsing Royal 
Dutch/Shell, currently the world's top oil company with a market capitalisation of $101bn. 
The new entity will be able to produce 2.5m barrels of oil a day with a projected 28% share of the overall market. 
Both firms have extensive operations in the Asian region, ranging from operations in the Natuna Island oil fields of 
Indonesia to pipelines, refineries and petrol stations. 
In the world market, the new oil giant will become more powerful with cost reduction. However, in Thailand, the 
two partners would not achieve much cost reduction since Mobil Oil Thailand Ltd captures only around 1% of the 
market share, while Esso Thailand Plc, Exxon's oil and refinery operation in Thailand, holds around 17% at 
almost the same level as Shell, Withrington said. 
"We continue to see fierce cost-cutting in the market with greater benefits to customers," he added. 
Esso Thailand and Mobil Oil Thailand currently operates around 860 petrol stations and 80 stations, respectively. 
The Petroleum Authority of Thailand is the market leader with a 26-per cent market share and around 1,500 sites 
nationwide, followed by Bangchak Petroleum Plc with around 1,000 stations. Caltex Oil Thailand operates 581 
sites. 
Chitrapong Kwangsukstith, PTT's deputy governor for Corporate Plant and Development, said the world's largest 
oil companies will gain many benefits in the global market. However, it would not have much of an impact in the 
domestic oil retail market with the price of oil products having dropped to a 20-year low. Lower refining margins 
were a driver for the merger. 
Exxon chairman Lee Raymond told a press briefing in New York that the possibility for a collaboration in the 
region, especially in Japan, was one of the factors which made the match so attractive. 
Analysts said the economies of scale achieved through the merger should allow both companies to cut costs, 
leading to lower prices for end-users. Consumers in Japan, India, China and South Korea, which are all net oil 
importers, should benefit in particular. 
However, crisis-ravaged Indonesia, which relies on oil for about a third of its export revenue, and other net oil 
exporters such as Malaysia and Brunei could be hit hard by lower oil prices. 
"With the merger, the new company would implement restructuring efforts aggressively and provide cheap oil to 
consumers. Oil prices, which are already so low owing to excessive supply would fall further following the 
merger," Ryuji Uto, an oil sector analyst at Fuji Research Institute in Tokyo, said. 
The merger came as crude oil prices hit historic closing lows in London on Tuesday with prices for January 
contracts for the benchmark Brent crude closing at $10.21 a barrel. 
The merger may not be good news for many of Asia's smaller oil companies, or for some regional governments 
hoping for foreign help to explore potential offshore fields.

Page 46 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"This is negative for oil companies," said Janet Yang, oil and petrochemicals analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in 
Hong Kong. 
"Also Asian companies are financially weaker after the crisis, so a lot of the producers along the chain with high 
debts were looking at multi-national oil companies in the hope of aligning themselves or being acquired. 
"This giant merger will temporarily take the focus off Asia," she said, adding that Burma, Vietnam and the 
Philippines had all been hoping for foreign help in the oil sector. 
Few analysts doubt the merger will lead to a shake-up in the global oil industry which could see Asia lose out still 
further as companies consolidate overlapping assets in the region. 
"There's going to be mergers and there's going to be a cutting of capital expenditure and exploration in the next 
12 months," an industry analyst in Australia said. 
"With a lot of these mergers taking place you're going to see a consolidation of refineries," he said, adding oil 
firms may be tempted to move refineries closer to big oil fields in the United States and the Middle East at the 
expense of Indonesia and Malaysia. 
The combined company will become the biggest oil major refining in Asia and the third-biggest overall refiner in 
the region, including capacity owned by national oil companies. 
Analysts said Exxon's Asian refining capacity of 592,000 barrels per day would be added to Mobil's 662,000 bpd 
to total 1.254m bpd. This would place them as Asia's third-biggest refiner after China National Petrochemical 
Corp (Sinopec) with 2.56m bpd and China National Petroleum Corp's 2.07m bpd. 
The combined capacity surpasses Shell's, which has an estimated refining capacity of 1.206m bpd in Asia and 
the recently-formed Nippon Mitsubishi Oil Co with 1.03m bpd.

Mobil headquarters won't shut down in Exxon merger. 
Mobil headquarters won't shut down in Exxon merger.

WASHINGTON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The lights aren't going out at Mobil Corp.'s headquarters now that Exxon has 
agreed to buy the company. If fact, they've just become more colourful. 
At Mobil's corporate headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia, on Wednesday, the day after the largest corporate merger 
in history was announced, employees were greeted with the company's 21-foot Christmas tree blazing with those 
large lights that were popular in the 1950s. 
Even though 9,000 jobs, about 7 percent of Exxon and Mobil's combined work force of 122,700, are expected to 
be cut as a result of the merger, the mood of Mobil employees was not gloom and doom. 
Workers seemed festive at the company cafeteria (it could have been the lunch special, it was Wienerschnitzel). 
One employee even joked to his colleague: "Where's your tiger shirt?" referring to Exxon's corporate mascot. 
So why aren't the 2,000-plus people working at Mobil's Fairfax campus worried about losing their jobs? 
First, if the merger is approved by federal regulators, Mobil's corporate office campus would become the 
headquarters for the combined company's global "downstream" operations, which covers retail gasoline and 
lubricant sales, as well as refining. 
That means overseeing 48,500 gasoline stations worldwide and 50 refineries producing 6.1 million barrels of 
petroleum products a day, according to Mobil spokesman Bob Cummings. 
After the U.S. Federal Trade Commission reviews the proposed merger, though, that network of retail gasoline 
stations could be pared somewhat, due to antitrust concerns. 
Second, anyone who loses his job will get four weeks of pay for every year worked at Mobil. That's double the 
company's normal severance package. 
A lot of that extra pay would go to Mobil's high-level employees of "upstream" operations, involving oil exploration 
and production, who would not be needed in Fairfax, Cummings said. 
They could be offered jobs at the merged company's office in Houston, which will oversee upstream operations; 
be relocated to international offices, or take a severance package. 
In any event, they would not likely be able to cross over to downstream jobs and remain at the Mobil's Fairfax 
corporate campus, according to Cummings. 
"A person who is in the upstream has a small chance of moving to a different line of business, like a downstream 
job," he said. 
Mobil President Eugene Renna held two forums with employees on Tuesday to discuss the merger. He said 
while there would be job cuts, he didn't know where they would occur. "It's total speculation at this point," said 
Cummings. 
At other locations around the world where Mobil has large numbers of employees, including London, Tokyo, 
Singapore and Calgary, Mobil executives flew from company headquarters with a similar message.

Page 48 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Workers also saw an eight-minute message from Mobil's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lucio Noto, 
which was taped early Sunday morning, in which he announced that Exxon and Mobil had agreed to the terms of 
a merger. (Noto and Exxon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lee Raymond didn't actually sign the 
$76.6-billion merger deal until 8:45 a.m. EST on Monday.) 
In his taped message, Noto, who wore a sweater and slacks instead of a business suit, said the merger with 
Exxon would not be without pain, because there would be some downsizing. However, he said every effort would 
be taken to ensure the impact on Mobil employees was minimised. Noto said the merger was necessary for 
Mobil's health and profitability, adding that employees should be very proud of their accomplishments. 
On Wednesday, Exxon's stock fell 37.5 cents to $71.25 a share, while Mobil's stock gained 43.75 cents to 
$84.1875, both in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.

Washington -- Now, a merger plan under consideration by Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. -- formerly known as 
Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey and Standard Oil Co. of New York -- would put the two biggest chunks of the 
John D. Rockefeller oil empire back together again. 
During the intervening nine decades, much has changed in the oil industry: Cars have become commonplace, 
Saudi Arabia has replaced Texas as the world's key producer of crude oil, and natural gas that was once burned 
off as an unwanted byproduct has become a valued commodity of its own. 
Ruthless oil empire builders such as Rockefeller, Marcus Samuel and William Mellon have been replaced by a 
cadre of corporate managers unknown to the average consumer. 
But in many ways the oil industry retains much of its initial character: making fortunes by squeezing pennies at 
the retail level and spending lavishly to acquire valuable oil and gas reserves. 
Though no longer a big political target, Exxon and Mobil might still be treading on sensitive terrain by 
contemplating a merger of America's two biggest oil companies. 
Anti-trust enforcement has taken a much more lax position toward corporate mergers over the past 20 years, but 
the Standard Oil case in the early 1900s was among those that defined anti-trust law for the entire century. 
"I find it hard to see that the (Exxon-Mobil) merger won't be a very difficult one domestically," said George Keller, 
former chairman of Chevron, formerly known as Standard Oil Co. of California and another corporate descendant 
of the Rockefeller empire. 
Keller predicted that the combined Exxon-Mobil might have to sell off as much as a quarter of its U.S. assets to 
satisfy anti-trust concerns. 
Oil analysts say that likely sell-offs include service stations in the northeast, where the two companies have a 
combined 30 per cent or so in market share; a refinery on the Gulf of Mexico; and assorted other marketing and 
pipeline operations. 
Exxon and Mobil certainly aren't the first oil giants to contemplate marriage. Their combination would be the 
culmination of a wave of oil company mergers that actually began in 1979 with Shell Oil Co.'s $3.2-billion 
acquisition of Belridge, a California heavy oil producer. It was the biggest acquisition in U.S. history at that time. 
In 1981, Conoco (another Standard Oil descendant) fled into the arms of DuPont Co. -- for $7.8 billion -- to 
escape a hostile takeover. 
In 1982, Occidental Petroleum Corp. bought Cities Service Co., one of the industry's top 20 companies, for $4 
billion. 
In 1984, Mobil bought Superior Oil, America's largest independent oil company, for $5.7 billion, and Texaco won 
a messy, and costly, $10.1 billion battle for Getty Oil. 
Then, in 1985, Chevron topped them all with its $13.2 billion all-cash purchase of Gulf Oil Corp. For the first time 
since the Standard Oil breakup, a major integrated oil company went out of corporate existence.

Page 50 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Most of the oil takeover battles of the 1980s, however, were sharply different from the deal Exxon and Mobil are 
considering. 
In the early 1980s, oil prices were high and most analysts predicted they would climb steadily past $40 a barrel. 
Monday, crude oil was trading for about $11 a barrel, and new oil supplies could come on stream if Iraq returns to 
the world market. 
In addition, Asia's economic swoon has dampened demand, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
can't stop bickering, and new technologies, such as the planned Toyota hybrid gasoline-electric car, could cut into 
oil demand. 
The deals of the 1980s were mostly acquisitions paid in cash. Analysts say the buyers often overpaid and 
borrowed heavily, saddling themselves with debt. The Exxon-Mobil deal would most likely be done with an 
exchange of stock, leaving the new company relatively free of debt and with a powerful cash flow for new 
projects. 
In the early 1980s, many takeover battles were initiated by people like oilman T. Boone Pickens or corporate 
raider Carl Icahn, who believed it was cheaper to explore for oil on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange than 
in the ground. 
The $2 billion dry hole drilled in December 1983 in the Mukluk prospect off the coast of Alaska by Standard Oil 
Co. (Ohio) contributed to stock exchange prospecting. 
By contrast, the Exxon-Mobil talks are motivated by a desire to tap cost-cutting possibilities rather than simply 
control of oil reserves. 
Executives in both eras share one thing, though: They can profit handsomely. 
The phrase "golden parachute" first appeared in reference to the multimillion-dollar stock package that Conoco's 
chairman walked away with after his company was sold. 
Today, said oil analyst Alvin D. Silber of Herzog, Heine, Geduld, "there's very little else oil company chairmen can 
do to get their stock price up to an attractive level." With their stock options, he said, there is "a very attractive 
payday for the CEOs who make these deals." 
Analysts warn that corporate restructuring in the cyclical oil industry can have unforeseen consequences. Though 
many observers expected Standard Oil to suffer from its 1911 breakup, four years later the stock prices of the 
baby Standard Oil companies had doubled or more. 
Keller said that even though Chevron's acquisition of Gulf looked pricey at the time, "it was clearly worth what we 
spent for that." In an interview Monday, he said that "there were a few real nuggets there." 
Since the takeover, Chevron has watched production from former Gulf fields offshore Angola rise five-fold and 
become one of Chevron's two biggest sources of profit, Keller said. 
At the time of the merger, he added, Chevron was counting on only two years of operating profits because of 
political instability. Gulf oil production in Nigeria has been valuable, too. 
Gulf's chemical operations, depressed at the time of the merger, bounced back and became profitable. 
The two companies fit well together in the United States, too, Keller said. Their combined share in gasoline 
marketing put them in a strong position. "Where a major doesn't have 10 per cent of the market, it is hard to be 
competitive," he said. 
Many of the ballyhooed deals of the 1980s, however, were "terrible," said Constantine Fliakos, a veteran oil 
analyst for Merrill Lynch & Co. "They took years to digest." 
Oil prices collapsed in 1986, sharply reducing the value of oil assets in the ground. Debt took years to pay down. 
Goodwill writeoffs hurt earnings. 
In addition, companies ran into personnel problems, and many suffered from low morale. 
"Let's not kid ourselves," said Fliakos. "Putting companies like this together is not easy. There will be pain, turmoil 
and instability."

Page 51 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The cost savings Exxon and Mobil are seeking could also be difficult to achieve. 
Fliakos estimates that the combined company could ultimately save $3 billion to $4 billion a year in costs. But 
other analysts are more skeptical. 
Silber said savings figures are "pulled out of the air." 
Even Fliakos said that any savings could take several years to realize. "The idea that there will be instant cost 
savings is a lot of baloney," he said. 
In contrast to the beginning of the century when Standard Oil was a business and political power to be reckoned 
with, many analysts see the giants of the oil industry -- once known as the Seven Sisters -- in a relatively weak 
position. They need to compete against international firms like Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which has made 
alliances with Texaco Inc., and British Petroleum, which acquired two of the Standard Oil descendants, Amoco 
(formerly Standard Oil Co. of Indiana) and Sohio (Standard Oil Co. of Ohio). 
"The Seven Sisters are aging. Some of them are expiring," said Silber. "It's not unnatural to see mature industries 
consolidate." 
But other analysts say that the big oil companies shouldn't overstate their difficulties. Either Exxon or Mobil has 
the money to bid on oil exploration tracts anywhere in the world and to make money even in a tough market. 
"Some people say Mobil can't survive without merging with Exxon," Fliakos said. "That's a lot of hogwash."

EXXON yesterday stunned Wall Street with the details of its record-breaking $82bn (#60.5bn) agreed bid for 
Mobil. Shareholders will receive an unusually large 32% premium in the world's biggest merger. 
News of the deal leaked out last week, but analysts did not expect Exxon to pay such a substantial premium, 
especially as both companies admit that Mobil initiated the talks after falling far short of profit projections. BP paid 
a 20% premium for Amoco in their $63bn merger. 
One explanation, suggested by Wall Street analysts, for the high premium is that Lucio Noto, the Mobil executive 
chairman, had to be compensated for relinquishing control over the company. Lee Raymond, the Exxon 
executive chairman, will hold the top job in the combined company and Mr Noto will be made vice-chairman. 
As well as assuming Mobil's debts, Exxon will pay $99 for each Mobil share in a stock swap. The combined 
company will have a market value of $250bn, ahead of Royal Dutch/Shell Group as the world's biggest quoted 
energy company. Together the two groups employ 120,000 people. Exxon hopes to achieve cost savings of up to 
$3bn. 
Exxon shareholders will own 70% of the company and Mobil shareholders the rest. If the deal does not close, the 
guilty party is liable to pay a $1.5bn break-up fee. 
The deal is expected to be closely scrutinised by US and overseas regulators. Takeover experts have speculated 
that it could take at least nine months to close the transaction. The merged group would have 20.743bn barrels of 
oil and gas reserves, 1.631m barrels per day of oil and gas production and 6.66m barrels of refining capacity. 
The deal is the latest combination to hit the oil industry, which has struggled in the face of weak oil prices and 
high costs. Yesterday oil traded at $10.40 a barrel. 
Wall Street analysts have given mixed reviews to a combined Exxon-Mobil. Some questioned the benefits for 
Exxon, even though it will gain greater access to North Sea oilfields, potential lucrative deals with Saudi Arabia 
and a stronger presence in the US refining and marketing arena. 
Culture clashes and labour disputes are feared ahead of the proposed 10% labour reduction. Exxon is known as 
an extremely conservative and rigid company, while Mobil has pursued innovative programmes to cut costs and 
improve productivity.

It was hardly a surprise, but it's actually happened: a deal for the world's biggest ever merger, creating a true 
giant of the oil industry. 
The new Exxon Mobil Corp. - effectively an Exxon Corp. takeover of Mobil Corp., the U.S.'s second-biggest oil 
company - will have market capitalization of around $240 billion at current prices, setting it head and shoulders 
above the closest rival, Royal Dutch/Shell Group. The deal also dwarfs the merger of BP Amoco, previously the 
hottest play in the oil industry's round of consolidation. 
The merger still causes some surprise among analysts, given Exxon's traditional resistance to both acquisitions 
and asset growth. But reading between the lines, it's clear that Exxon is pursuing continued earnings 
improvement as much as - perhaps more than - size. 
There's no doubt about who's the dominant partner. The merged company will be called Exxon Mobil, and will 
retain both companies' brands. But Exxon chief Lee Raymond scoops up three top titles - chairman, chief 
executive and president - while Mobil's Lucio Noto is relegated to vice chairman. 
Exxon will own 70% of the new company and will dominate its board, with 13 of 19 representatives. Mobil gets 
only six seats, with two for acting officials - Noto and Eugene Renna, demoted from president and chief operating 
officer to senior vice president in the new company - and four for appointed nonemployee directors. 
The headquarters will be at Exxon's home of Irving, Texas, although worldwide downstream operations will be 
handled out of Mobil's site in Fairfax, Va. Global upstream and chemicals will be run out of Houston, marking 
further Exxon bias. 
But Mobil's shareholders have been rewarded handsomely: The transaction gives them 1.32015 shares of Exxon 
for each Mobil share, valuing the latter at $99 at the time of the deal's announcement. That represents a near 
one-third premium to the value of Mobil shares before rumors started swirling a week ago, and of 15% to the 
closing price on Nov. 30. 
Mobil's stock ended up closing down $2.44 at $83.75/share Tuesday, while Exxon's dropped $3.31 to $71.75. 
The deal is expected to be neutral to Exxon's earnings next year and accretive thereafter. It is officially valued at 
$80.1 billion, though that fluctuates along with Exxon's share price. 
Exxon Mobil will be organized on functional lines. Renna will head the downstream, with the upstream and 
chemicals led by Exxon men - Harry Longwell and Rene Dahan, respectively. 
Both companies have been champions of this decade's quest for shareholder value. 
But they have pursued goals in very different ways, with Exxon's conservative and bureaucratic approach 
contrasting with the idiosyncratic style of Mobil under Noto. 
Clashes of culture are widely regarded as one of the greatest obstacles to successful corporate combinations, 
especially in "mergers of equals" with shared responsibilities at the top. That appears to have been resolved by 
the submissive role of Mobil and its senior officials. 
The pressure for Mobil to agree to some form of alliance has intensified since British Petroleum Co. plc and 
Amoco Corp. announced their merger in August. Mobil had discussed merger plans with both companies, and 
more recently has held talks with other players. It is no stranger to corporate deals, from its purchase of Superior 
Oil in the 1980s to the more recent acquisition of Australia's Ampolex.

The deal seems unusual for Exxon. Since the last oil price slump in 1986, it has eschewed growth in the name of 
higher profits and shareholder returns. It has also remained largely aloof from industry restructuring. 
But equity analysts had started to question how Exxon could further improve on last year's strong performance, 
when return on capital hit 16%. Bankers also noted that Exxon's shares have performed strongly this year, 
facilitating an all-stock deal. 
Exxon Mobil officially aims to bring $2.8 billion in annual "synergies" - essentially cost cuts. Analysts reckon the 
real figure will be higher, at $3 billion-$5 billion. There's already speculation that 10% of the combined work force - 
or around 12,000 jobs - will go. 
The two companies also reckon the merger "will enhance our ability to be an effective global competitor in a 
volatile world economy and in an industry that is more and more competitive. It allows us to manage our 
expanded, combined asset base to deliver increasing returns and growth to our shareholders while reducing our 
operating costs." 
Exxon remains heavily dependent on North America, with substantial production in Alaska and Canada, and 
opportunities in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico. Mobil relies less on the home region, although it has developed 
extensive interests off Canada's eastern coast. 
Elsewhere, Mobil has important oil production in Nigeria and gas output in Qatar. Exxon, meanwhile, has built a 
strong exploration portfolio offshore Angola. In Russia, both companies are involved in Sakhalin oil and gas 
developments in the far east. And in the Caspian, Exxon has significant interests in Azerbaijan, whereas Mobil is 
strong in Kazakstan, through its 25% stake in the giant Tengiz oil field, and Turkmenistan. 
Exxon has few upstream projects in Latin America, although it is a major player downstream. Mobil is more 
actively involved in upstream and had begun trying to develop downstream. 
Natural gas is a core element for both majors, but there's relatively little overlap. 
The downstream sector will attract the closest attention of regulators. In the United States, Exxon Mobil will be 
broadly similar in size to the Shell-Texaco Inc.-Aramco downstream merger. Exxon Mobil may have to sell retail 
outlets in the Northeast and could have to sell a refinery on the Gulf Coast. 
Exxon and Mobil officials have already met with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Raymond said 
Tuesday: "We would be absolutely amazed if the FTC did not say we have to rationalize some assets." 
Analysts don't expect U.S. regulators to block the merger, given that the Shell-Texaco deal has already been 
approved. 
But the picture in Europe is complicated by Mobil's existing downstream alliance with BP, where several 
developments are possible: The whole joint venture could be unraveled, with BP buying out Mobil; Exxon could 
simply take control of Mobil's share in the business; or Exxon Mobil could buy BP out. 
Analysts suggest the most likely outcome is for BP to acquire Mobil's minority 30% stake in the refining and 
marketing side of the business. They are less certain about prospects for lubricants, where Mobil is the majority 
partner with 51%.

Final agreement reached between biggest US giants Exxon and Mobil.

Merger mania gripped the global oil industry yesterday, after Exxon, the United States' largest oil company, said it 
had reached an US$80.1 billion agreement to buy Mobil, the second-largest US oil group. 
The move came as France's Total said it also planned to strike a $39 billion deal to merge with Belgium's 
Petrofina. 
The deals came as oil prices are languishing at historic 12-year lows, driven down by the sharp drop in demand 
following the Asian financial crisis, and a huge build-up in inventories which have created a glut in the market. 
Exxon Mobil becomes the world's largest industrial merger, and makes Exxon the world's largest publicly-traded 
oil company with 20.74 billion barrels of oil and gas reserves. 
It also has 1.63 million barrels per day of oil and gas production, and 6.66 million barrels of refining capacity. 
Exxon chairman and chief executive Lee Raymond will become chairman, chief executive and president of the 
merged company, while Lucio Noto, currently chairman and chief executive of Mobil, will become vice-chairman. 
Analysts said the sharp drop in oil prices and the increasing need for companies to cut costs and generate 
savings was a key imperative behind the mergers yesterday. 
Petrofina said its merger would help it capture substantial productivity gains, particularly in the oil-rich fields of the 
North Sea, and help it expand its position in the deep offshore fields in the US and Angola. 
The new Total Fina group, which will be the third-largest oil company in Europe, said it should also gain from joint 
management of refineries and marketing networks, and estimated that joint operating income should rise by about 
two billion French francs (about HK$2.73 billion) for the next three years. 
The increasing competition expected in Europe following the introduction of the euro next month, has also led to 
rapid consolidation across the oil industry, and follows a similar merger between BP and Amoco, which combined 
in August to create a firm with a total market capitalisation of $110 billion. 
Oil companies are facing extremely difficult trading conditions, and the confirmation of Exxon's merger with Mobil 
will leave the industry with effectively just three oil giants - Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon-Mobil and BP-Amoco. 
Yesterday it was confirmed that Shell had ended potential merger talks with the US group Texaco, but analysts 
say the latest deals will continue to put pressure on Shell to find a merger partner. 
Following its merger, Exxon will gain much greater access to North Sea oil fields, it will enable it to become more 
closely involved in Saudi Arabian projects, and a stronger presence in US refining and marketing. 
Exxon shareholders will own 70 per cent of the new company, but both brands are expected to be retained. 
Last year Exxon had a net income of $8.5 billion, generated on revenues of $137.2 billion, while Mobil's net 
income of $3.3 billion came from revenues of $65.9 billion. 
Its total petroleum product sales amount to 5.4 million barrels per day, and it operates 33,000 service stations 
worldwide, compared to Mobil's petroleum product sales of 3.3 million barrels per day and 15,500 stations 
worldwide.

TOKYO, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Among various reorganisation plans expected from a merger among Japanese units of 
Exxon and Mobil, one smaller refinery closure may be an eventual possibility, analysts said on Wednesday. 
Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp on Tuesday said they had agreed to merge, with Exxon acquiring Mobil for a record 
$76.2 billion in a stock transaction that will create the world's largest oil company. Exxon's Chairman and Chief 
Executive Lee Raymond also said on Tuesday that the union of the two U.S. oil giants grew out of talks about 
their Japanese refining interests. 
Exxon's wholly owned subsidiary Esso Sekiyu KK and Mobil's 100-percent subsidiary Mobil Sekiyu KK said on 
Wednesday that they had no further comment than Tuesday's announcement in New York. 
The joined firms will aggressively streamline their Japan operations, said John Chanoki, oil and chemicals analyst 
at HSBC Securities Japan. 
An analyst with a foreign oil firm said the 80,000-barrel-per-day Kawasaki refinery of Kygnus Sekiyu Seisei, a 
refining arm wholly owned by Tonen Corp could be a likely target for closure if the merged company should shut 
one. 
Exxon and Mobil each have a 25 percent stake in Tonen. 
The combined capacity of all Exxon-Mobil related firms, including Kygnus' 80,000 bpd, will be 490,000 bpd in the 
Kanto region, which includes Tokyo and Yokohama, even larger than Nippon Mitsubishi Corp's 460,000 bpd in 
the same area. 
Analysts said refineries with capacities under 100,000 bpd were more inefficient and may be weeded out as oil 
companies suffered from deteriorating earnings. 
Although not yet decided, Nippon Mitsubishi is widely believed to be shutting down the 75,000-bpd Kawasaki 
refinery of Mitsubishi Oil, bringing its capacity in Kanto down to 385,000 bpd. 
Mobil and Esso have not tried to spread their sales across the nation like other Japanese companies, but rather 
have remained and will remain focused on higher-yielding areas such as large cities and surrounding vicinities, an 
analyst said. 
So their high concentration of refineries in the main consumer areas of Kanto and Kinki - which includes Osaka - 
rather than being more spread-out like Nippon Mitsubishi, may not be a problem, the analyst said. 
Retail pumps would have to undergo some integration, analysts said. As of end-March, there were 59,615 
gasoline stations in Japan, and about 80 percent of them were said to be running in the red, they said. 
As of April 1, Mobil Sekiyu operated 3,400 gasoline stations, followed by Esso Sekiyu's 2,319 as of end-March, 
General's 2,184 as of end-September, and Kygnus' 949 at end-September, according to company data, and the 
Esso-Mobil total accounting for about 15 percent of national total. 
"The number of (Esso-Mobil) stations will be reduced, but they will likely build larger integrated outlets for 
maximum sales per station," said the foreign oil firm analyst.

$250bn Exxon-Mobil deal is biggest merger in history.

THE MAP of the world oil industry was redrawn yesterday after Exxon unveiled details of its $250bn merger with 
Mobil, and Total of France and Belgium's Petrofina joined forces in a $39bn European merger. 
Exxon Mobil represents the biggest merger in history and will create the world's pre-eminent oil major with 
revenues of $200bn, 123,000 employees and worldwide production of 2.5 million barrels of oil a day. 
The merged US oil giant forecast that it would generate savings of $2.8bn after two years and shrugged off fears 
that regulatory opposition could yet scupper the deal. 
Exxon Mobil estimated that rationalisation costs would reach $2bn but it declined to say how many job losses 
could be entailed. In Britain, where Exxon operates under the Esso name, the two companies employ a total of 
4,100 staff. 
However, shares in both Exxon and Total, the dominant partners in the respective mergers, fell on confirmation of 
the two deals as analysts questioned whether they were overpaying at a time of historically low oil prices. Exxon 
shares fell 5 per cent while Total shares took a battering on the Paris bourse, crashing by 8 per cent as the 
market opened. Brent crude slid to $10.43 a barrel. 
Analysts and oil industry observers have warned that Exxon Mobil will have to overcome serious competition 
concerns both in the US and Europe, where Mobil already has a joint venture with BP covering 6,000 petrol 
stations. 
European Union regulators are expected to force Exxon Mobil to unravel the tie-up with BP. This could result in 
BP buying back Mobil's 30 per cent stake in the $5bn joint venture at a knock-down price. 
Analysts said Exxon Mobil could also be forced into heavy disposals in the US, where it dominates the petrol 
market, particularly on the West Coast. 
However, Exxon Mobil said it did not expect any big anti-trust problems. It added that in the US it would be of a 
similar scale and size, both nationally and regionally, as other downstream joint ventures such as the BP-Amoco 
merger. 
"This will be a company with a market capitalisation of $250bn. It can afford to throw the regulators a crumb of 
say $5bn in asset sales or divestments," said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Fahnestock in New York. 
The Exxon Mobil deal reunites two of the seven sisters orphaned by the enforced break-up in 1911 of John D 
Rockefeller's United Standard Oil Trust. Exxon shareholders will own 70 per cent of the enlarged company and 
the chairman and chief executive of the combined group will be Exxon's current chairman Lee Raymond. 
Mobil shareholders will be left with 30 per cent of the merged group and are being offered 1.32 Exxon shares for 
each Mobil share they own. The deal values the smaller oil company at $76bn. 
Exxon, which was advised by the investment bank J P Morgan, estimates that the merger will improve its return 
on capital by 4 per cent within three to five years.

The main elements in the $2.8bn cost-saving programme are $1.1bn of savings through rationalisation of 
production programmes, $750m through "organisational efficiencies" and $300m each through the adoption of 
best practices and a more selective exploration programme. 
In the UK, Esso and Mobil together operate about 2,600 petrol stations and have a combined market share of 25 
per cent. Esso employs 2,500 staff and has a further 780 employees at Exxon Chemicals. Mobil employs 1,300 
staff in its oil and gas exploration division and a further 500 in the joint venture with BP. 
Total Fina will become the world's sixth largest oil group with revenues of $53bn and net income of $1.9bn. 
However, analysts criticised the price Total was paying. 
In Britain, Total and Fina have around 960 petrol stations and a combined market share of about 8 per cent. The 
two companies operate a refinery together in Immingham on Humberside.

Exxon, Mobil facing major culture clash

One company uses a stalking tiger in its advertising, while the other uses a whimsical flying horse. In putting 
together Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., those differences in image and culture aren't a small detail. 
Exxon, while huge, is also notoriously tight-lipped and conservative. "The tiger has become an icon for Exxon, 
representing power," says Allen Adamson, managing director of Landor Associates, a New York corporate 
identity and branding consulting firm. Meanwhile, Mobil, like its mascot, is more open, both to the public and to 
new ideas. 
While the chairmen of the two companies argued that their assets -- from refineries to gas stations to far-flung oil 
fields -- are a good fit, they may have a harder time making the case in terms of style. 
One investment banker, who asked not to be identified, said culture could be an issue that determines whether 
the deal ultimately works. Indeed, with the firms counting on $2.8-billion (U.S.) in savings, "the cultures of the 
companies have to be committed to meeting those goals and making them work," he said. 
Exxon, like chairman Lee R. Raymond, is subdued, awkward in the limelight and appears to be intently focused 
on efficiencies and cost-cutting. "He's the mother of all cost cutters," says William Randol, an independent oil 
analyst, of Mr. Raymond's relentless, 12-year effort to slash overhead. 
Exxon also is well known for its disastrous public relations effort in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. 
Despite revenue in excess of $130-billion, Mr. Raymond said in an interview late last year that a good day is a 
day when his company stays out of the news. 
Mobil, by contrast, wears its image on its sleeve. Always outspoken, the company took on the media in the 1970s 
with editorials and radio shows that accused the media of biased coverage during the oil embargoes. Mobil also 
raised eyebrows by becoming the first oil company to encourage energy conservation by urging the United States 
to improve its mass-transit system and set speed limits at 50 miles an hour. 
Both Mr. Raymond and Mobil's Lucio A. Noto played down their companies' cultural differences at a joint news 
conference yesterday. "Raymond and Noto get along pretty well," Mr. Noto said. "We may have different styles, 
but we share a lot of goals in common." 
But the differences were hard to paper over. Mr. Noto, for example, joked with reporters. But Mr. Raymond 
caustically responded to a reporter's question on antitrust strategy, "I'm not interested in your views of how we 
should deal with the FTC." 
But the differences are more than just the obvious ones. They run to the core of how the businesses are run. 
Mobil always has taken risks, venturing into natural gas back in the 1980s before it was popular with major oil 
companies. Mobil is as much a gas company as it an oil company. Mobil also ventured more confidently into 
Central Asia, taking advantage of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 
Gerald Kepes, a managing director at Petroleum Finance Co. in Washington points out, however, that although 
"Mobil is of a bolder mindset its risk-taking hasn't completely panned out," one reason the company might have 
decided to fall into Exxon's arms.

Exxon has been slower to react, a vestige of a culture that took months, or even years, of studies before a 
decision was made. "There were lots of reviews and lots of steps before anything could get done," Mr. Raymond 
said in the interview last year. Even now, the company's exploration and production strategy is criticized for 
remaining focused on the North Sea and North America. 
As Mobil's corporate headquarters shifts from Fairfax, Va., to Irving, Tex., industry experts wonder how much of 
Mobil's identity will survive. Noting that both companies moved headquarters from New York in the early part of 
this decade, Fadel Gheit of Fahnestock & Co., says, "Mobil moved to the Washington D.C. area because they're 
politically savvy. By contrast, Exxon moved to Dallas to disappear."

EXXON has agreed terms for its merger with Mobil, which was first mooted last week. 
The deal values Mobil at $76bn, making the agreement the largest corporate merger in history, beating the 
$72bn which Travelers Group paid for Citicorp earlier this year. The value of the combined group of $240bn will 
rival that of the largest company in the world, General Motors. 
Mobil shareholders will be offered 1.32015 Exxon shares for each Mobil they hold. 
The merged company, to be called Exxon Mobil Corporation, will be led by Exxon chairman and chief executive 
Lee Raymond, who will hold the posts of chairman, chief executive and president of the new company. Mobil 
chairman and chief executive Lucio Noto will serve as vice chairman. 
Both well-known brands will be retained after the deal. 
Observers felt that getting the two top men to work together would be difficult as Raymond is a conservative 
manager very much in the company mould whereas Noto has been more innovative, prepared to push Mobil 
aggressively overseas. However, Exxon has a strong reputation as a well-managed company which achieves 
consistently one of the highest returns on capital in the industry. 
The company cultures are different, with Exxon considered to be turned in on itself, exclusively promoting people 
from within, while Mobil is more open. The latter has been active in finding ways to cut costs, for example 
merging its European refining and marketing operations in Europe with those of BP. Personality clashes at the top 
are a frequent problem for mergers unless the hierarchy has been established in advance, as was the case with 
BP and Amoco. 
It is estimated that some 12,000 jobs will be lost. The new group will combine again the two principal components 
of John D Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire which was broken up by the US government in 1911.

A wave of consolidation and restructuring looks set to engulf the western world's oil industry as US and European 
companies yesterday announced separate deals that will intensify competition in a sector besieged by low prices. 
In New York, Exxon announced an agreed takeover of Mobil, valued at $75.4bn ( #45bn) based on afternoon 
share prices, in the world's biggest merger. The combined entity will be known as Exxon Mobil and will be the 
world's largest company in revenue terms. 
In Europe, Total of France confirmed it is to take over PetroFina of Belgium in a deal that will create the world's 
sixth biggest oil company, and Europe's third biggest, with a capitalisation of almost $40bn. 
The two moves are the latest response to the twin threats of low crude prices and a downturn in demand, 
especially in Asia. They follow British Petroleum's takeover last August of Amoco of the US. Analysts said they 
could trigger further restructuring. 
Even if antitrust regulators force some divestments, with a current market capitalisation of more than $240bn, 
compared with former leader Royal Dutch/Shell's $160bn-plus, Exxon Mobil will tower over its competitors. 
But the companies insisted that regulatory concerns may be overblown. The deal, revealed in the Financial Times 
last week, will set new standards for an industry that has been slow to follow the merger trend. 
Lee Raymond, Exxon's chairman, who will lead the new company, and Mobil's Lucio Noto, who will be his 
deputy, said they expected near-term cost savings of $2.8bn. Mr Raymond said he saw the deal resulting in 
9,000 jobs lost from a combined total of 123,000 employees. The two companies said the link-up would boost 
their competitiveness and ability to produce superior returns. 
"The merger will enhance our ability to be an effective global competitor in a volatile world economy and in an 
industry that is more and more competitive," the chairmen said in a prepared statement. 
The companies will control or supply almost 50,000 service stations between them. Last year they sold almost 9m 
barrels of petroleum products daily and had interests in 50 refineries. They earned about $12bn on aggregate 
revenues of $203bn. 
The smaller Total PetroFina deal is significant in that it suggests national sensitivities about the fate of former 
state oil companies in Europe are receding. 
Based on Friday's Total share price, its offer valued PetroFina at BFr 19,482 per share, valuing the whole group 
at BFr 456bn ($12.97bn). That was a 36.7% premium to Friday's closing PetroFina share price of BFr 14,250, and 
above analysts' estimates of a BFr 18,000-a-share offer on Monday. 
The French company's shares slid FFr 87, or 12.3%, to FFr 618 on the weak Paris market amid suggestions that 
the group had overpaid. 
The combined group, to be called Total Fina, will have 69,100 employees, 14,000 filling stations, reserves of 
5.7bn barrels of oil equivalent, and annual sales of $54bn. 
Exxon is advised by J.P. Morgan, Mobil by Goldman Sachs.

COMPANIES &FINANCE - INTERNATIONAL - Bigger asset base is key to future growth - EXXON CHAIRMAN 
SPELLS OUT REASONS. 
The pecking order for answering reporters' questions yesterday left no doubt about who will be in charge of Exxon 
Mobil. 
Although Lee Raymond, Exxon chairman, was careful to ensure that Lucio Noto, his vice-chairman designate, 
had a chance to respond, it was made abundantly clear what the relationship between the two strong-willed men 
will be: "I will work for Lee," said Mr Noto, who went on to wonder why so many people should be surprised. "After 
all," he said, "I worked for a boss for 32 of the 36 years I've been at Mobil." 
That answered one big question that has hung over the proposed deal between the two companies since it was 
first disclosed last week. 
Mr Noto also confirmed that companies such as Mobil had reached the limit on what they could do to take out 
costs and boost performance within the confines of a single company. "The BP Mobil deal in Europe showed that 
we had run up against those limits," he said. That made it imperative to "look outside the box" of conventional 
thinking for the next move to boost returns. 
Last night the two men went to some lengths to explain the rationale for creating the world's biggest oil company. 
The key to understanding the deal, said Mr Raymond, was not size per se, but the need to raise capital 
productivity in the light of an increasingly competitive environment: "That's the system that has worked in Exxon 
for the last 10 years." 
Although that system has enabled Exxon consistently to lead the industry in its most important performance 
measure - the return on average capital employed - it clearly had its limitations. Although all investments had to 
be of high quality in order to get the go ahead, over time greater amounts of capital might not be directed into the 
"most attractive core area", he said. That could be because of a lack of opportunities or merely because the time 
was not ripe to make the more attractive investments. 
An asset base that is 30% bigger will enable the enlarged group to tap opportunities and to fine tune individual 
business areas. 
But size and an expanded asset base will not alter the fact that Exxon Mobil will still be barred from some big oil 
producing countries, such as Iran and Libya, both subject to unilateral US sanctions. Mr Noto, who has been 
especially keen to see the US drop its opposition to oil investment in Iran, said the opening of such countries "was 
not an essential ingredient in this merger," although he expected the combined group to continue its lobbying in 
Washington.

Packed with details of expected financial and strategic benefits, yesterday's announcement of the formation of 
Exxon Mobil in the biggest merger on record addressed few of the cultural questions raised since word of the 
deal broke last week. 
But the planned structure made clear that though the Mobil brand will remain, its managers will be very much the 
junior partners following completion of a deal which will leave Exxon shareholders owning 70% of the new 
company. 
Lucio Noto, Mobil chairman will serve as number two to Exxon's Lee Raymond, and the enlarged 19-strong 
board will include only six of his colleagues. 
While logical, given the prominence of both company logos in world markets, maintaining two brands and their 
complementary marketing divisions may reduce the potential for early economies, estimated by the partners 
yesterday at about $2.8bn before tax. 
Yet the retention of the Mobil name may also help mitigate some of the cultural shocks inevitable in the process 
of grinding out the savings through plant closures, spin-offs and lay-offs. 
Although no job cut estimates were on offer from the companies yesterday, analysts said most were expected in 
marketing and refining, which account for about half the 123,000 total, and might run as high as 14,000. 
More details are expected as negotiations continue and the world's regulators tackle the biggest merger yet 
presented to them. Unusually, yesterday's official announcement did not name an expected completion date, only 
that details would be made available in time for the annual meetings next spring. 
Under the terms announced yesterday, the transaction is intended to qualify as a tax-free pooling of interests 
despite the disparity in the partners' sizes, in which Mobil shareholders will exchange their shares for 1.32015 
Exxon units. 
Valuing Mobil at $99 a share, the terms represent a premium of more than 30% over the company's closing price 
on November 24 when rumours of a link began to circulate. 
Touting the advantages of a merger, the companies said that beyond the near-term economies, they expected 
the link to allow them to enhance shareholder value longer-term by producing a higher return on capital employed 
than either could achieve alone. 
Mr Raymond and Mr Noto said the companies complemented one another "in almost every facet of the 
business". 
Although they are expected to be obliged by regulators to reduce their filling station and refinery portfolios, they 
claimed there were minimal overlaps between their exploration and production interests. 
"Respective strengths in West Africa, the Caspian region, Russia, South America and North America line up well," 
they said. The combination of technologies and management expertise would reinforce Exxon Mobil as "partner 
of choice" for nations seeking help and capital to exploit their reserves. With combined sales of natural gas of 
14bn cu ft a day, the new company would be well-placed in this fast-growing market, and there was a strong fit in 
lubricants.

Mobil is the world's leading lubricants marketer while Exxon is the biggest refiner of the base stocks used in their 
manufacture. 
In US marketing and refining, they said, Exxon Mobil would "approach the size" of competing downstream joint 
ventures which include Texaco's link with Shell and Saudi Aramco.

OIL giants Exxon and Mobil have agreed the biggest industrial merger in history. 
The #50bn deal which follows a host of oil mergers and takeovers will transform the global oil industry. 
Based on last year's figures, the new company will have revenues of #121.2bn. 
Exxon employs 2,500 staff in Britain at its Esso UK operation, mostly at Leatherhead, Surrey, and Fawley, Hants. 
It also has 780 staff at Exxon Chemicals, which operates from Fawley and Mossmorran, Fife. 
Mobil employs 1,300 at its oil and gas exploration division. 
Around 900 are based in London and 400 in Aberdeen. Another 500 staff work for a Mobil joint venture with BP 
on petrol stations and lubricants. 
While the deal is described as a merger, it is structured more like a takeover of Mobil by Exxon. Each share in 
Mobil will be replaced with 1.32 Exxon shares. 
Mobil shareholders would own around 30% of the company, which will change its name to Exxon Mobil 
Corporation, and the company will continue to use the Exxon and Mobil brands. 
No announcement has been made on job cuts, but the companies said they expected to create savings of about 
#1.7bn. 
Exxon Mobil, the world's biggest oil group, will produce daily 2.5m barrels of crude oil a day and sell 14bn cubic 
feet of natural gas. 
Exxon chief executive Lee Raymond will be its chairman, chief executive and president.

Oil-king: Exxon Corporation's $82.8-billion purchase of Mobil will create the world's largest oil company and 
reshape the industry. The Mobil takeover signals that more mergers are inevitable for companies seeking to 
slash costs, as profits tumble. The merger comes amid a wave of corporate combinations in the oil industry, 
which is battling the lowest prices in 12 years and the high costs of doing business. 
Exxon-Mobil deal 
No option but to merge 
Reed V. Landberg 
NOT since 1984 have investment bankers in the oil industry been so busy. Yet their work has just begun, with 
bigger mergers and acquisitions expected. Exxon Corporation, the top US oil company, today agreed to buy rival 
Mobil Corporation for $82.8 billions in the largest takeover ever. In France, Total SA disclosed plans to acquire 
Belgium's Petrofina SA for $11.6 billions. In August, British Petroleum Plc agreed to buy Amoco Corporation for 
$53 billions. 
Exxon's bid signals that more mergers are inevitable for companies seeking to slash costs, as profits tumble 
because of oil prices at a 12-year low, investors, analysts and industry executives say. 
Oil companies "don't have an option," said Mr. Richard Lewis, director of European fund management at 
WorldInvest Ltd. in London, which manages $1bn. "If you don't cut costs you're really in trouble." 
The BP-Amoco announcement in August was the first big oil industry merger since the $13-billion purchase of 
Gulf Corporation by Chevron Corporation in 1984. Behind-the-scene talks continued even as executives from 
Total to Atlantic Richfield Co. publicly professed their intention to remain independent. 
Since late summer, things have changed. Oil prices fell even lower. Brent crude prices today trade close to $10 a 
barrel, a 12-year low and less than half of last year's peak price. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries, which controls 40% of global supply, failed to agree last week on a way to reduce an oil glut, and the 
group will not meet again until March. 
With the spectre of prolonged low oil prices, companies such as the Royal Dutch/Shell Group are planning for 
prices between $12 and $16 a barrel for years, below the $15-20 range since 1986. Low prices are forcing 
cost-reductions in an industry that can spend $10 millions drilling a single well and $1bn or more building a 
refinery. 
"The industry believes the road ahead will be very bumpy," Sheikh Zaki Yamani, a former Saudi Arabian oil 
minister, said at a speech in London on Tuesday. "The industry has built up over the decades a vast, hugely 
expensive infrastructure. It will have to contract." 
Exxon's bid grabbed the attention of top figures in the industry because the Exxon Chairman, Mr. Lee Raymond, 
and the Mobil Chairman, Mr. Lucio Noto, run two of the industry's most efficient companies. Mergers, while tricky, 
can generate huge cost savings. The BP-Amoco merger is expected to save $2 billions a year. Exxon and Mobil 
expect to save $2.8 billions. 
Lower costs will be essential as companies scour the globe to develop the next generation of massive oil fields. 
With such huge gains possible, other companies are sure to follow Exxon and Mobil, which together will eclipse 
Shell as the world's top publicly traded oil company.

"In the past we were happy to be stand-alone," the Total Chairman, Mr. Thierry Desmarest, said. "The picture in 
the industry is clearly changing, as you can see by the number of mergers being discussed. There is a danger in 
staying fully outside the reorganisation of the industry." 
Around the world, industry executives and investors are wondering who will be next to merge. Total's bid for 
Petrofina would create the world's sixth biggest oil company and could be a wake-up call for Elf Aquitaine SA, 
which until now was Total's bigger rival in France. 
"What this does is leave Elf sitting on the sidelines and wondering what's next," said Mr. Keith Morris, an analyst 
with BNP Equities in London. "The two companies have been pretty much side-by-side. This puts Total well 
ahead." 
One option for Elf could be to increase its 43% stake in Compania Espanola de Petroleos SA, Spain's No. 2 oil 
company, by acquiring the remaining 57%. Elf managers also have shown an interest in bidding for another major 
oil company, once talking to DuPont & Co. about buying Conoco Inc. before the oil unit was spun off earlier this 
year. 
Elsewhere, analysts speculate Repsol SA of Spain could be considering a bid for YPF SA, Argentina's former 
state-run oil company. Repsol is among the bidders for a 14.99% stake in YPF worth $2 billions offered by the 
Argentine government. Smaller oil companies in Europe may be among the most vulnerable, though large 
government holdings are likely to blunt interest in Norsk Hydro SA of Norway, OMV AG of Austria and Eni SpA of 
Italy. As a result, Enterprise Oil Plc and Premier Oil Plc are the most likely targets in Europe, analysts said. 
In the US, analysts say Arco, Amerada Hess and Marathon Oil Co. could be vulnerable to takeovers. Chevron 
and Texaco already have a joint venture in refining and may be driven together, analysts said. 
A string of smaller acquisitions has occurred. Union Pacific Resources Group in March completed a $3.5-billion 
purchase of the Calgary, Alberta-based Norcen Energy Resources Ltd. Arco, the No. 7 US oil company, in June 
paid $3.3 billions for Union Texas Petroleum Holdings. In October, Kerr-McGee Corporation agreed to buy Oryx 
Energy Co. for about $3 billions, while Seagull Energy Corporation and Ocean Energy Inc. agreed to a stock 
swap now worth about $791 millions. 
The lower tier of oil companies, sometimes called the independents, are ripe for greater consolidation. "We are 
going to see a lot of mergers," said Ms. Lisa Floyd, vice-president of business development at the Houston-based 
Apache Corporation. "Maybe not the magnitude of a BP/Amoco or Mobil/Exxon, but a lot of independents could 
come together."

EXXON AND MOBIL SIGN MERGER AGREEMENT. 
EXXON AND MOBIL SIGN MERGER AGREEMENT.

TWO-TEN NEWS NETWORK, London, December 1. This press release is transmitted on behalf of Exxon 
Corporation 
New York - Exxon and Mobil announced today that they have signed a definitive agreement to merge the two 
companies. 
Under the terms of the agreement, each share of Mobil will be converted into 1.32015 shares of Exxon. As a 
result of the merger, Mobil shareholders will own about 30 per cent of the company, while Exxon shareholders 
will own about 70 per cent. 
Upon completion of the merger, the company's name will be Exxon Mobil Corporation, with headquarters in 
Irving, Texas. 
L. R. Raymond will be the chairman, chief executive officer and president of Exxon Mobil Corporation. L. A. Noto 
will join the Exxon Mobil board of directors as vice chairman. 
E. A. Renna will join the board as a senior vice president and director. Four additional members of Mobil's board 
will be invited to join the Exxon Mobil board as non-employee directors, bringing board membership for the new 
company to a total of 19 directors. 
The new company will be organised on a functional basis. The Upstream will report to H. J. Longwell, the 
Downstream to Mr. Renna and the Chemical business to R. Dahan. Worldwide downstream headquarters for the 
new company will be located in Fairfax, Virginia. Worldwide upstream and chemical headquarters will be in 
Houston, Texas. Exxon Mobil will continue to use both the Exxon brand and the Mobil brand. 
"This merger brings together two outstanding organisations that share common values, htrategies and 
demonstrated track records of achievement," said Mr. Raymond and Mr. Noto in a joint statement. "The merger 
will significantly enhance shareholder value by enabling us to manage the combined assets of Exxon and Mobil 
to produce a higher return on capital employed than either company could achieve on a stand-alone basis. 
"The merging of these two companies will deliver significant near-term pre-tax synergies of about U.S $2.8 
billion," they said. "This merger will enhance our ability to be an effective global competitor in a volatile world 
economy and in an industry that is more and more competitive. It allows us to manage our expanded, combined 
asset base to deliver increasing returns and growth to our shareholders while reducing our operating costs. It also 
allows us to continue delivering quality products to our customers at competitive prices into the future. We are 
confident that with the exceptional quality of Exxon's and Mobil's employees, we will succeed in meeting these 
objectives." 
They noted that combining Exxon and Mobil will create a major global company, headquartered in the U.S., with 
the technology, the resources and the people to compete effectively with other companies of a similar or larger 
scale in the world oil industry of the 21st Century. "The relative strengths of our two companies are highly 
complementary," they said. "When combined, Exxon Mobil will provide better opportunities for both our 
shareholders and employees than those they would experience without this merger. By combining our operations, 
we also will be better able to meet the needs of our customers for quality products in the next century. It's a good 
match." 
"While we expect to benefit from a reduction of costs in the short-term, our real objective is to maximise growth 
and return on investment by successfully managing the existing assets of Exxon and Mobil and by selecting the 
best projects from the large portfolio of investment options that will be created by this merger," they said. 
"Combining the proprietary technologies and management expertise of the two companies also will reinforce the 
selection of Exxon Mobil as the partner of choice, creating additional resource opportunities in the future."

In discussing the strategic fit of Exxon and Mobil, Mr. Raymond said the two companies line up well with each 
other in almost every facet of the business. "In the exploration and production area, for example, Mobil's and 
Exxon's respective strengths in West Africa, the Caspian region, Russia, South America, and North America line 
up well, with minimal overlap. Our respective deepwater assets and deepwater technology also complement each 
other well." 
Exxon Mobil will have combined natural gas sales of about 14 billion cubic feet per day, giving the new company 
a solid position in this increasingly important worldwide fuel resource. Mobil also brings major LNG assets and 
experience to the combined company that complement Exxon's assets and technology with little overlap. 
Mr. Noto said that in refining and marketing, Exxon and Mobil each have significant global brand recognition, 
expertise and technology. "In the lubricant area, for example, Exxon is an important producer of lube base stocks, 
which fits well with Mobil's leadership in lubes marketing." 
In the US, Exxon Mobil will approach the size and scale nationally and regionally of the new downstream joint 
venture companies announced by other major competitors. Outside the US, Exxon Mobil will be competitively 
well positioned in key Asian markets and will have complementary positions in South America. The merger also 
builds on Mobil's significant position in Africa. 
"Chemicals are another area where there is a good strategic fit," said Mr. Raymond. "Exxon's chemical product 
line aligns well with Mobil's chemical products. The two companies also share a common focus on efficiency and 
site integration. Exxon Mobil should realise immediate benefits through sharing the proprietary technology and 
best practices of each company." 
Exxon and Mobil also bring important, state-of-the-art proprietary technologies to the venture that will greatly 
benefit the merged company. In exploration and production, this includes leading-edge geoscience technology to 
find and develop oil and gas reserves, arctic technology, and heavy oil technology. In refining, marketing and 
chemicals, this includes catalyst, synthetic lubricant and chemical manufacturing technology. 
The merger is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, as well as other customary conditions. It is 
intended that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganisation in the United States and that it will be accounted 
for on a 'pooling of interests' basis. In addition, the merger agreement provides for payment of termination fees of 
dlrs 1.5 billion under certain circumstances. The parties also have entered in an option agreement that grants 
Exxon the option under specified circumstances to purchase up to 14.9 per cent of the authorised but unissued 
common stock of Mobil. 
Exxon and Mobil expect to provide details of the proposed merger to their shareholders prior to their annual 
meetings in April and May, respectively. 
Exxon's programme of repurchasing its shares to reduce the number of shares outstanding will be discontinued, 
however, Exxon will continue to repurchase its shares to offset dilution from employee incentive programmes. 
Exxon was advised on the merger by J.P. Morgan. Mobil was advised by Goldman Sachs.

1 December 1998 
The Oil Daily 
TOILDA 
English 
(c) 1998 Content and programming. CNBC/Dow Jones Business Video, a division of CNBC/Dow Jones Desktop 
Video, LLC. 
Exxon Corp. looks primed to leapfrog Royal Dutch/Shell Group as the world's largest publicly traded oil company 
as it winds up talks with Mobil Corp. about a potential merger. 
Sources say a formal announcement is expected this week, possibly as early as today, after the companies 
confirmed last Friday that they were in "discussions concerning a possible business combination." 
If a full-blown merger goes ahead, the deal would be gargantuan - easily topping the tieup between British 
Petroleum Co. plc (BP) and Amoco Corp. - and would allow Exxon to overtake arch-rival Shell on all key financial 
and operational criteria. 
There's no doubt who would be the dominant partner: Exxon's current market capitalization of $177 billion dwarfs 
Mobil's $61 billion. Their combined capitalization of $238 billion would also comfortably beat BP Amoco's current 
$145 billion and Shell's $160 billion. 
But any move to unite the two U.S. majors may face some challenges from regulatory concerns and clashes of 
corporate culture. 
Such a merger would represent an unusual step for Exxon, which has deliberately eschewed growth over the past 
decade in favor of creating a lean and profitable organization. 
Chief Executive Lee Raymond is well-known within the industry for his refusal to pay premiums for "second-rate" 
assets. Exxon's last corporate acquisition of any weight was back in 1987 when it bought Celeron. 
While Mobil could hardly be considered "second-rate," analysts are still befuddled by Exxon's sudden 
gregariousness. 
"They've always taken a 'go-it-alone' approach and enjoyed great success. I'm more than a little confused by this 
move," says ABN-Amro analyst Eugene Nowak. 
Proof is also in the numbers: Exxon's return on capital employed in 1997 was 17%, exceeding all its peers. 
Nonetheless, some analysts say there have been signs of mounting frustration with Exxon - the U.S.'s largest oil 
company, and the world's biggest in terms of capitalization - as it appears to have limited potential for further 
performance improvement. As lean and efficient as it has become this decade, the prospect for further savings 
through self-help measures has dwindled. 
And there has been some grumbling about Exxon's slowness at finding and exploiting replacement reserves. 
Reserve replacement averaged just 103% during the five years from 1992-97, well below rival Shell's 133% 
average, according to PaineWebber Inc. 
The timing may also be right for Exxon to make a move. 
The recent surge in Western equities has unleashed a wave of mergers in other industries, as deals involving 
stock rather than cash again become attractive. 
But analysts say the latest slump in oil prices and their weak long-term outlook provide the greatest incentive for 
consolidation. 
Investment bankers say an all-stock bid for Mobil would typically command a premium of 20%-40%. Before 
merger rumors surfaced, Mobil shares were trading at around $75/share, implying a low-case bid of about 
$90/share, or some $73 billion.

Page 81 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
As for Mobil, the pressure to partner has intensified since the BP-Amoco initiative. In the past, it has discussed 
merger plans with both BP and Amoco, though talks reportedly foundered after questions about who would lead 
the combined company could not be answered. 
More recently, it has discussed the acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co. (Arco) or a merger with Chevron Corp., 
sources say. Among other initiatives, it also made a pitch for selected assets of Conoco Inc. 
"I think Mobil was running out of ideas. Then up comes Exxon and puts an offer on the table," a banker says. 
Analysts estimate the potential cost-savings for an Exxon-Mobil deal at $3 billion-$5 billion. For the sake of 
comparison, BP Amoco is targeting $2 billion in annual savings. 
If the deal is concluded, it could be especially tough for Mobil Chairman Lucio Noto. Described as a "street fighter 
from Brooklyn" by one New York analyst, Noto would surely have to defer control to Exxon's Raymond. And the 
idiosyncratic style of Mobil under Noto contrasts sharply with the conservative and secretive nature of Exxon, 
creating a real chance of a clash in corporate culture. 
Analysts say there would also be competition issues in the European downstream and parts of the United States, 
as well as the complication that Mobil already has a partner in the former, through its joint venture with BP. 
The BP venture could be the most obvious casualty of a deal. If the U.S. company has to sell to satisfy regulators, 
BP would be an obvious buyer. 
Exxon controls around 10% of the European retail market by volume, against BP-Mobil's 8%, according to 
consultants MarketLine. But this varies from country to country, and any Exxon-Mobil merger would have pockets 
of concentration. 
It's a similar tale in the United States. But there, the overall 
picture is not as daunting as might be imagined. Exxon-Mobil would control 17% of the retail gasoline market and 
14% of refining capacity, according to analysts Wood Mackenzie - matching the Shell-Texaco-Aramco 
downstream merger on both counts. 
Retail divestitures would be most likely in the Northeast, where Exxon-Mobil would have 8,700 outlets in PADD 1. 
Regulators may also look at forcing them to sell a refinery on the Texas Gulf Coast, where Exxon operates the 
427,000 b/d Bayway refinery and Mobil manages the 315,000 b/d plant at Beaumont. 
Exxon-Mobil would have reserves of around 21 billion bbl of oil equivalent (boe), compared with Shell's 19 billion 
boe. It would beat Shell and BP Amoco in both oil and gas production (see table). 
Exxon could clearly benefit from Mobil's impressive portfolio of upstream assets. 
Exxon remains heavily dependent on North America, where it still gets about 45% of its production. By contrast, 
Mobil gets only about a third from the region. Its inventory includes a 25% stake in the huge Tengiz field in the 
Caspian Sea; a 41.67% stake in a Venezuelan venture to produce and upgrade 120,000 b/d of extra-heavy 
Orinoco oil; and a dominant position in Eastern Canada. 
The partners would account for about 20% of U.S. gas output and have active interests in the Asia-Pacific region. 
It would also introduce Exxon to the liquefied natural gas business in Indonesia and Qatar, long a substantial 
source of earnings for Mobil.

EXXON CORPORATION 1st December 1998 
EXXON AND MOBIL SIGN MERGER AGREEMENT 
New York - Exxon and Mobil announced today that they have signed a definitive agreement to merge the two 
companies. 
Under the terms of the agreement, each share of Mobil will be converted into 1.32015 shares of Exxon. As a 
result of the merger, Mobil shareholders will own about 30 per cent of the company, while Exxon shareholders 
will own about 70 per cent. 
Upon completion of the merger, the company's name will be Exxon Mobil Corporation, with headquarters in 
Irving, Texas. 
L. R. Raymond will be the chairman, chief executive officer and president of Exxon Mobil Corporation. L. A. Noto 
will join the Exxon Mobil board of directors as vice chairman. 
E. A. Renna will join the board as a senior vice president and director. Four additional members of Mobil's board 
will be invited to join the Exxon Mobil board as non-employee directors, bringing board membership for the new 
company to a total of 19 directors. 
The new company will be organised on a functional basis. The Upstream will report to H. J. Longwell, the 
Downstream to Mr. Renna and the Chemical business to R. Dahan. Worldwide downstream headquarters for the 
new company will be located in Fairfax, Virginia. Worldwide upstream and chemical headquarters will be in 
Houston, Texas. Exxon Mobil will continue to use both the Exxon brand and the Mobil brand. 
"This merger brings together two outstanding organisations that share common values, htrategies and 
demonstrated track records of achievement," said Mr. Raymond and Mr. Noto in a joint statement. "The merger 
will significantly enhance shareholder value by enabling us to manage the combined assets of Exxon and Mobil 
to produce a higher return on capital employed than either company could achieve on a stand-alone basis. 
"The merging of these two companies will deliver significant near-term pre-tax synergies of about U.S $2.8 
billion," they said. "This merger will enhance our ability to be an effective global competitor in a volatile world 
economy and in an industry that is more and more competitive. It allows us to manage our expanded, combined 
asset base to deliver increasing returns and growth to our shareholders while reducing our operating costs. It also 
allows us to continue delivering quality products to our customers at competitive prices into the future. We are 
confident that with the exceptional quality of Exxon's and Mobil's employees, we will succeed in meeting these 
objectives." 
They noted that combining Exxon and Mobil will create a major global company, headquartered in the U.S., with 
the technology, the resources and the people to compete effectively with other companies of a similar or larger 
scale in the world oil industry of the 21st Century. "The relative strengths of our two companies are highly 
complementary," they said. "When combined, Exxon Mobil will provide better opportunities for both our 
shareholders and employees than those they would experience without this merger. By combining our operations, 
we also will be better able to meet the needs of our customers for quality products in the next century. It's a good 
match." 
"While we expect to benefit from a reduction of costs in the short-term, our real objective is to maximise growth 
and return on investment by successfully managing the existing assets of Exxon and Mobil and by selecting the 
best projects from the large portfolio of investment options that will be created by this merger," they said.

"Combining the proprietary technologies and management expertise of the two companies also will reinforce the 
selection of Exxon Mobil as the partner of choice, creating additional resource opportunities in the future." 
In discussing the strategic fit of Exxon and Mobil, Mr. Raymond said the two companies line up well with each

Exxon's respective strengths in West Africa, the Caspian region, Russia, South America, and North America line 
up well, with minimal overlap. Our respective deepwater assets and deepwater technology also complement each 
other well." 
Exxon Mobil will have combined natural gas sales of about 14 billion cubic feet per day, giving the new company 
a solid position in this increasingly important worldwide fuel resource. Mobil also brings major LNG assets and 
experience to the combined company that complement Exxon's assets and technology with little overlap. 
Mr. Noto said that in refining and marketing, Exxon and Mobil each have significant global brand recognition, 
expertise and technology. "In the lubricant area, for example, Exxon is an important producer of lube base stocks, 
which fits well with Mobil's leadership in lubes marketing." 
In the US, Exxon Mobil will approach the size and scale nationally and regionally of the new downstream joint 
venture companies announced by other major competitors. Outside the US, Exxon Mobil will be competitively 
well positioned in key Asian markets and will have complementary positions in South America. The merger also 
builds on Mobil's significant position in Africa. 
"Chemicals are another area where there is a good strategic fit," said Mr. Raymond. "Exxon's chemical product 
line aligns well with Mobil's chemical products. The two companies also share a common focus on efficiency and 
site integration. Exxon Mobil should realise immediate benefits through sharing the proprietary technology and 
best practices of each company." 
Exxon and Mobil also bring important, state-of-the-art proprietary technologies to the venture that will greatly 
benefit the merged company. In exploration and production, this includes leading-edge geoscience technology to 
find and develop oil and gas reserves, arctic technology, and heavy oil technology. In refining, marketing and 
chemicals, this includes catalyst, synthetic lubricant and chemical manufacturing technology. 
The merger is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, as well as other customary conditions. It is 
intended that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganisation in the United States and that it will be accounted 
for on a 'pooling of interests' basis. In addition, the merger agreement provides for payment of termination fees of

however, Exxon will continue to repurchase its shares to offset dilution from employee incentive programmes. 
Exxon was advised on the merger by J.P. Morgan. Mobil was advised by Goldman Sachs.

NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - They laughed. They joked. They complimented each other. 
But when it came down to the details of their record $76 billion corporate marriage, the top executives of Exxon 
Corp. and Mobil Corp. were as bashful as any newlyweds. 
An hour-long press conference in lower Manhattan yielded few answers about the corporate combination that will 
create the nation's biggest company, and the largest oil company in the world. 
Aside from the disclosure that about 9,000 jobs are expected to be cut from the combined company, Exxon 
Corp.'s Lee Raymond and Mobil Corp.'s Lucio Noto mostly skirted questions about potential antitrust difficulties 
and integration of the two companies. 
Instead, the executives stressed their solid relationship and the fact that the decision to join forces was meant to 
boost growth. 
"Today's announcement about a combination does not mean we could not survive on our own. But the easy times 
are behind us," Noto said, noting both companies have already cut costs and had been searching for a "quantum 
leap." 
They acknowledged that federal regulators will closely scrutinise the proposed merger, which would be the 
biggest in corporate history, but declined to discuss what assets might be sold to allay antitrust obligations. 
They also were coy about which oil giant made the initial approach about a transaction, only saying their talks 
began in June with a telephone call. 
"Lee and I have agreed that if you asked me that question, I would say he called first and if you asked him that 
question, he would say I called first," Noto joked. 
Noto also dismissed widespread speculation that he would have difficulty fitting into Exxon's severe corporate 
culture. Noto will serve as vice chairman while Raymond will hold the top jobs of chairman and chief executive of 
the merged company. 
"I have great admiration for Lou," said Raymond, who spent most of the news conference discussing slides about 
the operations of the combined company. 
And true to their personalities, Noto was slightly more glib. "Raymond and Noto get along pretty well," he said, 
referring to himself in the third person. 
"I'm going to work for Lee. I think I can adapt myself to do that."

NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. said on Tuesday they had agreed to merge in an 
$80.1 billion transaction that is expected to reshape the global oil industry. 
The deal is worth $99.09 per Mobil share based on Monday's closing stock prices. Terms of the transaction call 
for each share of Mobil to be exchanged for 1.32015 shares of Exxon. 
Mobil shares closed at $86.19 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. 
Exxon shares finished at $75.06. 
The merger announcement came four days after the two oil giants confirmed they were in negotiations. Exxon is 
the biggest U.S. oil company and Mobil is No. 2. 
The merged company, to be called Exxon Mobil Corp., will be led by Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Lee 
Raymond, who will hold the posts of chairman, chief executive and president of the new company. Mobil 
Chairman and Chief Executive Lucio Noto will serve as vice chairman. 
Although the deal was described as a merger, the terms indicate that Exxon will in fact be acquiring Mobil. Exxon 
shareholders will own 70 percent of the merged entity. The companies said they will retain both brands.

NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Oil industry giants Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. announced Tuesday they 
reached an agreement to merge. At an announced value of $80.1 billion, the deal ranks as the largest corporate 
merger in history. 
A full text of the companies' joint statement follows. 
NEW YORK-(BUSINESS WIRE)-Dec. 1, 1998 - Editor: 
Today Exxon and Mobil announced that they have reached an agreement to merge. A news release regarding 
this agreement follows. Key points in the news release include: 
- Exxon shareholders to own about 70 percent and Mobil 
shareholders to own about 30 percent of the merged company. 
- The merged company will be renamed Exxon Mobil 
Corporation. 
- Both the Exxon and Mobil brands will be retained. 
- L. R. Raymond will be chairman, chief executive 
officer and president of Exxon Mobil. 
- L. A. Noto will be vice chairman of the Exxon Mobil 
Board. The 19-member Exxon Mobil Board will include six 
directors from Mobil. 
- Exxon Mobil will be headquartered in Irving, Texas. 
- Worldwide downstream headquarters for Exxon Mobil will 
be located in Fairfax, Virginia. Worldwide upstream headquarters and worldwide chemical headquarters will be 
located in Houston. 
Exxon and Mobil announced today that they have signed a definitive agreement to merge the two companies. 
Under the terms of the agreement, each share of Mobil will be converted into 1.32015 shares of Exxon. As a 
result of the merger, Mobil shareholders will own about 30 percent of the company, while Exxon shareholders will 
own about 70 percent. 
Upon completion of the merger, the company's name will be Exxon Mobil Corporation, with headquarters in 
Irving, Texas. 
L. R. Raymond will be the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Exxon Mobil Corporation. L. A. 
Noto will join the Exxon Mobil Board of Directors as Vice Chairman.

Page 89 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
E. A. Renna will join the Board as a Senior Vice President and Director. Four additional members of Mobil's 
Board will be invited to join the Exxon Mobil Board as non-employee Directors, bringing Board membership for 
the company to a total of 19 Directors. 
The company will be organised on a functional basis. The Upstream will report to H. J. Longwell, the Downstream 
to Mr. Renna and the Chemical business to R. Dahan. Worldwide downstream headquarters for the company will 
be located in Fairfax, Virginia. Worldwide upstream and chemical headquarters will be in Houston, Texas. Exxon 
Mobil will continue to use both the Exxon brand and the Mobil brand. 
"This merger brings together two outstanding organisations that share common values, have compatible 
strategies and demonstrated track records of achievement," said Mr. Raymond and Mr. Noto in a joint statement. 
"The merger will significantly enhance shareholder value by enabling us to manage the combined assets of Exxon 
and Mobil to produce a higher return on capital employed than either company could achieve on a stand-alone 
basis. 
"The merging of these two companies will deliver significant near-term pre-tax synergies of about $2.8 billion," 
they said. "This merger will enhance our ability to be an effective global competitor in a volatile world economy 
and in an industry that is more and more competitive. It allows us to manage our expanded, combined asset base 
to deliver increasing returns and growth to our shareholders while reducing our operating costs. It also allows us 
to continue delivering quality products to our customers at competitive prices into the future. We are confident that 
with the exceptional quality of Exxon's and Mobil's employees, we will succeed in meeting these objectives." 
They noted that combining Exxon and Mobil will create a major global company, headquartered in the U.S., with 
the technology, the resources and the people to compete effectively with other companies of a similar or larger 
scale in the world oil industry of the 21st Century. "The relative strengths of our two companies are highly 
complementary," they said. "When combined, Exxon Mobil will provide better opportunities for both our 
shareholders and employees than those they would experience without this merger. By combining our operations, 
we also will be better able to meet the needs of our customers for quality products in the next century. It's a good 
match." 
"While we expect to benefit from a reduction of costs in the short-term, our real objective is to maximize growth 
and return on investment by successfully managing the existing assets of Exxon and Mobil and by selecting the 
best projects from the large portfolio of investment options that will be created by this merger," they said. 
"Combining the proprietary technologies and management expertise of the two companies also will reinforce the 
selection of Exxon Mobil as the partner of choice, creating additional resource opportunities in the future." 
In discussing the strategic fit of Exxon and Mobil, Mr. Raymond said the two companies line up well with each 
other in almost every facet of the business. "In the exploration and production area, for example, Mobil's and 
Exxon's respective strengths in West Africa, the Caspian region, Russia, South America, and North America line 
up well, with minimal overlap. Our respective deepwater assets and deepwater technology also complement each 
other well." 
Exxon Mobil will have combined natural gas sales of about 14 billion cubic feet per day, giving the company a 
solid position in this increasingly important worldwide fuel resource. Mobil also brings major LNG assets and 
experience to the combined company that complement Exxon's assets and technology with little overlap. 
Mr. Noto said that in refining and marketing, Exxon and Mobil each have significant global brand recognition, 
expertise and technology. "In the lubricant area, for example, Exxon is an important producer of lube base stocks, 
which fits well with Mobil's leadership in lubes marketing." 
In the U.S., Exxon Mobil will approach the size and scale nationally and regionally of the new downstream joint 
venture companies announced by other major competitors. Outside the U.S., Exxon Mobil will be competitively 
well positioned in key Asian markets and will have complementary positions in South America. The merger also 
builds on Mobil's significant position in Africa. 
"Chemicals are another area where there is a good strategic fit," said Mr. Raymond. "Exxon's chemical product 
line aligns well with Mobil's chemical products. The two companies also share a common focus on efficiency and 
site integration. Exxon Mobil should realise immediate benefits through sharing the proprietary technology and 
best practices of each company." 
Exxon and Mobil also bring important, state-of-the-art proprietary technologies to the venture that will greatly 
benefit the merged company. In exploration and production, this includes leading-edge geoscience technology to

Page 90 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
find and develop oil and gas reserves, arctic technology, and heavy oil technology. In refining, marketing and 
chemicals, this includes catalyst, synthetic lubricant and chemical manufacturing technology. 
The merger is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, as well as other customary conditions. It is 
intended that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization in the United States and that it will be accounted 
for on a "pooling of interests" basis. In addition, the merger agreement provides for payment of termination fees of 
$1.5 billion under certain circumstances. The parties also have entered in an option agreement that grants Exxon 
the option under specified circumstances to purchase up to 14.9 percent of the authorised but unissued common 
stock of Mobil. 
Exxon and Mobil expect to provide details of the proposed merger to their shareholders prior to their annual 
meetings in April and May, respectively. 
Exxon's programme of repurchasing its shares to reduce the number of shares outstanding will be discontinued; 
however, Exxon will continue to repurchase its shares to offset dilution from Employee incentive programmes. 
Exxon was advised on the merger by J.P. Morgan. Mobil was advised by Goldman Sachs.

NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Corp. Chief Executive Lee Raymond told a press conference in New York 
that Exxon and Mobil Corp. would talk to regulators from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission about the merger 
of the two companies this afternoon. 
Raymond said that he would be "amazed" if the FTC did not look closely at the deal, but declined to comment on 
asset disposals. 
He said there was "plenty of scope" for asset sales. 
He also expects the deal to add to earnings after 1999 after $2.0 billion of merger costs in the first year. 
In addition to the U.S. regulators, Raymond said that he expected European regulators would show a great deal 
of interest in the proposed merger. 
Turning to the issue of internal savings, Raymond said that the two companies would cut their 122,700 workforce 
by 9,000 and he expected savings would be $2.8 billion by the end of three years. 
Raymond said that as a result of the merger, Exxon and Mobil would cut their combined capital spending budget 
of some $15 billion by 10 percent in 1999. 
Raymond said the deal to create the world's largest traded oil company in terms of market capitalisation and 
reserves would have been done even if oil prices had been higher. 
Mobil Chief Executive Lucio Noto said that he had looked at other mergers and acquisitions before Exxon, but 
said nothing had come close to delivering the value that the Exxon-Mobil deal could. 
He said that contrary to press speculation about culture differences between the firm, he and Raymond got on 
well. 
Contrary to some speculation, they said that the companies would continue to sell both Exxon and Mobil branded 
gasolines. 
One area of continuing negotiation between the firms includes the future of their Canadian subsidiaries, Mobil 
Canada and Exxon's Imperial Oil Ltd. .

CALGARY, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Chief executives of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. , the U.S. oil titans who 
announced a mammoth merger on Tuesday, have left oil-patch watchers guessing how the marriage will shape 
up in Canada. 
The Canadian affiliates of Irving, Texas-based Exxon and Mobil of Fairfax, Virginia, play dominant roles in most 
parts of the country's energy sector and speculation has been rampant over how they could be put together. 
But at a news conference in New York to give details of $76-billion worldwide deal, Exxon CEO Lee Raymond 
said the fates of his majority-owned affiliate, Imperial Oil Ltd. , and of Mobil Oil Canada had yet to be decided. 
"That's one of those questions that we haven't gotten to yet," Raymond said. "I understand all the interest in 
Canada, but until we have some more time to understand more details about the Mobil operation in Canada, it 
would be premature for me to comment on that." 
Exxon owns 69.6 percent of Toronto-based Imperial, Canada's biggest energy company. Imperial is the No. 1 
seller of gasoline nationwide and a dominant force in oil sands mining, synthetic crude processing and heavy oil 
production. 
Mobil's wholly owned Canadian division, meanwhile, has a commanding presence in the country's burgeoning 
East Coast offshore oil play, where it has major stakes in the Hibernia and Terra Nova oil developments off 
Newfoundland. 
The Exxon and Mobil merger, announced on Tuesday following days of speculation, would create the world's 
biggest oil company and reshape the energy industry. 
The deal, hammered out amid the lowest oil prices in real terms in 25 years, aims to gain total savings of $2.8 
billion. 
Imperial officials on Tuesday declined to speculate how the Exxon-Mobil merger would play out in Canada. 
"Imperial Oil is not a direct party to the agreement," said spokesman Richard O'Farrell. "We're looking at this and 
we'll take some time...we can't speculate on the implications of how the merger might be implemented in 
Canada." 
Canadian analysts have welcomed the potential for Exxon and Mobil to marry Canadian operations, saying the 
new company would dominate the energy landscape and add sizzle to Imperial, known for its ability to generate 
piles of cash from gasoline retailing and oil sands projects like Syncrude Canada Ltd. and its big Cold Lake, 
Alberta, heavy oil play. 
Rather than buying companies for growth, as many of its peers have done, Imperial has for years used its cash to 
pay special dividends to shareholders and buy back its own stock. 
Analysts have suggested it could buy Mobil Canada for upwards of C$4 billion within the context of the larger 
deal. 
Scotia Capital Markets analyst Duncan Mathieson pointed out such a deal would raise few hackles among 
competition regulators because there is little overlap between the two.

Page 95 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"The merger of Imperial Oil and Mobil Canada is a very, very good fit from an asset point of view," Mathieson 
said. 
He said the fate of Canadian operations would likely be made known once the two U.S. oil majors had all other 
approvals to merge in place. Exxon and Mobil said they hoped to complete their merger by mid-1999. 
Imperial, which has about 7,000 employees, produced an average of 293,000 barrels of oil and 350 million cubic 
feet of gas a day during the third quarter. 
Mobil Canada employs 950 and produces an average of 95,000 barrels of oil and 500 million cubic feet of gas a 
day. 
Imperial shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange closed up C$0.35 to C$28 on Tuesday.

NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Corp. said Tuesday it agreed to acquire Mobil Corp. for a record $76.2 
billion in a stock transaction that will create the world's largest oil company and reshape the industry. 
The marriage of two of the world's biggest oil companies, which is expected to result in 9,000 job cuts, comes 
amid a wave of combinations in the industry, which is battling the lowest oil prices in 25 years and high costs for 
exploration, production and refining. 
While the deal reunites two of the seven sisters orphaned by the 1911 breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard 
Oil empire, analysts did not expect any big anti-competitive issues to be raised in the United States because 
gasoline prices are at their cheapest levels on record and competition is intense. 
The new company, to be called Exxon Mobil Corp., will be the world's largest publicly traded company in terms of 
revenue, surpassing General Motors Corp. 
Exxon expects to cut 9,000 jobs, or 7 percent of its workforce, according to an industry analyst who was briefed 
by the company at a meeting. 
The merger is the biggest in U.S. corporate history, topping the $72.6 billion paid this year by Travelers Group for 
Citicorp. It brings together companies with combined 1997 net income of $11.8 billion and revenue of $203 billion. 
The deal, which calls for shares of Mobil to be swapped for 1.32015 shares of Exxon, values Mobil at $94.23 a 
share, or $76.2 billion, based on Tuesday's share prices and 808.4 million Mobil shares outstanding. 
The merged company will be led by Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Lee Raymond, who will hold the posts 
of chairman, chief executive and president. Mobil Chairman and Chief Executive Lucio Noto will serve as vice 
chairman of the board. 
Both well-known brands will be retained after the deal. 
The company will be based in Exxon's hometown of Irving, Texas. Worldwide refining and marketing operations 
are to be located in Fairfax, Va., where Mobil is now based. 
Worldwide headquarters for exploration and production and chemical operations will be based in Houston. 
The companies estimated the transaction will generate pre-tax savings of $2.8 billion on a "near-term" basis. An 
Exxon official told analysts that one-third of the saving would come in the first year, according to an analyst who 
asked not to be identified. 
Exxon said the deal would be neutral to earnings in the first year and then add to profits after that. The deal is 
expected to close in the middle of next year. 
"This merger will enhance our ability to be an effective global competitor in a volatile world economy and in an 
industry that is more and more competitive," the companies said in a press release. 
The combined company will have 20.743 billion barrels of oil and gas reserves, 1.631 million barrels per day of oil 
and gas production and 6.66 million barrels of refining capacity.

Page 97 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
It will also have greater access to North Sea oil fields, potential lucrative deals with oil kingpin Saudi Arabia, and a 
stronger presence in the U.S. refining and marketing arena, analysts have said. 
Saudi Arabia, which has the biggest oil reserves in the world, recently announced it was talking to Western 
companies about opening up its closed oil and natural gas sectors. 
Mobil's liquefied natural gas expertise, combined with Exxon's patent processes for transforming natural gas into 
more valuable and tradable oil, makes the two companies the top of any wish-list for the Saudis, analysts say. 
But most industry experts said there will be cultural challenges in bringing the two companies together. Exxon is 
known as conservative and rigid, while Mobil has pursued innovative programmes to cut costs and improve 
productivity. 
The pact, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to be closely scrutinised by U.S. regulators, 
although Exxon and Mobil said they did not expect any big antitrust problems, especially in light of other big 
mergers and joint ventures in the industry. 
"In the U.S., Exxon Mobil will approach the size and scale nationally and regionally of the new downstream joint 
venture companies announced by other major competitors," the companies said. 
The Exxon-Mobil combination was the biggest of two large mergers in the oil industry Tuesday. 
Earlier, France's Total SA announced plans to buy PetroFina of Belgium, creating the world's sixth largest oil 
company with a combined market capitalisation of $39 billion. Also, British Petroleum Co Plc. recently announced 
plans to buy Amoco Corp. for more than $50 billion.

(c) 1998 Reuters Limited 
NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - In his four-year tenure as head of Mobil Corp. , Lucio Noto consistently surprised 
Wall Street with an aggressive hand that transformed the slumbering oil giant into one of the industry's leanest 
companies. 
Now the Brooklyn native, well-regarded for his charismatic, innovative and fiercely determined style, will be taking 
a back seat to Exxon Corp.'s Lee Raymond, a no-nonsense executive who shuns publicity and has little patience 
for failure. 
Not everyone is convinced it is a match made in heaven. 
Exxon, the nation's largest oil company, on Tuesday announced plans to buy Mobil, its rival and the second 
largest. Originally worth $80.1 billion when announced, the value of the transaction fell to about $76.5 billion due 
to a decline in Exxon's stock price. 
The deal calls for Raymond to hold the top positions as chairman, chief executive and president. Noto, who is 
now chairman and chief executive of Mobil, would hold the role of vice chairman at the new company. 
The merged entity, to be called Exxon Mobil Corp., would have 19 board members, six of whom would come 
from Mobil. Exxon shareholders would own 70 percent of the combined company. 
Industry veterans are puzzled by Noto's willingness to take on a seemingly-minor position at what would be the 
world's largest oil company. 
"He's very bright, very aggressive and very energetic. Given his energy level and his presence, I have trouble 
seeing him in a secondary role," said Fred Leuffer of Bear Stearns. 
Most industry experts expect Noto to stay on with Exxon for a while and then perhaps leave the company to serve 
as a global energy consultant. 
"He's 60, but he's a very young 60. I just can't see him retiring and sitting home," said an energy industry 
investment banker who did not want to be identified. 
In announcing the deal, the companies did not outline a role for Noto and industry experts said the lack of detail 
about his position provided further indication that Raymond would be running the show. 
"Noto will be marginalized. I think it's going to be incredibly frustrating for him," the banker said. 
Furthermore, industry experts said Noto, known for his sense of humour and love of cars, would have difficulty 
fitting into Exxon's corporate culture. 
"There is an arrogance to Exxon's attitude. It is a culture of control. Mistakes are not tolerated. There is very little 
leeway for individual flamboyance," said one industry expert who did not want to be identified. 
"At Mobil, there's a surprising degree of humility. There is a degree of introspection and a willingness to 
recognise people's faults and weaknesses. Noto's attitude is 'If it's broken, fix it and don't get hung up on the 
reasons why it broke,'" the expert added.

Page 99 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Noto took over as chairman and chief executive of Mobil in 1994 upon the retirement of longtime leader Allen 
Murray. 
A 36-year Mobil veteran, Noto joined the company as a member of its regional planning analysis group in 1962 
and later worked for the oil firm in Italy and Japan. 
But it was Saudi Arabia where he rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, forming close ties with members of 
the royal family members who oversee the world's largest oil reserves. As president of Mobil Saudi Arabia Inc., 
Noto lived in Jeddah and later directed Mobil's Saudi Arabian refining and marketing and petrochemical 
operations from New York. 
Since taking over the helm of Mobil, Noto has led the way in a wave of industry restructurings. Just three months 
after he took over the top job, Noto announced plans to overhaul the company's chemical operations by slashing 
the workforce by 20 percent and reducing production capacity. 
Over the next several years, Noto continued to slash costs at the company. 
But it soon became clear that slimming down the company would not be enough for Mobil, and the company 
started searching for a partner. In a forerunner of a handful of deals to sweep the industry, Mobil joined its 
European oil refining and marketing business with British Petroleum Co. Plc in 1996. 
But the courting process also has been difficult for Noto and Mobil. The company pursued a variety of potential 
partners and came close to a refining and marketing alliance with Amoco Corp.. but those talks fell apart. Other 
rumoured partners were Atlantic Richfield Co., Chevron Corp. and Conoco Inc . 
Industry insiders have attributed part of those failures to Noto's unwillingness to share the top spot at a merged 
entity. 
But in the case of Exxon, Noto likely did not have much of a choice. Most industry experts think that Exxon 
approached Mobil about a transaction and Noto, knowing that the nation's largest company had deep pockets, 
was forced to think about his investors rather than his career. 
"He created an enormous amount of value for his shareholders," said the investment banker.

NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Corp.'s record deal to buy Mobil Corp. will allow two of the world's largest 
companies to weather the worst oil prices in a quarter of a century and position them at the head of the pack for 
any recovery. 
While the deal reunites two of the seven sisters orphaned by the 1911 breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard 
Oil Trust, analysts do not expect any big anti-competitive issues to be raised in the United States because 
gasoline prices are at their cheapest levels on record and competition is intense. 
The merger is not only the biggest deal in history but it fundamentally recreates the oil map: it puts together a 
powerhouse that has more in common with the biggest oil producing nations in the world, such as Saudi Arabia 
and Venezuela, than other oil and gas companies. 
It creates the world's largest publicly traded company in terms of revenue and will have a combined workforce of 
about 122,700 before any job cuts. 
"These two companies are rearranging the seats around the table of the biggest game in town. They are prepared 
for $12 oil, they are looking beyond that," said Fadel Gheit, analyst at Fahnestock & Co. 
In a reference to the "great game", the 19th century battle between Britain and Russia for control of India, 
analysts said that Exxon Mobil Corp., as the new company will be called, would be the clear winner in any battle 
for control of the world's oil reserves. 
It brings together two companies with combined net income in 1997 of $11.8 billion and revenue of $203 billion. 
In its announcement, Exxon said it would pay $80.1 billion for Mobil, based on Monday's stock price, using its 
own stock. The two companies confirmed last Friday they were in talks. 
Mobil shareholders will receive 1.32015 Exxon shares for each Mobil share they hold and analysts said they 
expect the deal to add five percent to Exxon earnings in the first year of operations. 
On the New York Stock Exchange, Mobil stock closed down $2.44 at $83.75 and Exxon shares finished $3.31 
lower at $71.75. Based on Exxon's closing stock price, the deal is valued at $76.6 billion. 
"Two and two could make five. There are not many acquisitions which could have had that impact for Exxon," 
said Eugene Nowak, analyst at ABN AMRO Inc. 
Gheit at Fahnestock expects the two companies will clear U.S. regulatory hurdles with ease, but said European 
antitrust authorities would probably want to take a look at the impact of the deal on its gasoline sales market. 
"This will be a company with a market capitalisation of $260 billion. It can afford to throw the regulators a crumb of 
say $5.0 billion," in asset sales or divestments, he said. 
In what analysts said was a clear reference to U.S. regulators and to a joint venture between Royal Dutch/Shell 
Group, Texaco Inc. and Saudi Aramco, as well as British Petroleum Co. Plc's pending acquisition of Amoco 
Corp., Exxon and Mobil said they do not expect any big antitrust problems. 
"In the U.S., Exxon Mobil will approach the size and scale nationally and regionally of the new downstream joint 
venture companies announced by other major competitors," the companies said.

The sheer size of the behemoth created by the merger of the biggest publicly traded oil company in the world and 
Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company and No. 4 in the world, is enough to awe anyone, analysts said. 
It also brings together two companies with the ability to win projects in arenas that others can only dream of. 
According to Western oil companies, Saudi Arabia, which has the biggest oil reserves in the world, has asked 
foreign companies about opening up its closed oil and natural gas sectors. 
Mobil's liquefied natural gas expertise combined with Exxon's patent processes for transforming natural gas into 
more valuable and tradable oil makes the two companies the top of any wish-list for the Saudis, analysts say. 
"These two companies have assembled an all-star team, the two chief executives, Lee Raymond of Exxon and 
Lucio Noto of Mobil have crowned their careers with the biggest play ever," said Gheit. 
Raymond will be President and Chief Executive of the new company and Noto will be Vice Chairman.

Mobil's Noto to have smaller Exxon role.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - In his four-year tenure as head of Mobil Corp., Lucio Noto consistently surprised Wall 
Street with an aggressive hand that transformed the slumbering oil giant into one of the industry's leanest 
companies. 
Now the Brooklyn native, well-regarded for his charismatic, innovative and fiercely determined style, will be taking 
a back seat to Exxon Corp.'s Lee Raymond, a no-nonsense executive who shuns publicity and has little patience 
for failure. 
Not everyone is convinced it is a match made in heaven. 
Exxon, the nation's largest oil company, on Tuesday announced plans to buy Mobil, its rival and the second 
largest in a stock deal worth $76.2 billion. 
The deal calls for Raymond to hold the top positions as chairman, chief executive and president. Noto, who is 
now chairman and chief executive of Mobil, would hold the role of vice chairman at the new company. 
Industry veterans are puzzled by Noto's willingness to take on a seemingly-minor position at what would be the 
world's largest oil company. 
"He's very bright, very aggressive and very energetic. Given his energy level and his presence, I have trouble 
seeing him in a secondary role," said Fred Leuffer of Bear Stearns. 
Most industry experts expect Noto to stay on with Exxon for a while and then perhaps leave the company to serve 
as a global energy consultant. 
"He's 60, but he's a very young 60. I just can't see him retiring and sitting home," said an energy industry 
investment banker who did not want to be identified. 
In announcing the deal, the companies did not outline a role for Noto and industry experts said the lack of detail 
about his position provided further indication that Raymond would be running the show. 
"Noto will be marginalized. I think it's going to be incredibly frustrating for him," the banker said. 
Furthermore, industry experts said Noto, known for his sense of humour and love of cars, would have difficulty 
fitting into Exxon's corporate culture. 
"There is an arrogance to Exxon's attitude. It is a culture of control. Mistakes are not tolerated. There is very little 
leeway for individual flamboyance," said one industry expert who did not want to be identified. 
"At Mobil, there's a surprising degree of humility. There is a degree of introspection and a willingness to 
recognise people's faults and weaknesses. Noto's attitude is 'If it's broken, fix it and don't get hung up on the 
reasons why it broke,'" the expert added. 
Noto took over as chairman and chief executive of Mobil in 1994 upon the retirement of longtime leader Allen 
Murray. 
A 36-year Mobil veteran, Noto joined the company as a member of its regional planning analysis group in 1962 
and later worked for the oil firm in Italy and Japan.

Page 103 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
He rose to prominence in Saudi Arabia in the 1970s and 1980s, forming close ties with members of the royal 
family who oversee the world's largest oil reserves. As president of Mobil Saudi Arabia Inc., Noto lived in Jeddah 
and later directed Mobil's Saudi Arabian refining and marketing and petrochemical operations from New York. 
Since taking over the helm of Mobil, Noto has led the way in a wave of industry restructurings. Just three months 
after he took over the top job, Noto announced plans to overhaul the company's chemical operations by slashing 
the workforce by 20 percent and reducing production capacity. 
Over the next several years, Noto continued to slash costs at the company. 
But it soon became clear that slimming down the company would not be enough for Mobil, and the company 
started searching for a partner. In a forerunner of a handful of deals to sweep the industry, Mobil joined its 
European oil refining and marketing business with British Petroleum Co. Plc in 1996. 
But the courting process also has been difficult for Noto and Mobil. The company pursued a variety of potential 
partners and came close to a refining and marketing alliance with Amoco Corp., but those talks fell apart. Other 
rumoured partners were Atlantic Richfield Co., Chevron Corp. and Conoco Inc. 
Industry insiders have attributed part of those failures to Noto's unwillingness to share the top spot at a merged 
entity. 
But in the case of Exxon, Noto likely did not have much of a choice. Most industry experts think that Exxon 
approached Mobil about a transaction and Noto, knowing that the nation's largest company had deep pockets, 
was forced to think about his investors rather than his career. 
"He created an enormous amount of value for his shareholders," said the investment banker.

NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Corp. said Tuesday it agreed to acquire Mobil Corp. for a record $80.1 
billion in a stock transaction that will create the world's largest oil company and reshape the oil industry. 
The transaction comes amid a wave of corporate combinations in the oil industry, which is battling the lowest oil 
prices in 25 years and high costs of doing business. 
The announcement came four days after the two oil giants confirmed they were in discussions. Exxon is the 
biggest U.S. oil company and Mobil is the second largest. Exxon shareholders will own 70 percent of the 
combined entity. 
The transaction would be the biggest U.S. corporate combination in history, topping the $72.6 billion paid earlier 
this year by Travelers Group for Citicorp. 
The merged company, to be called Exxon Mobil Corp., will be led by Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Lee 
Raymond, who will hold the posts of chairman, chief executive and president of the new company. Mobil 
Chairman and Chief Executive Lucio Noto will serve as vice chairman of the board. 
Both well-known brands will be retained after the deal. 
The merged company will be based in Exxon's hometown of Irving, Texas. Worldwide refining and marketing 
operations are to be located in Fairfax, Va., where Mobil is now based. 
Worldwide headquarters for exploration and production will be based in Houston. Global chemical operations also 
will be located there. 
The deal is worth $99.09 per Mobil share, based on Monday's closing stock prices. Terms of the definitive 
agreement call for each share of Mobil to be exchanged for 1.32015 shares of Exxon. 
The companies estimated the transaction will generate pre-tax savings of $2.8 billion on a "near-term" basis. It did 
not project a more specific timeframe. 
The announcement did not address the issue of job losses, but a source told Reuters that some 12,000 positions 
could be cut as the companies combine operations. 
"This merger will enhance our ability to be an effective global competitor in a volatile world economy and in an 
industry that is more and more competitive. It allows us to manage our expanded, combined asset base to deliver 
increasing returns and growth to our shareholders while reducing our operating costs," the companies said in a 
press release. 
The pact is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and is expected to be closely scrutinised by U.S. 
regulators. 
It also includes a termination fee of $1.5 billion under certain circumstances, which were not explained by the 
companies. 
The companies also said the deal is expected to be a tax-free transaction and to be accounted for as a pooling of 
interests. Exxon and Mobil said they expect to provide details of the proposed merger to shareholders prior to 
their annual meetings in April and May, respectively.

The Exxon-Mobil combination was the biggest of two large mergers in the oil industry Tuesday. 
Earlier, France's Total SA announced plans to buy PetroFina of Belgium, creating the world's sixth largest oil 
company with a combined market capitalisation of $39 billion. Also, British Petroleum Co Plc. recently announced 
plans to buy Amoco Corp. for more than $50 billion. 
Exxon and Mobil were slated to hold a press conference Tuesday afternoon in New York following a separate 
meeting with Wall Street analysts. 
The companies also said they have entered into an agreement that grants Exxon the option under specified 
circumstances to purchase up to 14.9 percent of the authorised but unissued common stock of Mobil. Those 
circumstances were not explained. 
As part of the deal, Exxon said it will discontinue its share repurchase programme. 
Exxon was advised on the merger by J.P. Morgan. Mobil was advised by Goldman Sachs.

NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Corp. said on Tuesday it agreed to acquire Mobil Corp. for a record $76.2 
billion in a stock transaction that will create the world's largest oil company and reshape the industry. 
The merger comes amid a wave of corporate combinations in the industry, which is battling the lowest oil prices in 
25 years and high costs for exploration, production and refining. 
The announcement came four days after the two oil giants confirmed they were in discussions. Exxon is the 
biggest U.S. oil company and Mobil is the second largest. Exxon shareholders will own 70 percent of the 
combined entity. The deal would reassemble much of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire, which was 
broken up by the government in 1911. 
The transaction would be the biggest U.S. corporate combination in history, topping the $72.6 billion paid earlier 
this year by Travelers Group for Citicorp. The combined company also would rival General Motors Corp. as the 
largest corporation in the world. 
When the deal, which calls for shares of Mobil to be swapped for 1.32015 shares of Exxon, was struck late 
Monday it was worth about $80 billion, based on Monday's stock prices. But Exxon's shares fell $3.69 to $71.375 
Tuesday morning, reducing the total to $76.2 billion. 
Based on Mobil's 808.4 million shares outstanding, the agreement values Mobil at $94.23 per share. The stock 
was trading at $85.75, down 44 cents, in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Exxon is 
also traded. 
The merged company, to be called Exxon Mobil Corp., will be led by Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Lee 
Raymond, who will hold the posts of chairman, chief executive and president of the new company. Mobil 
Chairman and Chief Executive Lucio Noto will serve as vice chairman of the board.

shareholders while reducing our operating costs."

The combined company will have 20.743 billion barrels of oil and gas reserves, 1.631 million barrels per day of oil 
and gas production and 6.66 million barrels of refining capacity. 
It will also have greater access to North Sea oil fields, potential lucrative deals with oil kingpin Saudi Arabia, and a 
stronger presence in the U.S. refining and marketing arena, analysts have said. 
But most industry experts said that there will be cultural challenges in bringing the two companies together. Exxon 
is known as an extremely conservative and rigid company, while Mobil has pursued innovative programmes to 
cut costs and improve productivity. 
The pact is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and is expected to be closely scrutinised by U.S. 
regulators. 
It also includes a termination fee of $1.5 billion under certain circumstances, which were not explained by the

NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Corp., the biggest U.S. oil company, has reached an agreement to buy 
No. 2 rival Mobil Corp. for $80 billion or more in stock, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. 
The deal, which could be worth as much as nearly $85 billion and is expected to be announced on Tuesday, 
values Mobil shares at between $97 and $105 each, the source said. Exxon is expected to exchange 1.3 to 1.4 
shares of its shares for each of Mobil's 808.4 million outstanding shares. 
It was not immediately clear if the boards of both companies had voted on the transaction. But directors at both 
companies were expected to approve the deal. 
The deal calls for Exxon shareholders to own about 70 percent of the combined company, said the source, who 
did not want to be identified. 
Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Lee Raymond will retain management control over the merged companies, 
the source said. Mobil Chairman and Chief Executive Lucio Noto is expected to have a role at the combined 
company, but his exact title could not immediately be determined. 
The deal comes just a few days after the companies confirmed they were in discussions that could lead to the 
biggest-ever corporate marriage, topping the $72.6 billion paid earlier this year by Travelers Group in its 
acquisition of Citicorp.

"I have no comment," Raymond said speaking from the St. Regis Hotel in New York. 
On Wednesday, sources said the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. oil companies were in talks to create the world's largest oil

A merger between the two oil and gas giants could value Mobil as high as $80 billion making the deal the world's

WASHINGTON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Corp.'s record $76.6 billion bid to buy Mobil Corp. to create the world's 
biggest oil company now faces the scrutiny of federal regulators. 
The Federal Trade Commission is likely to review the Exxon-Mobil combination, instead of the Justice 
Department, because the FTC has expertise in oil mergers, according to antitrust lawyers. 
If completed, the Exxon-Mobil transaction would be the biggest corporate merger ever. 
Lee Raymond, Exxon's chairman and chief executive officer, said representatives for both companies would 
meet with FTC officials Tuesday afternoon about the merger. 
When asked at a televised news conference when the merger application will be formally filed with the FTC, 
Raymond replied, "As soon as we can." 
After the merger document is given to the FTC, the agency will then have 30 calendar days to review the deal for 
antitrust violations. 
During that review period, the agency may ask the companies for additional information. Such second requests 
occur in only about 5 percent of mergers, an FTC spokeswoman said. 
"It's unusual, but it doesn't automatically signal...this deal is dead," she said. 
For example, the FTC has made a second request for more information on the pending merger of British 
Petroleum Co. Plc and Chicago-based Amoco Corp. . 
Exxon and Mobil could take as long as they need to submit the additional information requested by the agency. 
"So let's say they file with us (initially), and we come back to them on Day 28, and say 'Hey, we need more 
documents.' They can take a day, they can take a month...," the spokeswoman said, adding that the bigger the 
companies and the more regional offices and assets they have scattered throughout the country, the longer it 
could take them to supply the FTC with the requested information. 
"The act of compliance may take them weeks," the FTC spokeswoman said. 
Once Exxon, Mobil and the FTC have certified that all the additional requested merger information has been 
submitted, the FTC will have 20 more days to review the data. 
However, the FTC spokeswoman said that in "very complicated" mergers, the FTC may ask for more time to 
study the deal. "Ordinarily the companies give us that time," she said. "They cooperate with us to finish the 
review." 
The deal values Mobil at $94.72 a share, or about $76.6 billion, based on the closing price of Exxon's stock and 
808.4 million Mobil shares outstanding. The transaction calls for shares of Mobil to be swapped for 1.32015 
shares of Exxon. 
On Tuesday, Exxon's stock fell $3.375 to $71.625 and Mobil's shares dropped $2.25 to $83.75.

Page 111 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Exxon and Mobil said they plan to send merger information to their shareholders during the first quarter of next 
year and hope to finalise the deal in mid-1999. 
However, that goal could take longer if the chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust 
subcommittee gets his way. 
Sen. Mike DeWine, Republican of Ohio, on Tuesday sent a letter to FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky, asking him to 
delay a final decision on the pending BP-Amoco merger until the effects of that deal and the Exxon-Mobil merger 
on overall competition in the oil industry and gasoline prices for consumers can be taken into account together. 
That letter was co-signed by the ranking Democrat on DeWine's antitrust panel, Sen. Herb Kohl, Democrat of 
Wisconsin. 
DeWine said he didn't know if his panel will hold hearings on the Exxon-Mobil merger, as it did on the BP-Amoco 
transaction in September. 
Jobs from BP's U.S. headquarters in Cleveland in DeWine's home state of Ohio are expected to be transferred to 
Amoco's corporate headquarters in Chicago, as a result of the merger. BP and Amoco officials have said they 
hope to finalise the merger by Dec. 31. 
"It is worrisome," DeWine said, referring to the Exxon-Mobil deal. "It's a concern. It has to be looked at very 
carefully. This is going to make a super company." 
Antitrust lawyers speculated that the FTC would require Exxon and Mobil to sell some of their gasoline stations in 
overlapping local markets where they account for a large amount of retail fuel sales. 
Exxon's Chairman and CEO Raymond said he would be "amazed" if the FTC did not make both companies sell 
some of their assets in order for the merger to be approved. But he declined to specify which properties would 
likely be shed. 
"That's really the FTC's job. That's not my job," he said. 
In some eastern states, the companies account for more than 30 percent of gasoline sales. Because of that 
concentration, states will fight the merger, antitrust lawyers said. 
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal announced on Tuesday he would investigate and help lead a 
multi-state inquiry into the proposed Exxon-Mobil merger to ensure the deal does not stifle competition and cause 
gasoline prices to rise.

SIGN MERGER AGREEMENT VALUED AT $77.2 BILLION 
New York-Dec. 1-FWN-MOBIL CORPORATION AND Exxon Corporation announced today that they have signed 
a definitive agreement to merge the two companies. The deal is reportedly valued at $77.2 billion and creates the 
world's largest oil company. 
Under the terms of the agreement, each share of Mobil will be converted into 1.32015 shares of Exxon. As a 
result of the merger, Mobil shareholders will own about 30% of the company, while Exxon shareholders will own 
about 70%. 
Upon completion of the merger, the company's name will be Exxon Mobil Corporation, with headquarters in 
Irving, Texas. 
L. R. Raymond will be the chairman, chief executive officer and president of Exxon Mobil Corporation. L. A. Noto 
will join the Exxon Mobil Board of Directors as vice chairman. 
E. A. Renna will join the Board as a senior vice president and director. Four additional members of Mobil's Board 
will be invited to join the Exxon Mobil Board as non-employee directors, bringing Board membership for the 
company to a total of 19 directors. 
The company will be organized on a functional basis. The Upstream will report to H. J. Longwell, the Downstream 
to Renna and the Chemical business to R. Dahan. Worldwide downstream headquarters for the company will be 
located in Fairfax, Va. Worldwide upstream and chemical headquarters will be in Houston, Texas. Exxon Mobil 
will continue to use both the Exxon brand and the Mobil brand. 
"This merger brings together two outstanding organizations that share common values, have compatible 
strategies and demonstrated track records of achievement," said Raymond and Noto in a joint statement. "The 
merger will significantly enhance shareholder value by enabling us to manage the combined assets of Exxon and 
Mobil to produce a higher return on capital employed than either company could achieve on a stand-alone basis. 
"The merging of these two companies will deliver significant near-term pre-tax synergies of about $2.8 billion," 
they said. "This merger will enhance our ability to be an effective global competitor in a volatile world economy 
and in an industry that is more and more competitive. It allows us to manage our expanded, combined asset base 
to deliver increasing returns and growth to our shareholders while reducing our operating costs. It also allows us 
to continue delivering quality products to our customers at competitive prices into the future. We are confident that 
with the exceptional quality of Exxon's and Mobil's employees, we will succeed in meeting these objectives."

Oil, the stuff that drives the world, the price of it and who controls it, those are the big stories tonight. Big oil just 
got a lot bigger, and a lot of people will lose their jobs. But if it all works out as planned, a lot of shareholders will 
realize some very tidy gains. Mobil and Exxon, two of the giants, agreed to a merger forming a company so large 
that hundreds of millions of dollars would be considered loose change. We begin tonight with NBC's Mike Jensen. 
MIKE JENSEN reporting: 
America's largest oil company, sales of $137 billion a year, swallowing up the nation's second largest, sales of 
$66 billion a year. 
Mr. LEE RAYMOND (Exxon Chairman): The new company will be known as Exxon/Mobil and will retain both 
strong brands. 
JENSEN: Exxon and Mobil combined pumping two and a half million barrels of oil a day, more than Kuwait, 
almost as much as Iran. Profits last year above billion dollars a month. The merged companies say they'll cut 
costs to keep profits up because the prices they charge for their products have plummeted, crude oil prices to 
12-year lows, gasoline prices to their lowest levels ever when inflation is taken into account. The quickest way to 
cut costs, get rid of workers. Exxon has 80,000 employees, Mobil almost 43,000. How many will lose their jobs? 
Mr. RAYMOND: We would estimate there'd be about 9,000 people that in one way or another would be redundant 
to the organization. 
JENSEN: Some of the cuts at Exxon and Mobil refineries in Louisiana, Texas, and California for example. 
Mr. JIMMY HERRINGTON (President Local 4-243 OCAW Union): It's inevitable that job reductions are going to 
occur. It's inevitable. 
JENSEN: Analysts say before the merger is permitted, it will be scrutinized by the government to be sure it won't 
reduce competition. Regulators don't want the smaller oil companies that buy from Exxon and Mobil refineries to 
be hurt. There's also concern about how drivers will be affected. Exxon and Mobil now compete for customers, 
and state regulators want assurance that if both gas stations are owned by the same company, pump prices won't 
go up. 
If the merger is allowed, and most analysts think it will be, it will bring together two of the biggest pieces of the 
legendary Standard Oil monopoly of John D. Rockefeller, broken up by the government in 1911. Analysts say in 
this era of giant international powerhouses, American companies have to be big to survive, that mergers like this 
one are inevitable unless regulators find that consumers are paying the price. Mike Jensen, NBC News, New 
York.

NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - A union of Exxon Corp. 
and Mobil Corp. is expected to result in some $3 billion 
of cost savings, including job cuts of about 10 percent, 
according to a source familiar with negotiations between the two 
oil giants. 
The details mean that some 12,000 jobs would be eliminated 
under the record-setting transaction that is expected to be 
announced Tuesday. The companies have a combined workforce of 
about 122,000. 
Representatives of both companies were still negotiating 
terms of the deal on Sunday, but had essentially agreed on the 
estimated cost savings and job reductions that would come from 
the combination, said the source who did not want to be 
identified. 
Mobil and Exxon officials declined to comment. 
On Friday, the companies confirmed that they were in talks 
about a corporate combination, but warned there were no 
assurances an agreement would be reached. 
Although the two companies are likely to describe the 
transaction as a merger, takeover experts say the deal actually 
would be an acquisition of Mobil by Exxon, which would be the 
surviving entity. Mobil shareholders are expected to receive 
Exxon stock in the deal and Exxon is expected to assume Mobil's 
$7 billion debt load. 
Negotiations between the two companies continued over the

weekend, focusing on the value of the anticipated transaction 
and roles for top executives. The deal is expected to be a stock 
transaction, although some Wall Street analysts have speculated 
that a cash component also may be involved. 
Meanwhile, Exxon executives, including chief executive Lee 
Raymond, were slated to fly into New York on Monday. Exxon is 
based in Irving, Texas. 
The travel plans of Mobil executives could not immediately 
be determined. Mobil is based in Fairfax, Va. 
A union of the two companies would be the biggest-ever 
industrial merger, topping British Petroleum's planned $53 
billion acquisition of Amoco Corp. and DaimlerBenz's 
recently-completed $42 billion purchase billion of Chrysler 
Corp. 
Based on Friday's stock activity, when shares rallied on the 
confirmation, Mobil's market capitalization is about $69 
billion. 
It would also be the latest transaction in the consolidating 
oil industry, which has been hurt badly by weak oil prices and 
the high costs of exploration and production. 
Mobil is being represented in the deal by Goldman Sachs.

NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - With oil prices tumbling to 25-year lows on Monday, Exxon Corp. edged closer to 
buying Mobil Corp. for as much as $80 billion as the two oil giants ironed out the final details of what would be 
the world's largest industrial merger ever, analysts said. 
With its Chairman Lee Raymond arriving in New York on Monday, Irving, Texas-based Exxon is expected to buy 
Mobil for as much as $100 a share in stock, in what would be the industry's second blockbuster deal this year, 
they said. 
An announcement is expected Tuesday with final terms focusing on the price tag for Mobil and roles for top 
executives at the combined entity. Analysts said the deal could be structured to help Exxon's earnings in 1999. 
The travel plans of Fairfax, Va.-based Mobil executives could not be determined. 
Exxon is the largest publicly traded oil company in the world in terms of market capitalisation. Mobil is the nation's 
second-largest oil company and world's fourth-biggest. 
Bucking a sharp drop in the broader market and in other leading oil companies, Mobil and Exxon shares closed 
higher and were among the most active on the New York Stock Exchange. The 25-year low in world oil prices is 
adjusted for inflation. 
Mobil stock hit a record high of $87.50 but trimmed its gains to close at $86.19, up 69 cents, on volume of 8.3 
million shares - nearly four times its average daily volume. The gain came on top of its rise of $7.125 on Friday 
after the two companies confirmed they were in talks about a possible deal. 
Based on Monday's closing price and its 808.4 million shares outstanding, Mobil is valued at about $69.7 billion. 
But analysts said Exxon may pay as much as $100 per share in order to get full management control and 
complete the deal. That is a 30 percent to 40 percent premium to Mobil's stock price prior to last week when talk 
of the deal first surfaced. 
Based on $100 per share, or just over $80 billion, the deal would eclipse insurer Travelers Group's purchase of 
Citicorp for $72.6 billion to form Citigroup . 
After spiking up to a record intraday high of $77.31 on Friday, Exxon stock finished 69 cents higher at $75.06. 
The deal follows British Petroleum Co. Plc's pending acquisition of Chicago-based Amoco Corp. and reinforces 
the need for oil companies to consolidate in order to survive, with oil prices trading at less than $12 per barrel. 
The big three oil companies would be headed by a merged Exxon-Mobil and would include Anglo-Dutch oil giant 
Royal Dutch/Shell Group and British Petroleum/Amoco. 
Exxon may even have to sweeten the pot to buy Mobil. 
"I think Exxon would probably have to sweeten the deal with some cash, but Exxon stock is an extremely good 
currency for Mobil shareholders to hold," said Fahnestcok & Co. analyst Fadel Gheit.

Page 118 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
With the deal, which would also make it the world's largest publicly traded oil company in terms of reserves, 
Exxon gains greater access to North Sea oil fields, potential lucrative deals with OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia, and 
a stronger presence in the U.S. refining and marketing arena, analysts said. 
Exxon would also get $3 billion of cost cuts, according to sources familiar with the talks. 
But Exxon, already the largest in terms of market capitalisation, will have to prove bigger is better in an industry 
fighting the weakest oil price in 25 years. 
"The fact that two well-managed companies such as Exxon and Mobil are even having these discussions 
demonstrates the industry's determination to further cut costs in a period of weak oil prices," Schroder & Co. 
analyst Michael Mayer said. 
Exxon and Mobil declined to comment beyond their statement on Friday when they warned an agreement is not 
guaranteed. 
A merged Exxon-Mobil would have 20.743 billion barrels of oil and gas reserves, 1.631 million barrels per day of 
oil and gas production and 6.66 million barrels of refining capacity. 
Analysts expect the merger to face few regulatory hurdles in the United States but greater scrutiny in Europe 
because Mobil already has a large refining venture with BP. 
Gheit discounted talk that the discussions could fail at this late stage or that the two companies will merely 
announce a merger of their refining and marketing operations. Anything short of a full merger would be a failure 
for Mobil. 
Looking at the cost savings, Mayer said that an exchange under which Mobil shareholders received more than 
1.33 Exxon shares for each Mobil share would effectively give up all of the benefits from the merger to Mobil. 
Fred Leuffer, oil analyst at Bear Stearns, said in a report that an all-stock deal at $100 per share would put a 
value of $8 per barrel of proven and probable reserves for Mobil, well above the industry's finding and 
development costs. 
"Although acquiring Mobil on these bases hardly seems like a bargain, our 1999 projections indicate the 
transaction would be accretive to Exxon's earnings and cash flow," he said. 
But Leuffer cautioned that apart from a one time boost to earnings per share of 30 cents in 1999, around 10 
percent, the merger would not significantly improve Exxon's growth rate. 
"Bigger, by itself, is not better. If you question this, just ask the management of Royal Dutch, where size has not 
helped the company's competitiveness," he said. 
Mobil does bring something to Exxon: a greater North Sea presence, access to the giant 6.0 billion to 8.0 billion 
barrel Tengiz oil field in the Caspian, heavy oil projects in California, Canada and Venezuela, and a strong 
position in Nigeria. 
It also restores Exxon as the leader in market share in U.S. refining and in gasoline sales. 
Fahnestock's Gheit said that one key area that Exxon will be looking at is Saudi Arabia, which recently called for 
proposals from oil companies on liberalising its oil sector. 
"Mobil (CEO) Lucio Noto ahs the closest contacts of all the foreign oil companies with the Saudis. He can help 
bring in the deals which a merged, bigger company can exploit," Gheit said.

NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Corp. could pay as much as $80 billion to acquire Mobil Corp. as the two

$1.25 to $75.625.

EXXON and Mobil yesterday confirmed their intention to merge, creating a $250bn (#151bn) US oil group, but 
final negotiations have been held up by wrangling over the executive line-up. 
A joint statement from the two companies said that they "are in discussions concerning a possible combination 
transaction". It added: "No definitive agreement has been reached. We cannot give any assurance that an 
agreement will be reached." An announcement may be made on Monday, according to market rumours. 
Yesterday's statement boosted oil shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where Mobil rose 10% and Exxon 
5%. Other oil companies suggested as likely future merger candidates are Chevron and Texaco. 
The mega-merger wave in the oil sector was sparked in August by the $50bn combination of British Petroleum 
and Amoco. Wall Street analysts had predicted further consolidation in the industry, which has been affected by 
declining oil prices. 
The last big obstacle to conclusion of an Exxon-Mobil deal is believed to be the decision on who will head 
America's biggest company, measured by revenues. 
Lee Raymond, Exxon's executive chairman, and Lucio Noto, Mobil's executive chairman, are both experienced 
industry veterans who have worked for their respective companies for more than 35 years. Both men are 60 years 
old. The likeliest outcome of the final negotiations is a joint chairmanship of Mr Raymond and Mr Noto, with a 
view to finding a successor from the joint pool of executives. However, similar arrangements have soured other 
mega-mergers this year. 
The previously agreed merger of SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome fell apart when executives clashed, 
and the recent mergers of BankAmerica with NationsBank and of Citicorp with Travelers have had difficulty in 
making dual leadership structures work. After completion of the deals, executives in both the enlarged 
BankAmerica and the new Citigroup were forced out by pre-merger rivals. 
A takeover of Mobil by Exxon is likely to be worth about $70bn and would create a company bigger than the 
Royal Dutch/Shell, the world's number one energy company.

COMPANIES &FINANCE - Oil merger faces challenge of interpersonal combustion - Chiefs of Mobil and Exxon 
are steeped in very different corporate - cultures, write Christopher Parkes and Robert Corzine. 
Testosterone and ambition, the volatile mixture that drives many a business leader, can become outright 
explosive when moguls make a match. 
The recent past is littered with examples of post-merger personality clashes which underscore the difficulties 
ahead for Lee Raymond, conservative Exxon chairman, and Mobil's Lucio Noto, a hands-on manager who 
appears almost an iconoclast in comparison. 
Long-association, even friendship, can count for nothing when the talking is through, power-sharing becomes the 
issue, and blending corporate cultures becomes the over-riding preoccupation. 
NationsBank started out with two heads and the best of intentions after its merger with BankAmerica, but it was 
David Coulter, chief of the junior partner who was to walk out, leaving the field to NationsBank head, Hugh 
MacColl. 
Cultural conflicts have also dogged the three-year-old merger of Wells Fargo with the First Interstate Bank of 
California. 
The careers of Mr Raymond and Mr Noto have much in common. Both are life-time oil men, tutored for 
leadership in a business notable for its linear management, and both of an independent turn of mind. 
Mr Noto has shown most willingness to depart from the past, recently devolving power to almost a dozen 
operational divisions. He has also been more resolute than most of his US peers in cutting jobs and costs, shifting 
exploration decisively into remote, uncertain prospects in areas such as the Caspian and Azerbaijan. 
Aware that industry consolidation was inevitable, he was early into the field, hunting for partners, and started at 
least two years ago making passes at the likes of Chevron and Amoco. However, according to industry 
observers, talks came to nothing because Mr Noto was determined to retain full control. 
"He was probably right not to ignore the reality that at the end of the day mergers and partnerships are 
old-fashioned takeovers," said one industry consultant. Now, faced with the likely merger with a much bigger 
group, it looks as though he might have been wrong to assume he had a "God-given right" to prevail. 
While observers characterise Mr Raymond as a bureaucrat with more than a hint of the patriarch, they also point 
out that Exxon, for all its size, is still one of the best-run oil companies in the business, still favoured by investors 
because of its high return on assets. 
Although he has been accused of arrogance for his insistence that Exxon would "never" make a big acquisition 
because it did not need to and could grow using its internal resources, one observer said the description now 
seems unjust. 
His reluctance to enter the fray might have stemmed more from his recognition of the dangers of personality 
clashes. Bankers advising on deals have emphasised to prospective partners the need for clarity of management 
at the top, and down to the second or third tier, before any deal is announced. 
That clarity was one reason that the British Petroleum/Amoco deal was so warmly welcomed.

Page 123 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
It was clear that Sir John Browne, BP chief executive, would lead the combined entity, while Larry Fuller, Amoco 
chairman, had a specified date of departure. It was also clear that BP's corporate culture would dominate. 
Industry executives and analysts find it hard to see how Mr Noto and Mr Raymond could find common ground for 
longer than it takes to strike the deal, break the news and declare themselves eternal friends and allies. 
Both men have a reputation for abrasiveness, while and at the same time being steeped in quite distinct corporate 
cultures. 
Even though both companies emerged from the old Standard Oil monopoly broken up into the "Seven Sisters" in 
1911, their recent histories have been very different. Mobil has been far more aggressive, notably in its 
international ambitions. 
Mobil's refining and marketing joint venture with BP in Europe also showed that the US group was willing to enter 
into non-traditional deals if it saw a chance to unlock greater value. 
Perhaps more important was Mr Noto's willingness to accept that BP had the stronger brand in European 
markets, and allow the most recognisable display of its identity - the signs on its filling stations - to be replaced by 
the green and yellow shields of BP. 
This may not turn out to be the case in the US, where Exxon and Mobil have comparable motor-fuel market 
shares of about 10% each, although some regional overlaps seem likely to be eliminated. 
But the real questions over Mobil's ability to retain a separate identity will most likely be answered not on the 
forecourt, but in the offices of management, sales and marketing. 
Exxon is known as closed society. It does not employ people in mid-career from outside its ranks, or employ 
external consultants. It is going to have to break with at least one of these traditions if the merger is to proceed 
smoothly, but for how long is anyone's guess.

WHAT anti-trust laws pulled asunder 89 years ago plummeting oil prices may now join together again. 
The world's largest oil company, Exxon Corp, and number two US oil company, Mobil Corp, are considering a 
merger that could save the new entity up to $7 bn annually in pre-tax costs, sources familiar with the talks said. 
Sources say Texas-based Exxon and Fairfax, Va-based Mobil, pressured by oil prices at 25 years lows, could 
announce intentions on what would be the largest industrial merger ever as early as next week. 
Exxon and Mobil are the modern day siblings descended from the 1911 breakup of John D Rockefeller's 
Standard Oil Trust due to anti-trust violations. 
But market forces may now make a new union their only option. "Oil prices are beyond the industry's control. The 
only thing they can do is mergers and joint ventures," said Paul Spedding of Dresdner, Kleinwort Benson in 
London. 
With US markets closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, both companies were remaining tight-lipped, shifting the 
action to London where the talks between the two industry giants pushed shares of European oil companies 
sharply higher. 
A deal between Exxon and Mobil would follow this year's surprise alliance between British Petroleum Co Plc and 
Amoco Corp, which is targeting $2.0 bn in cost reductions. 
"The only real rationale for these companies is cost savings," said Michael Young, analyst at Deutsche Bank 
Securities in Boston, "There are no synergies that point to top line growth." 
The raft of mergers in the oil industry, headed by BP-Amoco, has seen Texaco Inc surrender control of its US and 
European refining and marketing operations in joint ventures with Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and has also seen 
Mobil form a European venture with BP. 
Exxon and Mobil would create an industry giant with a combined market capitalisation of some $240 bn and 
shunt Exxon into a league all on its own. 
A merged Exxon would be the third largest company in the world in terms of market capitalisation. 
In terms of its oil peers it would some 21.5 billion barrels of proven oil and gas reserves and daily oil product sales 
of 8.8 million barrels. 
This compares with 4.5 million barrels per day of product sales for BP-Amoco globally and reserves of 14.782 
billion barrels of oil and gas. 
Combined revenues for Exxon-Mobil in 1997 were some $200 bn, compared with $107 bn for BP-Amoco. 
But Exxon chief executive Lee Raymond has said is not something he desires, nor does he wish to reunite the 
Standard Oil Trust. 
What he has said he does desire, and what Exxon's management has been the best in the industry in delivering, 
is more value for shareholders. 
That is what stockholders want too.

"A larger entity would improve potential for the merged companies to produce better returns," said Andrew 
McMenigall, who manages US equities at Britain's Edinburgh fund managers. 
With oil prices set to remain weak, the benchmark Brent crude oil blend is stuck resolutely below $12 a barrel, 
despite cuts of around three million barrels from oil producing countries, Exxon and Mobil are feeling the 
pressure in their earnings. 
Analysts are forecasting that Exxon's 1998 earnings will fall to $6.4 bn from $8.46 bn a year ago and Mobil will 
see earnings drop $2.5 bn to $3.43 bn. 
But, while British Petroleum and Amoco may have successfully consummated their marriage, Mobil has been 
asked out many times, but never made it to the altar. 
Two years ago, Mobil held talks with Amoco on a US refining venture, but those failed, it also talked with BP on a 
full merger after their successful European alliance, which is generating annual savings of $500 mn. 
More recently, Mobil made an offer to DuPont Co. for parts of its Conoco Inc oil and gas business. Those talks 
too foundered and Conoco is now an independent oil company following a highly successful initial public offering 
last month. 
Mobil has also talked this year to its bankers about merger options with Chevron Corp, and prior to the news of a 
link-up with Exxon, had been touted by analysts as the buyer of Atlantic Richfield Co. 
"There are two reasons that deals fall, corporate culture and personality clashes," said Fred Leuffer, analyst at 
Bear Sterns. 
Some analysts also question what Mobil, with a market capitalisation of around $60 bn and operations around 
the globe would gain from a merger, especially as Exxon's reputation for tough management and cost control is 
likely to translate into a rather parsimonious offer price. 
They also note that any merger is unlikely to be a carbon copy of the much-praised acquisition of Amoco by BP. 
"The reason that BP-Amoco worked is that Amoco is rolling over and BP is going to slice open and gut the 
company. Amoco's strategic efforts had failed and they were not cutting it as an international oil company," said 
Deutsche's Young. 
He added that that Mobil investors could get as little as 1.1 Exxon shares for each Mobil share they own, far less 
than the 20 per cent premium which some analysts have touted.

NEW YORK: Exxon Corp, the world's largest energy company, is in talks to acquire rival Mobil Corp, the second 
largest US oil company, in a stock transaction, sources familiar with the deal said on Wednesday. 
The companies have not yet determined an acquisition price for Mobil and it was thought they were still 
evaluating the value of the proposed deal, the sources said. 
They said a final transaction could be struck as early as next week. The deal would be the largest industrial 
merger and could be the largest merger ever. 
Fairfax, Virginia-based Mobil has a market capitalisation of more than $60 billion and Exxon, based in Irving, 
Texas, has a market capitalisation of about $176 billion. 
Mobil shares surged nearly 5 per cent on Wednesday as takeover rumours once again gripped the stock, despite 
a fall in oil prices to 12-year lows. Mobil's stock rose $3.44 to $78.38 a share in New York Stock Exchange 
composite trade, while Exxon shares fell 13 cents to $72.63 on Wednesday. 
Details such as the posts that Mobil and Exxon top executives would hold at the combined company were not 
immediately available. 
The rumours, which Mobil has declined to comment on in the past, centred on three potential scenarios: Exxon 
buying Mobil, Mobil merging with Chevron Corp, or Mobil buying Atlantic Richfield Inc (ARCO). 
Officials at Mobil could not be reached while officials at Exxon said they would not comment on market rumours. 
These talks come on the heels of British Petroleum Co Plc's surprise acquisition this summer of Amoco Corp in a 
$49 billion deal, which had previously been the world's largest industrial merger announcement. Earlier on 
Wednesday, BP shareholders overwhelming approved of its planned takeover of Amoco. 
The BP-Amoco deal, if completed, would create the world's third largest energy company behind Exxon and the 
British/Dutch energy giant Royal Dutch Shell Group. 
Over the past few years, oil and gas companies have engaged in massive restructurings which have reduced 
costs to the point that they are now not able to cut any more. 
Analysts, therefore, have predicted that with the price of oil at 12-year lows, the only way the industry will grow is 
through consolidation. 
Exxon, however, was not considered to be on the prowl for a partner because it was believed that Exxon could 
stand on its own against the combined BP-Amoco. 
A Wall Street analyst who asked not to be identified said the rumour had been going all day that Mobil was in 
some type of merger and acquisition deal. 
"It would put a lot of pressure on the medium-sized players, like ARCO and Chevron who may be vulnerable, to 
pursue mergers of their own," said the analyst. 
"It should definitely be a positive for Mobil ... the rumour has already added about 20 per cent in value to Mobil. 
Exxon has done a good job of generating superior returns and will likely continue to do so," the analyst said.

But at least one investment banker who specialises in the energy industry said, "A Mobil-Exxon combination 
would be rife with cultural challenges." 
"To see it happen is astonishing ... I'll be interested to see how the social issues work out," said the investment 
banker who did not want to be identified. 
Exxon is widely known to be an extremely conservatively run company led by Lee Raymond, the company's 
chairman and chief executive officer. Meanwhile, Mobil chief executive Lucio Noto has aggressively revamped 
the company and slashed costs since taking over the helm in 1994. 
A justice department spokeswoman had no comment on the merger discussions, saying it was too soon to say 
whether any possible antitrust concerns would be investigated by the justice department, or the federal trade 
commission, which is looking into the BP-Amoco merger. 
Robert Litan, a former justice department attorney, said any merger of Exxon and Mobil would come under close 
scrutiny for possible antitrust violations. 
The companies' production and pipeline businesses were unlikely to pose much of a problem, but refining and 
marketing could cause some concerns, Mr Litan said. 
But he noted that government regulators were not looking to bust mergers, and would often recommend the 
divesting of certain businesses, if that would allow the merger to proceed. 
"If they see a merger that can be fixed, they'll usually try to do it," Mr Litan said. (Reuters).

IN what could be one of the biggest takeovers ever, Exxon, the world's largest oil company, is in advanced talks 
to take over Mobil, the second largest US oil and gas group, oil analysts said after reports surfaced in London 
that a deal was in the works. 
The companies would not confirm what appears to be leaks by informed market sources, but if they do combine, 
the market value on present prices would be around US$238 billion (S$391.3 billion). 
Exxon is the larger of the two companies with a market value of US$176.7 billion, while Mobil's market value 
stands at US$61.1 billion. 
Financial terms of the potential merger could not be determined yesterday but Bloomberg quoted a person 
familiar with the talks as saying Exxon would buy Mobil for at least US$61 billion. 
Together the companies would have about 22 per cent of the US gasoline market, refine more oil than any 
company in the world and rank first among the Fortune 500 companies based on revenue. 
Combined, the companies would be bigger than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest publicly traded oil 
company. 
A merger would boost their operations in Asia, from creating the second-largest gasoline retailer in Japan to 
controlling half Singapore's crude oil refining capacity. 
The combined company "would be the best, bar none, global oil concern", Bloomberg quoted Fadel Gheit, an 
analyst at Fahnestock & Co in New York who rates both companies "buy". Any plan to merge the oil giants would 
get close scrutiny from regulators, antitrust lawyers say. 
According to the Financial Times, Exxon is being advised by J P Morgan and Mobil by Goldman Sachs. The 
investment banks also refused to comment yesterday. 
Boards of both companies are discussing a merger because the global oil industry is under considerable pressure 
from falling prices and intense competition, analysts said. A merger would help the companies cut costs. 
Peter Gignoux of Salomon Smith Barney in London said Brent oil quotes are currently at 12-year lows of 
US$10.90 a barrel. That means cash prices are as low as US$10 and Arab heavy oil is trading at only US$6.50 a 
barrel, he said. 
Over a one-and-a-half year period, oil prices have fallen 40 per cent caused by a combination of a supply glut and 
falling demand in Asia due to the financial and economic crisis. Many producers are losing at these levels, said 
Mr Gignoux, and development is being kept on hold. 
Oil company earnings fell along with oil prices. Exxon's profit fell 23 per cent in the third quarter, while Mobil's fell 
45 per cent. 
Despite the gloomy industry outlook, expectations of an Exxon takeover of Mobil boosted European oil shares by 
between one and 3 per cent in early trading yesterday. 
Total shares were up 26 francs at 680, Elf Aquitaine by 14 francs to 71, Shell by 7 pence to 360 pence and British 
Petroleum gained 12 pence to 945 pence.

Page 129 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
In New York on Wednesday, the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday, Mobil's stock rose 3 7/16 or 4.6 per cent to 
78-3/8. Exxon shares, however, declined -1/8 to 72-5/8. Yesterday in Germany, Mobil rose 14.5 marks, or 11 per 
cent, to 144 marks. Exxon rose 11 marks, or 9 per cent, to 133 marks. Several analysts warned that there would 
have to be confirmation of a merger for oil shares to really motor ahead. 
Jeremy Elden, head of oil and gas research at Commerzbank in London, said a potential deal would have major 
ramifications for other European oil companies which could easily follow suit. 
"BP would probably buy out Mobil's share of the European downstream joint venture. Elf-Aquitaine, ENI and 
Total would be faced with increasing urgency to merge and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group fall behind the other 
giants," he said. 
Mr Elden is concerned about the leaks because they indicated that there could be internal opposition to any deal - 
probably from the Mobil side. 
If that was the case, any potential takeover could be acrimonious and the companies could call off the deal. 
Analysts in New York agreed, predicting that Exxon and Mobil, both known for being fiercely independent, could 
prove to be a difficult match. "It would be a very difficult combination," said Seth Kanvis, analyst at Circle 
Research. 
"Given the very strong personalities of senior management at both companies and the complex network of 
business both companies run, I'd anticipate some problems." 
Exxon, whose chairman is Lee Raymond, is based in Irving, Texas. Mobil is headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia. 
Its chairman is Lucio Noto. 
Officials at Exxon and Mobil declined BT's request for comment on the discussions and their current status. 
A merger, analysts said, would be healthy for oil shares. 
"Oil shares, hammered by bad oil prices, require takeover bids to push them higher. The industry is going through 
a period of marriages, and the trend is likely to continue," one analyst said. 
Any takeover would follow BP's US$55 billion acquisition of Amoco last August. BP's purchase meant that Mobil 
found it difficult to compete, analysts said. 
Oil analysts also believe that there will be consolidation of smaller oil companies and there have been rumours 
that Petrofina of Belgium would combine with Elf Aquitaine of France. 
John Browne, chief executive-designate of BP Amoco predicted recently that there would be a "super league" of 
three companies: Exxon, followed by BP/Amoco and Royal/Dutch Shell. 
The merger would represent a reunion of sorts for the two companies, both of which were part of the Standard Oil 
Trust, which was owned by John D Rockefeller until the US Supreme Court ruled it a monopoly in 1911 and broke 
up the company into several corporations. 
The Federal Trade Commission said it has not yet been notified of the merger discussions. 
Alan Roberts, an attorney specialising in antitrust law, said that the combination of the two companies would likely 
be heavily scrutinised by government regulators. 
"They would have to be concerned over how large a portion of the industry the combined entity would control," he 
said.

CHRISTOPHER COOPER in Houston ALLANNA SULLIVAN in New York 
The persistent failure of the once-powerful OPEC cartel to manipulate world oil prices has led to an unlikely 
courtship: merger talks between the two titans of the U.S. oil industry. 
In a world where new technology, growing global competition and persistently low oil prices appear to have 
permanently changed the oil industry, Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have begun talks about a combination, 
although people familiar with the discussions cautioned that the two haven't reached any agreement. 
Such a marriage would create an awesome oil giant -- much bigger than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, currently the 
world's largest oil company. With both companies already operating on every continent and in dozens of 
countries, Exxon and Mobil combined could take on any kind of oil or natural gas project around the globe. 
Still, many in the industry already are questioning whether such a union could succeed, noting that the two 
fiercely independent cultures seem to be a poor fit and that a merger would likely run into regulatory troubles in 
Europe, if not the United States. Indeed, a merger would reunite the two biggest pieces of the Standard Oil trust 
broken up by the U.S. government in 1911. 
While the logic of the potential merger is being widely debated, the underlying motivation is not: Across the 
ocean, the 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have all but given up on trying to 
prop up crude oil prices, and the oil industry is preparing for another grueling slide in world prices, profits and 
production. Worse, with trust waning among the group's members, little stands in the way of an all-out battle over 
market share. 
"Consciously or unconsciously, they are shifting their strategy," says Roger Diwan, director of global oil markets 
at Washington-based Petroleum Finance Co. "Why should they cut production to keep high-cost American 
producers in the market?" 
Yet, if maintaining or building market share becomes OPEC's main goal, the members could unleash a flood of oil 
on an already glutted market, driving oil prices down to single digits. Such a move would be devastating for oil 
producers in higher-cost nations like the United States and Canada and would lead to more mergers. 
"The companies move fast. They can see very low oil prices for the next three or four years," says Leo Drollas, 
chief economist at London's Centre for Global Energy Studies. 
Oil companies have seen their profits fall dramatically in recent months, as prices have slid about 30 per cent 
from a year earlier. Big companies are slashing employees and exploration budgets, and some smaller 
companies have begun to default on debt. 
Going into this year, oil companies big and small were smug in their belief that they could survive this latest 
downturn in prices. The long 1980s oil recession had forced them to become lean, and new technology has 
helped reduce the cost of bringing crude and natural gas from the ground. But few predicted that prices would

Page 133 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
stay so low for so long -- or that they would continue to fall. On Wednesday, the January contract for West Texas 
Intermediate crude closed at $11.86 (U.S.) a barrel, down 26 cents and flirting with 12-year lows. 
The need to cut costs even deeper has led to a rash of mergers, including the agreement this summer for British 
Petroleum PLC to buy Amoco Corp. for about $48-billion, creating a third "super-major" to compete with Exxon 
and Royal Dutch/Shell. Smaller companies have followed: In October, Kerr McGee Corp. agreed to buy troubled 
Oryx Energy Co. and this week, Ocean Energy Inc. and Seagull Energy agreed to merge. 
Mobil, based in Fairfax, Va., and the No. 2 U.S. oil company, has long been rumoured a merger candidate and is 
known to have held talks with both Amoco and British Petroleum. On Wednesday, Mobil shares rallied sharply to 
close at $78.37, up $3.43, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, and trading was unusually heavy in 
options on its shares as rumours swirled that talks were progressing with a merger partner. That gives Mobil a 
market value of $63.88-billion. 
The talks are surprising, given the companies' vastly different cultures. Lee Raymond, the intense chairman and 
chief executive of Exxon, based in Irving, Tex., and the largest U.S. oil company, dismissed reporters' questions 
about acquisitions at the annual meeting this year, saying the company could successfully grow on its own. 
Meanwhile, industry insiders say that Mobil's past talks with potential partners often stalled because the 
company's aggressive chairman and chief executive officer, Lucio A. Noto, hasn't wanted to cede control. Any 
combination, however, almost certainly would put Mr. Raymond and Exxon in control. 
People familiar with the talks say they are believed to be at a relatively early stage. Any negotiations would have 
to eventually bring in British Petroleum, which has an extensive refining-and-marketing joint venture with Mobil in 
Europe. Given that Exxon has nearly 10,000 stations in Europe and Mobil-BP have more than 8,000, a combined 
company probably would have to sell some assets. BP is expected to seek to buy out Mobil's piece of their 
venture. 
The clear benefit of a combined Exxon-Mobil would be on the exploration side of the business, where Mobil has 
been more aggressive. Exxon's reputation for conservatism has made its debt ratio and cost structure the envy of 
the industry. But Exxon's developed reserves are dropping in Asia, Europe, Canada and elsewhere, while 
additions to its reserves, primarily in the United States, are growing slowly. 
Further, Exxon isn't a major player in some of the more exciting areas of global oil exploration. In the Caspian Sea 
region, Mobil, with a 25-per-cent share of the giant Tengiz oil field, is among the best-positioned companies; 
Exxon, by contrast, has a small stake in a Caspian field that thus far is producing at a trickle. More generally, the 
amount of oil Mobil has on hand grew 8.5 per cent in 1997, and its five-year reserve-replacement ratio is 147 per 
cent of production, while Exxon's reserves grew by less than 1 per cent last year, and its five-year 
reserve-replacement ratio averages 102 per cent. 
"The criticism I hear about Exxon is they don't have much creativity upstream," says Matthew Simmons of 
Simmons & Co. International, a Houston investment banking firm. "On the other hand, I think Mobil is first rate. A 
merged company would be a very powerful company indeed." 
Analysts say Exxon is well-positioned for such a merger because its conservative strategy has kept its stock 
resilient at time when other companies have been hammered by low commodity prices. 
The potential for savings can be immense. BP reckons that after merging with Amoco, savings will amount to 
$2-billion annually. 
An Exxon-Mobil combination would add to pressure on other large oil companies, particularly Royal Dutch/Shell, 
which has a relatively dismal record of generating profits from its assets. "It's another wake-up call for Shell," says 
Fergus MacLeod, an analyst at BT Alex. Brown in Edinburgh who, like others, is now waiting for Shell to disclose, 
at an analysts meeting on Dec. 14, how it intends to improve profitability and revive shareholder confidence.

EXXON Corp, the world's largest energy company, is in talks to acquire Mobil Corp - America's second-biggest 
oil firm, in a stock transaction. 
Executives of the companies have not apparently arrived at an acquisition price for Mobil. It was believed they 
were still evaluating the value of the deal. 
But agreement could be reached as early as next week, people close to the talks said. A deal would be the 
largest industrial merger and perhaps the largest-ever merger. 
Mobil has a market capitalisation of more than US$60 billion (HK$466 billion) and Exxon about US$176 billion. 
Mobil shares surged nearly 5 per cent on Wednesday as takeover rumours once again gripped the stock. That 
was despite a fall in oil prices to 12-year lows. Mobil's stock rose US$3.44 to US$78.38 a share in New York 
Stock Exchange composite trade while Exxon shares fell 13 US cents to US$72.63. 
Market talk centred on three potential scenarios: Exxon buying Mobil, Mobil merging with Chevron Corp, or 
Mobil buying Atlantic Richfield. 
Officials at Mobil could not be reached while officials at Exxon said they would not comment on market rumours. 
The move followed the surprise acquisition by British Petroleum (BP) in the summer of Amoco Corp. That US$49 
billion deal has stood as the world's largest industrial merger. 
Earlier on Wednesday, BP shareholders gave overwhelming approval to the move. If completed, it will create the 
world's third-largest energy company behind Exxon and British-Dutch giant Royal Dutch Shell Group.

NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Mobil Corp. is in merger talks with Exxon Corp. which, if consummated, would 
be the biggest industrial merger in history. But, based on its previous record, this could also be the latest in a 
series of engagements for Fairfax, Va-based Mobil which never quite made it to the altar. If completed, the 
merger would retie the knot between two key players of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust unravelled in 
1911 on anti-trust grounds, but previous experience shows that family ties are no guarantee of success. 
Two years ago, Mobil held talks with Amoco Corp. , the former Standard Oil of Indiana, on a U.S. refining and 
marketing joint venture, but those foundered when Amoco asked for a larger slice of the business than Mobil was 
prepared to give. 
Today, Amoco is now in the process of merging with British Petroleum Co. Plc. to form the world's third largest 
publicly traded oil company. 
Mobil also held talks with BP for a full merger after the two companies' European refining and marketing venture, 
yet those came to nothing. 
More recently, Mobil made an offer to DuPont Co. for parts of its Conoco Inc. oil and gas business. Those talks 
too foundered and Conoco is now an independent oil company following a highly successful initial public offering 
last month. 
The problem, analysts say is that corporate cultures and chief executives clash, and tough-talking Lucio Noto, the 
chief executive of Mobil may find it difficult to strike a deal with Lee Raymond, the Chief Executive of Irving, 
Texas-based Exxon. 
"There are two reasons that deals fall, corporate culture and personality clashes," said Fred Leuffer, analyst at 
Bear Sterns. 
Analysts also question what Mobil, with a market capitalization of around $60 billion and operations around the 
globe would gain from a merger, especially as Exxon's reputation for tough management and cost control is likely 
to translate into a rather parsimonious offer price. 
They also note that any merger is unlikely to be a carbon copy of the much-praised acquisition of Amoco by BP. 
"The reason that BP-Amoco worked is that Amoco is rolling over and BP is going to slice open and gut the 
company. Amoco's strategic efforts had failed and they were not cutting it as an international oil company," said 
Michael Young, analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. 
He says that Mobil has a worldwide portfolio of high quality oil and gas assets and a truly global reach. 
In the the third quarter of 1998, Mobil had daily output of 236,000 barrels of liquids in the U.S. and 685,000 
barrels overseas. Natural gas production was 1.1 billion cubic feet in the U.S. and almost 3.0 billion cubic feet 
overseas. 
Sales of oil products in the U.S. were 1.49 million barrels and overseas 2.0 million. 
Mobil's proved reserves at the end of 1997 were 7.177 billion barrels of oil equivalent 
While the sum of all of this is smaller than Exxon, it is no mean number, said Young.

Page 136 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"What does Lou Noto know about the oil industry if he believes that the only way forward is to sell his company," 
Young noted. 
Exxon's daily liquids output was 484,000 barrels in the U.S. and 1.07 million overseas, plus 2.0 billion cubic feet 
of U.S. gas and 3.2 billion cubic feet overseas. 
Its daily product sales were 1.341 million barrels per day domestically and some four million barrels overseas. 
Exxon had 13.8 billion barrels of proved oil and gas reserves at the end of 1997. 
"Both of these companies are huge in their reach. There is no one economic reason why Exxon needs to be 
bigger," said Young. 
"But what we have clearly seen over the past year is that there is no smoke without fire," he added. ((David

NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - What antitrust laws pulled asunder 89 years ago plummeting oil prices may now 
join together again. 
The world's largest oil company, Exxon Corp. and No. 2 U.S. oil company, Mobil Corp., are considering a merger 
that could save the new entity up to $7 billion annually in pretax costs, sources familiar with the talks said. 
The sources say that Irving, Texas-based Exxon and Fairfax, Va.-based Mobil, pressured by oil prices at 25 
years lows, could announce their intentions on what would be the largest industrial merger ever as early as next 
week. 
Exxon and Mobil are the modern day siblings descended from the 1911 breakup of John D. Rockefeller's 
Standard Oil Trust due to antitrust violations. 
But market forces may now make a new union their only option. 
"Oil prices are beyond the industry's control. The only thing they can do is mergers and joint ventures," said Paul 
Spedding of Dresdner, Kleinwort Benson in London. 
With U.S. markets closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, both companies were remaining tight-lipped, shifting the 
action to London where the talks between the two industry giants pushed shares of European oil companies 
sharply higher. 
A deal between Exxon and Mobil would follow this year's surprise alliance between British Petroleum Co. Plc and 
Amoco Corp., which is targeting $2.0 billion in cost reductions. 
"The only real rationale for these companies is cost savings," said Michael Young, analyst at Deutsche Bank 
Securities in Boston. "There are no synergies that point to top line growth." 
The raft of mergers in the oil industry, headed by BP-Amoco, has seen Texaco Inc. surrender control of its U.S. 
and European refining and marketing operations in joint ventures with Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and has also 
seen Mobil form a European venture with BP. 
Exxon and Mobil would create an industry giant with a combined market capitalisation of some $240 billion and 
shunt Exxon into a league all on its own. 
A merged Exxon would be the third-largest company in the world in terms of market capitalisation. 
In terms of its oil peers it would some 21.5 billion barrels of proven oil and gas reserves and daily oil product sales 
of 8.8 million barrels. 
This compares with 4.5 million barrels per day of product sales for BP-Amoco globally and reserves of 14.782 
billion barrels of oil and gas. 
Combined revenues for Exxon-Mobil in 1997 were some $200 billion, compared with $107 billion for BP-Amoco. 
But Exxon Chief Executive Lee Raymond has said is not something he desires, nor does he wish to reunite the 
Standard Oil Trust.

What he has said he does desire, and what Exxon's management has been the best in the industry in delivering, 
is more value for shareholders. 
That is what stockholders want too. 
"A larger entity would improve potential for the merged companies to produce better returns," said Andrew 
McMenigall, who manages U.S. equities at Britain's Edinburgh fund managers. 
With oil prices set to remain weak, the benchmark Brent crude oil blend is stuck resolutely below $12 a barrel, 
despite cuts of around three million barrels from oil producing countries, Exxon and Mobil are feeling the 
pressure in their earnings. 
Analysts are forecasting that Exxon's 1998 earnings will fall to $6.4 billion from $8.46 billion a year ago and Mobil 
will see earnings drop $2.5 billion to $3.43 billion. 
But, while British Petroleum and Amoco may have successfully consummated their marriage, Mobil has been 
asked out many times, but never made it to the altar. 
Two years ago, Mobil held talks with Amoco on a U.S. refining venture, but those failed, it also talked with BP on 
a full merger after their successful European alliance, which is generating annual savings of $500 million. 
More recently, Mobil made an offer to DuPont Co. for parts of its Conoco Inc. oil and gas business. Those talks 
too foundered and Conoco is now an independent oil company following a highly successful initial public offering 
last month. 
Mobil has also talked this year to its bankers about merger options with Chevron Corp., and prior to the news of a 
link-up with Exxon, had been touted by analysts as the buyer of Atlantic Richfield Co. 
"There are two reasons that deals fall, corporate culture and personality clashes," said Fred Leuffer, analyst at 
Bear Sterns. 
Some analysts also question what Mobil, with a market capitalisation of around $60 billion and operations around 
the globe would gain from a merger, especially as Exxon's reputation for tough management and cost control is 
likely to translate into a rather parsimonious offer price. 
They also note that any merger is unlikely to be a carbon copy of the much-praised acquisition of Amoco by BP. 
"The reason that BP-Amoco worked is that Amoco is rolling over and BP is going to slice open and gut the 
company. Amoco's strategic efforts had failed and they were not cutting it as an international oil company," said 
Deutsche's Young. 
He added that that Mobil investors could get as little as 1.1 Exxon shares for each Mobil share they own, far less 
than the 20 percent premium which some analysts have touted. 
"I just do not see Exxon paying a premium," he said. 
Mobil shares closed in New York on Wednesday at $78.365, up $3.875, while stock ended down 12.5 cents at 
$72.625.

NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - As oil producing countries meet in Vienna to seek a solution to the lowest oil 
prices in real terms for 25 years, Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. appear poised with a remedy of their own which 
could result in the world's largest industrial merger. 
Sources familiar with the talks say that Irving, Texas-based Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company 
in the world and Mobil, the second largest U.S. oil company, could announce their merger intentions as early as 
next week. 
But with U.S. markets closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, both companies were remaining tight-lipped and the 
action shifted to London where the talks between the two industry giants pushed shares of European oil 
companies sharply higher. 
A deal between Exxon and Mobil would follow this year's surprise alliance between British Petroleum Co. Plc. 
and Amoco Corp., which is targeting $2.0 billion in cost reductions. 
If Exxon and Mobil do merge, and that is a big if as the talks could still founder at this late stage, cost savings 
could be as much as $7.0 billion, according to industry analysts. 
"The only real rationale for these companies is cost savings," said Michael Young, analyst at Deutsche Bank 
Securities in Boston, "There are no synergies that point to top line growth." 
The raft of mergers in the oil industry, headed by BP-Amoco, has seen Texaco Inc. surrender control of its U.S. 
and European refining and marketing operations in joint ventures with Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and has also 
seen Mobil form a European venture with BP.

Combined revenues for Exxon-Mobil in 1997 were some $200 billion, compared with $107 billion for BP-Amoco. 
But sheer size is something Exxon chief executive Lee Raymond has said is not something he desires, nor does 
he wish to reunite the John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust which unravelled in 1911. 
What he has said he does desire, and what Exxon's management has been the best in the industry in delivering,

NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Mobil Corp. is in merger talks with Exxon Corp. which, if consummated, would 
be the biggest industrial merger in history. 
But, based on its previous record, this could also be the latest in a series of engagements for Fairfax, Va-based 
Mobil which never quite made it to the altar. 
If completed, the merger would retie the knot between two key players of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust 
unravelled in 1911 on anti-trust grounds, but previous experience shows that family ties are no guarantee of 
success. 
Two years ago, Mobil held talks with Amoco Corp., the former Standard Oil of Indiana, on a U.S. refining and 
marketing joint venture, but those foundered when Amoco asked for a larger slice of the business than Mobil was 
prepared to give. 
Today, Amoco is now in the process of merging with British Petroleum Co. Plc. to form the world's third largest 
publicly traded oil company. 
Mobil also held talks with BP for a full merger after the two companies' European refining and marketing venture, 
yet those came to nothing. 
More recently, Mobil made an offer to DuPont Co. for parts of its Conoco Inc. oil and gas business. Those talks 
too foundered and Conoco is now an independent oil company following a highly successful initial public offering 
last month. 
The problem, analysts say is that corporate cultures and chief executives clash, and tough-talking Lucio Noto, the 
chief executive of Mobil may find it difficult to strike a deal with Lee Raymond, the Chief Executive of Irving, 
Texas-based Exxon. 
"There are two reasons that deals fall, corporate culture and personality clashes," said Fred Leuffer, analyst at 
Bear Sterns. 
Analysts also question what Mobil, with a market capitalisation of around $60 billion and operations around the

company. Amoco's strategic efforts had failed and they were not cutting it as an international oil company," said 
Michael Young, analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. 
He says that Mobil has a worldwide portfolio of high quality oil and gas assets and a truly global reach. 
In the the third quarter of 1998, Mobil had daily output of 236,000 barrels of liquids in the U.S. and 685,000 
barrels overseas. Natural gas production was 1.1 billion cubic feet in the U.S. and almost 3.0 billion cubic feet 
overseas. 
Sales of oil products in the U.S. were 1.49 million barrels and overseas 2.0 million.

Page 142 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Mobil's proved reserves at the end of 1997 were 7.177 billion barrels of oil equivalent 
While the sum of all of this is smaller than Exxon, it is no mean number, said Young. 
"What does Lou Noto know about the oil industry if he believes that the only way forward is to sell his company," 
Young noted. 
Exxon's daily liquids output was 484,000 barrels in the U.S. and 1.07 million overseas, plus 2.0 billion cubic feet 
of U.S. gas and 3.2 billion cubic feet overseas. 
Its daily product sales were 1.341 million barrels per day domestically and some four million barrels overseas. 
Exxon had 13.8 billion barrels of proved oil and gas reserves at the end of 1997. 
"Both of these companies are huge in their reach. There is no one economic reason why Exxon needs to be 
bigger," said Young. 
"But what we have clearly seen over the past year is that there is no smoke without fire," he added.

NEW YORK, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Exxon Corp. , the world's largest energy company, is in talks to acquire rival 
Mobil Corp. , the second largest U.S. oil company, in a stock transaction, sources familiar with the deal told 
Reuters Wednesday night. 
The companies have not yet determined an acquisition price for Mobil and it was thought they were still 
evaluating the value of the proposed deal, said the sources. 
The sources said a final transaction could be struck as early as next week. The deal would be the largest 
industrial merger and could be the largest merger ever. 
Fairfax, Va.-based Mobil has a market capitalisation of more than $60 billion and Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, 
has a market capitalisation of about $176 billion. 
Mobil shares surged nearly 5 percent on Wednesday as takeover rumours once again gripped the stock, despite 
a fall in oil prices to 12-year lows. Mobil's stock rose $3.44 to $78.38 a share in New York Stock Exchange 
composite trade, while Exxon shares fell 13 cents to $72.63 on Wednesday. 
Details such as the posts that Mobil and Exxon top executives would hold at the combined company were not 
immediately available. 
The rumours, which Mobil has declined to comment on in the past, centred on three potential scenarios: Exxon 
buying Mobil, Mobil merging with Chevron Corp. , or Mobil buying Atlantic Richfield Inc. (ARCO) . 
Officials at Mobil could not be reached while officials at Exxon said they would not comment on market rumours. 
These talks come on the heels of British Petroleum Co Plc's surprise acquisition this summer of Amoco Corp. in a 
$49 billion deal, which had previously been the world's largest industrial merger announcement. Earlier on 
Wednesday, BP shareholders overwhelming approved of its planned takeover of Amoco. 
The BP-Amoco deal, if completed, would create the world's third largest energy company behind Exxon and the 
British/Dutch energy giant Royal Dutch Shell Group . 
Over the past few years, oil and gas companies have engaged in massive restructurings which have reduced 
costs to the point that they are now not able to cut any more. 
Analysts, therefore, have predicted that with the price of oil at 12-year lows, the only way the industry will grow is 
through consolidation. 
Exxon, however, was not considered to be on the prowl for a partner because it was believed that Exxon could 
stand on its own against the combined BP-Amoco. 
A Wall Street analyst who asked not to be identified said the rumour had been going all day that Mobil was in 
some type of merger and acquisition deal. 
"It would put a lot of pressure on the medium-sized players, like ARCO and Chevron who may be vulnerable, to 
pursue mergers of their own," said the analyst. 
"It should definitely be a positive for Mobil ... the rumour has already added about 20 percent in value to Mobil. 
Exxon has done a good job of generating superior returns and will likely continue to do so," the analyst said.

Page 146 of 152 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
But at least one investment banker who specialises in the energy industry said, "A Mobil-Exxon combination 
would be rife with cultural challenges." 
"To see it happen is astonishing ... I'll be interested to see how the social issues work out," said the investment 
banker who did not want to be identified. 
Exxon is widely known to be an extremely conservatively run company led by Lee Raymond, the company's 
chairman and chief executive officer. Meanwhile, Mobil Chief Executive Lucio Noto has aggressively revamped 
the company and slashed costs since taking over the helm in 1994. 
A Justice Department spokeswoman had no comment on the merger discussions, saying it was too soon to say 
whether any possible antitrust concerns would be investigated by the Justice Department, or the Federal Trade 
Commission, which is looking into the BP-Amoco merger. 
Robert Litan, a former Justice Department attorney, said any merger of Exxon and Mobil would come under close 
scrutiny for possible antitrust violations. 
The companies' production and pipeline businesses were unlikely to pose much of a problem, but refining and 
marketing could cause some concerns, Litan said. 
But he noted that government regulators were not looking to bust mergers, and would often recommend the 
divesting of certain businesses, if that would allow the merger to proceed. 
"If they see a merger that can be fixed, they'll usually try to do it," Litan said.

Exxon moves to top super league in surprise move. 
Exxon moves to top super league in surprise move.

Recently, Sir John Browne, the chief executive-designate of BP Amoco, the group that will emerge from the 
current takeover of Amoco of the US by British Petroleum, was asked what other combination of oil companies 
would cause him most concern as a potential competitor. His answer came without hesitation: "Exxon and Mobil." 
Asked why that tie-up would pose such a threat, he said: "Because they would be everywhere." 
But news of talks between the two is likely to come as a surprise to many senior executives in BP and elsewhere 
in the industry. 
Many had expected the next move in what may turn out to be a dramatic wave of sector consolidation to come 
from some of the smaller, more vulnerable integrated companies, such as Petrofina of Belgium, subject of much 
recent talk of a tie-up with Elf Aquitaine of France. 
As with the BP/Amoco link-up, the term merger in the context of any Exxon and Mobil marriage serves more as 
an accounting fig-leaf to provide discreet cover to what most in the industry will see as an outright takeover of 
Mobil by Exxon. 
When Sir John announced the BP/Amoco deal in August, he spoke of the emergence of a "super league" of three 
companies at the top of the international oil league table; Exxon, Royal Dutch/Shell and BP/Amoco. If Exxon and 
Mobil combine, many analysts and investors may come to regard the super league as having just two players, an 
enlarged Exxon and BP/Amoco. 
That is because the scope for cost savings at the two companies - and of delivering high returns to investors in a 
depressed oil price environment - far exceeds that at Shell, which is struggling to shake off an internal malaise 
and to overcome decades of heavy investment in what have proved to be relatively low return assets, especially 
in chemicals. 
In recent years Exxon has been industry leader in its return on capital employed, the main measure by which big 
integrated oil companies, and their investors, gauge their competitive performance. 
Shell, which has struggled to meet the industry average, claims Exxon - which has regularly shrunk its capital 
base through share buy-backs - has sacrificed long-term growth in order to deliver short-term performance, a 
point that Exxon executives strongly dispute. 
If a two-company super league does emerge, it would pose an interesting choice for investors and possibly 
difficult dilemmas for BP Amoco. 
One of the financial rationales behind the Anglo-American link-up was that the combined group, under the 
widely-admired leadership of Sir John, would be able to cut more costs than other integrated companies. The 
theory, as espoused by merchant bankers involved in the deal, was that such superior performance would be 
rewarded by a higher share price. The underlying message to investors was that BP Amoco would soon 
challenge Exxon for the premier position. 
That target might quickly recede if an Exxon/Mobil deal is consummated. Lee Raymond, Exxon chairman, has 
an equally admired reputation as a ruthless cost-cutter. And Exxon's ability to deliver what the market wants is 
unblemished, at least in recent years.

BP Amoco, however, may score more points on style. Exxon is often likened to a machine, with little scope for 
individual flair. 
Critics say its style of deal-making is wooden and inflexible, dictated more by the requirements of accountants 
back at head office in Texas rather than designed for the realities of a fast-changing international environment, 
where political savviness and connections count for much. 
But so too does size. A combined Exxon/Mobil entity would have the financial, and technical clout to take on a 
larger number of the very biggest deals that are likely to emerge in coming years. 
That means it can spread its risk over a wider range of high potential projects. And it would be well suited to 
exploit any opportunities that might arise if the owners of the world's biggest oil reserves, such as Saudi Arabia, 
actually do open their oil industries to foreign capital in a move that would herald a new era in the world's oil 
industry.

The planned merger of Exxon and Mobil seems superficially to give the lie to the notion aired recently by Peter 
Bijur, Texaco's chief executive, that "the days of the traditional oil company are almost over." 
After all, the emergence of a new giant power in the energy industry appears to be more of a throwback to the 
days of the industry's first 100 years. 
That was when the likes of John D. Rockefeller - founder of the original company which was to end up as Exxon 
in 1972 - dominated the US with long-armed corporations which controlled every aspect of oil from the drill bit to 
the forecourt fuel pump. 
Even now there is an old-style dynastic air in many oil company executive suites, where outsiders are rare. 
Exxon's chief, Lee Raymond, for example, spent years as "crown prince" to Lawrence Rawl, in which position he 
learnt grand-scale diplomacy steering the company out of the shadow of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster. 
Mobil's Lucio Noto has spent all his working life at Mobil. And he appears to have been preparing for the big deal 
almost since he was appointed chief executive five years ago. 
Now, as leader of the smaller of the two prospective partners, he appears to have abandoned the idea, and if he 
is relegated to a secondary role at the enlarged group, there must be doubts about how long he will stay. 
Even if the dynasties linger, there is no doubt in the industry that the era of the old-style vertically-integrated 
company is drawing to a close: but first, the players have to get bigger if they are to survive the transformation. 
Today's shocks - including the lowest New York market price for oil since quotes were started in 1983 - have 
played their part in recent restructuring which started with collaboration in refining and marketing, led to August's 
ground-breaking merger of British Petroleum and Amoco, and will now surely lead on to a wholesale shake-out. 
Evidence has been mounting that US companies have almost reached the limit of how deeply they can cut into 
operating costs and exploration and development expenditure without compromising their future. Texaco, for 
example, reviewed its exploration division recently and found only 1,000 jobs it could cut. 
But cost/price pressure is only part of the process which is driving international oil companies, which have hitherto 
stood aloof from one another and the merger frenzy which has transformed almost every other industrial sector in 
the past 10 years. 
The formation of multinational powerhouses in everything from cars to gas turbines has increasingly captured 
investors' attention and funds. Energy companies, once the most trustworthy source of dividends and now among 
the least profitable businesses in the world, have lost favour at a time when they need it most. 
Exploitation of vast resources in the former communist bloc and Asia is expected to demand expertise and capital 
on an unprecedented scale. The potential rewards are enormous, but they are likely to come only in the 
long-term, but geographical factors and the political risks involved present challenges only the biggest and 
strongest will be able to take on with relative security. 
The Exxon/Mobil deal demonstrates even more clearly than the BP/Amoco merger, approved by shareholders 
yesterday, that tradition and pride in historical doings - both prospective partners can look back for well over 100 
years - are meaningless in the modern marketplace.

Perhaps surprisingly, the realisation has dawned late in north America. But Mr Bijur's musings at the World 
Energy Council congress in Houston this summer, showed that the message had arrived. 
Reflecting on the future of the traditional business of refining and retailing petrol, he said there was no reason to 
doubt that even though US gasoline was still commonly available for $1 a gallon, low-fuel-consumption vehicles 
now capturing markets in Japan and Europe would come to north America - and far more quickly than many now 
suspect, Mr Bijur added. 
But Mr Bijur had an even more daunting view to present to the leading lights of the world energy industry. That 
was the prospect of the "traditional" heavyweight corporation being displaced by athoroughly modern business 
dedicated to providing services and solutions to oil-rich countries in return for a slice of the profits. 
In that scenario, refining could become as much a stand-alone business as power generation is becoming in 
increasingly deregulated electricity markets. The dirty work would be left to the nations that owned the resources, 
and the traditional companies would earn profits with their brain power. And it could all come to pass before the 
new century is a decade old.
