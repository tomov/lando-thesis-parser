NEW YORK, Dec 29 (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. telecommunications company AT&T Inc. said on Friday it had closed 
its estimated $85.8 billion acquisition of BellSouth Corp after receiving final approval from U.S. regulators. 
AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Edward Whitacre will continue to serve in the same roles at the combined 
company. Three members of the former BellSouth board of directors have joined the AT&T board -- Reuben 
Anderson, James Blanchard and James Kelly. 
AT&T said it plans to repatriate 3,000 jobs currently outsourced by BellSouth outside of the United States.

WASHINGTON, Dec 29, 2006 (AFP) - 
US regulators gave final approval Friday to AT and T's takeover of rival BellSouth, the biggest 
telecommunications merger in US history, saying it will lead to "significant public interest benefits." 
The companies immediately said they had finalized the deal that establishes "a premier global communications 
company committed to driving convergence, continued innovation, and competition in the communications and 
entertainment market." 
The newly enlarged AT and T "will be an engine for innovation, competition, and growth for our customers at 
home and abroad," said AT and T chairman and chief executive Edward Whitacre. 
The Federal Communications Commission gave its approval to the deal after the companies agreed to major 
concessions to break a deadlock. 
The FCC, whose action followed approval by the US Justice Department earlier this year, said the deal would 
help speed deployment of high-speed Internet in key regions, increase competition for advanced television 
services, as well as improving wireless service and emergency and disaster response operations. 
The purchase, estimated at some 67 billion dollars when it was announced in March, and now worth some 85 
billion dollars at current stock prices, would create the biggest US telecom group at a time when the industry is 
shifting its focus to high-speed Internet, television and wireless. 
FCC Chairman Kevin Martin and commissioner Deborah Tate said the merger makes sense in an era of rapidly 
shifting technologies, with telecom, Internet and cable television companies all racing into the same market. 
"The telecommunications market continues to be a dynamic one. New technologies and services are continuing 
to transform every aspect of our lives," the statement said. 
"The merged ATT/BellSouth promises to offer consumers a wider array of IP (Internet protocol) enabled 
services, including voice, data, wireless, and video services. 
"In particular, the merger will enable the combined company to accelerate its deployment of broadband and IPTV 
in the BellSouth region. The merger also will enhance national security by creating a stronger and more efficient 
US supplier of critical communications capabilities." 
Telecom analyst Jeff Kagan agreed that the changing dynamics of technology justifies the deal, and now AT and 
T can compete with cable telephone giants such as Comcast. 
He said 2007 "will change the industry on a competitive level. Telephone companies and cable television 
companies are gearing up to compete in the biggest all-or-nothing battle we have ever seen." 
AT and T announced Thursday that, in the face of opposition of some FCC members, it would agree to changes 
in its plan, including allowing customers to obtain "standalone" high-speed Internet service at a low cost. 
The company also agreed to adopt the principle of "Net Neutrality" which means it would not block or charge 
extra fees for Web services or sites, such as those operated by Google and Yahoo.

Page 6 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
AT and T said it agreed to the changes "in order to break the impasse" even though some of the demands from 
merger opponents are still being debated in Congress and by other agencies. 
The company further agreed to repatriate 3,000 jobs that are currently outsourced by BellSouth outside of the 
US, and hire at least 200 people in the New Orleans area which is rebuilding from Hurricane Katrina. 
It will offer the slowest broadband Internet access on a standalone basis for about 20 dollars a month, easing 
concerns it might have too much clout and force consumers into more expensive service bundles. 
The merger creates a company with 70 million phone customers and 10 million high-speed Internet users. It also 
has about 315,000 employees -- though that number is expected to fall -- and combined revenue of an estimated 
121 billion dollars. 
The deal gives AT and T full control of Cingular Wireless, the largest US mobile operator, up to now jointly owned 
with BellSouth. 
The deal puts back together much of the "Ma Bell" empire broken up in the 1980s. 
But the merger has also drawn fire from consumer groups and others who claim it will limit competition and give 
the combined company too much control of the Internet. 
FCC Commissioner Michael Kopps, who held out for several weeks before joining in Friday's 4-0 vote, said the 
deal was helped by the last-minute concessions. 
"We celebrate today not a triumph for huge corporate mergers but a modest victory for American consumers," 
Kopps said. 
"I believe that we have made this transaction at least minimally acceptable to American consumers. It brings price 
reductions rather than price increases, more broadband rather than less, a free and open Internet rather than one 
rife with opportunities to degrade and limit, and numerous other safeguards and protections."

UPDATE 4-AT&T third-quarter earnings beat expectations 
UPDATE 4-AT&T third-quarter earnings beat expectations

(Adds analyst comment, share price history, details) 
NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. on Monday posted a better-than-expected rise in third-quarter profit, 
helped by strong growth in its wireless venture Cingular and merger-related cost savings. 
The biggest U.S. telecoms carrier, formed through SBC Communications Inc.'s acquisition of AT&T Corp. last 
November, said profit, excluding merger-related costs and other special items, rose 58.2 percent from a year 
earlier to $2.4 billion, or 63 cents per share. 
That topped the average forecast of 58 cents per share from analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. 
Despite the higher-than-expected results, AT&T's shares rose only modestly on the New York Stock Exchange as 
investors had already pushed up the stock by 2 percent last Friday, when Cingular reported strong results. 
AT&T also said cost savings helped profit growth, and the company had cut 3,600 jobs in the third quarter, 
reaching a head count reduction of 10,500 so far this year. 
While that vindicated the company's merger strategy, some analysts said it also suggested that AT&T's core 
business was not growing as strongly as the bottom line suggested. 
"The numbers were slightly better than expected. Certainly the Cingular numbers were good. But cost-cutting was 
a major factor," said Surterre Research analyst Todd Rethemeier, who has a "hold" rating on the stock. 
The company said primary consumer lines fell by 242,000 in the third quarter, and analysts said consumers were 
continuing to shift to wireless phones and all-in-one packages of voice, video and Internet offered by cable 
television providers. 
"Looking at the line losses, it seems there is some competitive impact from cable companies," Rethemeier said. 
WIRELESS GROWTH 
AT&T is preparing to merge with BellSouth Corp. , a move that would consolidate its ownership of Cingular and 
reinforce its position as the biggest U.S. telecoms service provider. The U.S. Federal Communications 
Commission has scheduled a Nov. 3 meeting to vote on the merger. 
"Wireless delivered impressive margin expansion along with strong subscriber and revenue growth," said AT&T 
Chairman and Chief Executive Edward Whitacre. 
Analysts also expect Verizon Communications Inc. to post strong quarterly results since its wireless venture, 
along with Cingular, appears to be taking market share from Sprint Nextel Corp. . 
AT&T's consolidated revenue, which does not include sales from its 60 percent stake in Cingular, totaled $15.6 
billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from a pre-merger $10.3 billion in the third quarter of 2005. 
Net income was $2.2 billion, up 73.8 percent from the year-ago quarter, or 56 cents per share. That included 
costs from SBC Communications' acquisition of AT&T Corp. and from Cingular Wireless' purchase of AT&T 
Wireless.

Page 8 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The company said Internet subscriptions also helped to bolster sales. High-speed Internet subscribers increased 
25.5 percent from a year earlier to 8.2 million. 
AT&T is also aiming to compete with cable companies by expanding its high-definition video service in a plan 
called Project Lightspeed. The Internet-based video service will be expanded to around 15 cities by the end of the 
year. It had previously targeted 15 to 20 cities by the end of 2006. 
The $5 billion investment, while smaller than a similar project by Verizon, has raised concerns about costs. 
"We continue to have concerns about a looming capital expenditure increase commitment to the business, if 
Project Lightspeed proves incapable of providing a competitive consumer video offering on a wide scale across 
AT&T's footprint," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher King, who recommends selling AT&T stock. 
AT&T shares fell briefly in early trading before recovering to rise 29 cents, or 0.87 percent, to $34.73 on the New 
York Stock Exchange late Monday afternoon. The shares have risen around 40 percent so far this year.

US-based fixed-line operator AT&T has announced its Q206 results stating that profits had risen by 81% over the 
year to US$1.81mn. This result occurs on the back of its integration with SBC Communications, and positive 
contributions from its shared joint venture mobile unit Cingular Wireless, which reported its strongest net profit 
quarter ever. As for revenues, this rose by 53% y-o-y to US$10.3bn, largely attributed again to the inclusion of the 
merger. A breakdown in revenue shows that the bulk continued to derive from voice services, with a 54.5% share, 
although down from a share of 55.8% in the previous year, as data revenues continued to see the strongest 
growth. Data accounted for 28.3% of total revenues for Q206, against 23.6% in Q205, marking a rise of 4.7 
percentage points. 
The operator is set to buy out BellSouth later this year, which will see AT&T attain full control over Cingular 
Wireless, in which it has a 60% stake. The mobile unit has been selling off its overseas operations in recent 
months, as it tries to focus on its domestic US mobile market, which is currently undergoing a period of 
consolidation. 
AT&T CEO Edward Whitacre said: "We delivered another strong quarter, with excellent growth in both earnings 
and cash flow. These results demonstrate strong momentum as we look forward to the second half of the year 
and completion of our pending acquisition of BellSouth."

AT&T reported a 53 per cent rise in second quarter earnings to $0.46 a share as profits from a merger last year 
fed into the company's overall results. 
The largest American telecoms network, which was called SBC until it merged with AT&T in November, produced 
$1.8bn net income in the quarter, up 80.8 per cent on last year's figure, which predated the merger. 
AT&T still produced a 34.9 per cent rise in net profits to 58 cents per share, or $2.3bn, compared to last year's 
results adjusted to be comparable and excluding costs of the mergers. This beat Wall Street estimates, according 
to Thomson, of 53 cents a share. 
Combined operating revenue surged 53 per cent to $15.8bn from $10.3bn last year. The year-ago results do not 
include the operations of the former AT&T. 
The company was lifted in particular by Cingular Wireless' strong results, as it added 1.5m subscribers to reach 
57.3m in total, and turnover of customers fell for the third quarter running. This helped to offset a decline in 
telephone lines by 320,000 as consumers increasingly chose to move to wireless, or mobile phones, rather than 
land lines. 
Satellite television connections, a new and growing part of AT&T's business that pits them in competition with 
traditional cable TV operators, added 42,000 customers to reach 533,000. 
"Our SBC/AT&T merger integration projects are very much on plan generating synergies and benefiting 
customers," said Edward Whitacre, chief executive. 
He also announced a plan to "ramp up" share repurchases to $10bn by the end of 2007, with $2-3bn planned for 
this year. 
On Friday, shareholders approved the $67bn acquisition of Bellsouth, and AT&T hopes to receive regulatory 
approval this autumn.

AT&T will accept conditions in BellSouth deal

AT&T Inc. Chairman Edward Whitacre last week told the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee he would not 
oppose conditions on special access lines as part of any regulatory approval of the company's proposed $67 
billion purchase of BellSouth Corp. 
Whitacre told the Senate panel he would agree to restrictions on special access lines-dedicated lines used by 
wireless carriers to transmit calls from base stations to mobile switching centers-in areas where AT&T and 
BellSouth overlap. Whitacre initially said robust competition negates any need for merger conditions. The FCC 
instituted a similar safeguard in approving SBC Communications Inc. acquisition of AT&T Corp. 
Last week T-Mobile USA Inc. echoed previous comments from Sprint Nextel Corp. that the deal could impact 
competition. 
``Throughout these large service areas (served by the merger aspirants), T-Mobile depends on AT&T and 
BellSouth for special access services that are critical inputs to T-Mobile's competitive wireless offerings,'' stated 
the No. 4 national mobile-phone operator. ``The proposed merger will significantly degrade what little competition 
remains in the special access marketplace. Such competition is already depleted due to the recent loss of MCI 
(acquired by Verizon Communications Inc.) and AT&T as independent providers of special access.'' 
Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio), chairman of the Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, suggested an AT&T-BellSouth 
merger could chill the creation of a third broadband pipe . 
``The development of the so-called WiMAX service means cellular companies will be able to provide an 
alternative to the traditional phone and cable TV companies for video and Internet offerings. However, there is 
some concern that this merger will consolidate so much wireless spectrum in the hands of AT&T that it may 
hinder the development of WiMAX and diminish its potential as a competitive alternative,'' DeWine said. 
``We don't have all that much spectrum,'' said Whitacre. He described AT&T-60 percent owner of Cingular 
Wireless L.L.C.-as having a de minimus [minor] amount of broadband spectrum. BellSouth holds a 40 percent 
stake in Cingular. 
``We use that spectrum. We don't warehouse it,'' said Whitacre. 
However, Jonathan Rubin, senior research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told lawmakers he had a 
different take on BellSouth's Wi-MAX trial plans after many years of allowing its wireless broadband spectrum to 
lay idle. ``To me, I think that's warehousing,'' said Rubin. 
Several consumer groups agreed in an FCC filing. 
``These [2.3 GHz and 2.5 GHz] spectrum resources could be put to productive use by one or more independent 
firms to provide broadband services in competition with AT&T and BellSouth,'' stated Consumer Federation of 
America, Consumers Union, Free Press and U.S. Public Interest Research Group. ``The applicants' apparent 
warehousing of spectrum resources is yet another anticompetitive practice which must be stopped whether or not 
the merger is allowed to proceed.'' 
One subcommittee member voiced concern about the implications of an AT&T-BellSouth merger on growing 
competition between landline telephone companies and mobile phone carriers.

``The merger would also put Cingular, the nation's largest wireless provider, in the hands of the largest wireline 
company. So much for competition between wireless and wireline companies. Where will it end?'' asked Sen. 
Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), top minority member of the full Judiciary Committee. 
Thursday's hearing was overshadowed by testy exchanges between Senate Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter 
(R-Pa.) and Whitacre over the telecom executive's refusal to answer questions about whether AT&T was sharing 
customer data with the National Security Agency as part of its anti-terrorist surveillance program. 
``Senator, we follow the law,'' Whitacre said when Specter repeatedly questioned asked about reports of AT&T's 
cooperation with NSA. Whitacre did let out he was advised not to answer questions relating to the NSA program 
as it involves confidential information.

AT&T to Offer Web-TV, Broadband to Less Affluent

AT&T to Offer Web-TV, Broadband to Less Affluent

AT&T Inc., which has been criticized by cable rivals for targeting affluent households in its plans to launch an 
Internet-based television service, said it will offer the service to 5.5 million low-income households within three 
years. 
In a speech yesterday to the Detroit Economic Club, Edward Whitacre, AT&T's chairman and chief executive, 
also announced a deal with WildBlue Communications Inc. to provide broadband service to rural areas via 
satellite. Elected officials and government regulators have been pressuring phone companies to expand their 
high-speed Internet offers. 
Both moves are signs of the political battles AT&T, San Antonio, is waging as it competes with cable operators to 
offer consumers the most attractive packages of TV, voice and high-speed Internet services. One of the main 
arguments that cable operators have used against AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc., New York, is that the 
phone companies are focusing on affluent areas when rolling out their new TV offerings. 
Mr. Whitacre said the company will offer its service to 5.5 million low-income households in 41 markets within 
three years. In the past, AT&T has said it plans to reach nearly 19 million households with TV service in its 
13-state region by 2008. The company is expected to expand its TV offerings to the southern states in BellSouth 
Corp.'s home territory if its planned $67 billion takeover of BellSouth is approved by regulators. 
So far AT&T has launched TV service to only a small number of customers in San Antonio, though it plans to 
expand the offering in coming months. Verizon is farther along, having rolled out TV to dozens of communities in 
Texas, New York, Virginia and elsewhere. 
Phone companies such as AT&T and Verizon are increasingly relying on speedy Internet service to form the 
backbone of their offerings rather than traditional phone service, which is a shrinking business as customers turn 
to wireless and less-expensive Internet calling. 
In a further step in this direction, Verizon yesterday announced it had bought a stake in online-videogame 
company Super Computer International Inc. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. 
Mr. Whitacre said starting this month AT&T would begin using satellite and new fixed wireless technologies to 
offer broadband service to households in rural areas that can't get it over phone lines. 
The WildBlue satellite service, starting at $49.95 a month, will be more expensive than traditional broadband from 
phone companies and won't be as fast as their fastest offerings. The venture with WildBlue represents a potential 
breakthrough for the U.S. satellite industry, which has offered Internet connections for years but until now never 
had the support of a major partner with such deep pockets and marketing clout. 
Cable companies are trying to delay phone companies in their TV rollouts by trying to get local governments to 
force them to make service available to all residents, not just select areas. A recent report from Broadband 
Everywhere, a group aligned with the cable industry, said that more than 90% of communities where phone 
companies are rolling out the fiber that delivers TV are above the national median income. 
AT&T spokesman Michael Coe said the pledge to serve low-income customers was "an attempt to show those 
critics they're incorrect in assumptions they've made." A Verizon spokesman called the red-lining charges 
"nonsense" and said that low-income households are among the best customers.

In his speech, Mr. Whitacre also said AT&T has developed a technology that would allow customers to register 
the sound of their voices to be used as a form of identification when making Internet purchases. It could help 
online retailers fight credit-card fraud, he said.

When the government broke up Ma Bell more than 20 years ago, it did so because it did not want one company 
controlling computer-to-computer communication-at the time the stuff of science fiction. As Ma Bell is nearly 
reborn in the form of AT&T Inc. buying BellSouth Corp. for $67 billion, the concept of computers talking to each 
other is commonplace. How well they communicate could become a central concern of policymakers as 
consumer advocates push for network neutrality. 
Network neutrality in broad terms means the ability to run any lawful application or connect any lawful device to 
the communications network. For content providers, it means not being required to pay pipe owners-even if the 
pipe is spectrum-to have their content carried or given priority. 
``We expect advocates of network-neutrality obligations to try to convince the Federal Communications 
Commission and the Department of Justice to place strong conditions on the merged entity,'' said Stifle, Nicolaus 
& Co. Inc., in an equity research report, ``Network Neutrality: Value Chain Tug of War.'' ``AT&T and BellSouth 
will have to be on good behavior, as any effort to use their network ownership in a way that is seen as blocking or 
degrading the services of competitors could lead to greater momentum for merger conditions.'' 
The proposed acquisition also pushed network neutrality front and center as House Commerce Committee 
negotiators try to hammer out a telecom reform bill, which could be introduced as early as this week. 
While opponents of network neutrality believe advocates are warning of a non-existent problem, Gigi Sohn, 
president & co-founder of Public Knowledge, an advocacy group engaged in the debate, said last week, ``the 
companies are saying they are going to (block) do it. If that is not a threat, what do you need?'' 
Indeed, both Edward Whitacre, AT&T chief executive officer, and Duane Ackerman, BellSouth CEO, have said 
in the past that charging companies like Google Inc. and Vonage Holdings Corp. is the wave of the future. 
Wireless carriers already have such arrangements with their walled gardens, but those gardens were created in 
the day when wireless Internet was slow and cumbersome. As third-generation networks and phones capable of 
accessing the World Wide Web become the norm, wireless too must decide its views on network neutrality. ``The 
debate on net neutrality is really a debate over market power,'' said James Gattuso of the Heritage Foundation.

(Distributed for Investrend Communications, Inc. via M2 Communications Ltd ( www.m2.com March 13, 2006- 
(FinancialWire) After offering $65 billion to acquire BellSouth Corp. (NYSE: BLS), AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) faces 
serious workforce and network integration hurdles just a three months removed from the SBC merger. The 
appetite for acquisitions in the telecommunications industry has not always had a happy ending. WorldCom 
acquired some 70 smaller Telco s before trying to reinvent itself as MCI prior to collapse and bankruptcy in 2002. 
MCI was later acquired by AT&T rival Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) Together AT&T and BellSouth would 
deliver data and long-distance services coast-to-coast according to reports. The maneuver will also bring Cingular 
Wireless, a joint venture between BellSouth and AT&T, under one roof. 
Some analysts questions whether or not AT&T can squeeze roughly $18 billion in new synergies out of a merged 
company, but AT&T argues that the illumination of some 10,000 redundant positions along with a decline in some 
SG&A expenses could allow the company to leverage vendor pricing and capitalize on any newly integrated data 
and telecommunications networks. For an industry with as many consumer touch points as telecommunications, 
the strain of integrating billing platforms and customer facing sales and support programs can reportedly pose a 
daunting task. Just ask WorldCom. "This merger is a logical next step that creates substantial value for customers 
and stockholders of both AT&T and BellSouth," stated AT&T Chairman and CEO Edward Whitacre eight days 
ago. "It will benefit customers through new services and expanded service capabilities." For up-to-the-minute

AT&T Inc. has acquired rival BellSouth Corp., the largest telephone provider in the Southeast, for $67 billion in 
stock (see analysis, page 1). If approved by shareholders, the merged company would have 70 million local-line 
phone customers and nearly 10 million broadband subscribers. The merger would streamline the ownership and 
operations of Cingular Wireless, now jointly owned by AT&T and BellSouth. AT&T chairman and CEO Edward 
Whitacre would serve as chairman, CEO and member of the board of the combined company. Duane Ackerman, 
chairman and CEO of BellSouth, would be chairman and CEO of BellSouth's operations during the merger 
transition.

Alarm call for AT&T

Alarm call for AT&T

Just as the telecoms giant expands into new territories, competitors are taking the battle to its own patch 
Edward Whitacre has a thing about aeroplane hangars. The chief executive of AT&T has cut a lot of deals in 
these cavernous confines, including his $61bn (£35bn) purchase of internet service Ameritech. So when Whitacre 
and BellSouth's chief executive, Duane Ackerman, were getting close to finalising AT&T's proposed $67bn 
acquisition, the two boarded their corporate jets and flew to a nondescript hangar in Memphis. No deal lieutenants 
were there. No lawyers or bankers. Just Ed and Duane. They worked the deal out on notepads and shook hands. 
The long-anticipated acquisition looks like a coup for the telecoms veteran. Since the Telecommunications Act of 
1996 cracked the door to competition, Whitacre has aggressively refashioned his regional telephone monopoly, 
formerly SBC Communications, into a vast global player. He renamed the company AT&T after acquiring the 
long-distance icon last autumn. The Bell-South deal still needs the blessing of shareholders and regulators. But if 
it's approved, as expected, Whitacre will have created the largest telecoms provider in the world, with $120bn in 
revenues and a market cap of $165bn. 
He's betting that size and scale will allow him to seize the crown in his industry. His primary motivation for the 
latest deal was to get full control of Cingular Wireless, the country's largest wireless provider, now a joint venture 
between AT&T and BellSouth. 
In addition, he figures that with the biggest phone company in the land, he will benefit from economies of scale, 
providing the cash to push into new markets and develop innovative products. 
The deal "will create a strong national and global competitor, better positioned to deliver new services to both 
businesses and consumers," he says. 
But his industry is changing at the speed of light, creating challenges and pitfalls for the would-be king. In market 
after market, his company is under siege from rivals. The raging competition is transforming the telecoms industry 
to the point that its very name is becoming obsolete. Cable companies such as Comcast and internet players like 
Google are pouring into the telephone business, while AT&T and its peers are moving into everything from cable 
television to computer security. 
The challenges facing Whitacre won't go away with one more deal. His company has dim prospects for growth, 
with revenue rises expected to average less than 1 per cent for the next five years. Worse, the business that's 
being picked apart by rivals such as Comcast is the traditional fixed-line phone one, with the rich margins that 
come from a near-monopoly. Meanwhile, the areas that AT&T is moving into, including wireless and cable TV, are 
much more competitive. 
Things are only going to get harder. Analyst Anthony Noto of Goldman Sachs believes that companies such as 
AT&T could lose 40 per cent of their landline residential customers over the next 10 years. 
The BellSouth deal risks becoming a distraction from the task at hand. Over the coming months, Whitacre will 
have to do battle with consumer groups and rivals who want to stop the acquisition or impose heavy conditions on 
its approval.

Page 19 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
If the deal closes, he'll then have to take on a gigantic integration task, one that includes melding the acquisitions 
of AT&T Wireless and AT&T. The latter deal closed only five months ago. "The difficulty grows mightily as you 
layer transaction on top of transaction," says David Barden, a Bank of America analyst. 
Whitacre's chief competition comes from the cable firms. By bundling together TV, broadband and internet phone 
services, they're swiping customers from AT&T across the country. They have also struck a partnership with 
Sprint Nextel, allowing them to offer wireless services. 
These rivals say Whitacre now has to defend the traditional phone businesses in two regions: his own and 
BellSouth's. "They're bigger, but their problem is that they're more exposed to cable and wireless competition," 
says Sprint's chief executive, Gary Foresee. 
Whitacre wants to counter the threat by making his own wireless company more powerful. After all, wireless is the 
fastest-growing segment in telecoms. Although Cingular is the largest provider in the US, with $34bn in revenues, 
it lags behind Verizon Wireless in profitability and customer retention. 
Whitacre figures that full control of Cingular will allow him to move more decisively. In recent months, BellSouth 
and AT&T have clashed over a variety of issues, including whether AT&T would be able to sell a wireless phone 
under its own brand using the Cingular network. While AT&T hoped to bundle wireless with phone and broadband 
services more easily, BellSouth resisted. "They sometimes really struggled to get agreement," says an industry 
consultant close to the companies. Now, Cingular will take the AT&T name. 
Another of Whitacre's big bets is on television services. He is laying fibre lines that can carry TV signals 
throughout his territory - an initiative he will carry into BellSouth's region. The idea is to go after the same cable 
firms that are offering phone services, so AT&T can match their bundles. But the initiative is hugely expensive. 
AT&T is spending $5bn to upgrade its own networks, and analysts expect it will pay at least $2bn on BellSouth's 
network. 
Tough times? Maybe. But Whitacre has never been one to shy away from a tussle. In 2004, when he was trying 
to buy AT&T Wireless, a crisis hit. He thought he had the deal in hand when he got a late-night phone call from 
his lawyers. They told him Vodafone had outbid him by 50 cents a share. 
Whitacre didn't blink. He woke up every member of SBC'sboard of directors for a teleconference at 1.30 in the 
morning. He then pushed for approval to up SBC's bid by $1 a share, or around $3bn. The board quickly agreed. 
This time, Whitacre is facing what is likely to be his last big challenge. He was expected to step down as chief 
executive this autumn, after reaching his company's retirement age of 65. But now he will stick around until March 
2008, to run the combined companies for at least a year. 
"I never had designs on being the biggest," says Whitacre. "I just want to be the best company."

Announced Date: 3/6/2006 AT&T and BellSouth Corporation have announced an agreement to merge the two 
companies. 
The merger will streamline the ownership and operations of Cingular Wireless, which is jointly owned by AT&T 
and BellSouth. The new company will combine the Cingular, BellSouth and AT&T networks into a single 
integrated wireless and wireline IP network. 
As AT&T and BellSouth are not competitors in the local, long distance and video markets, and because 
BellSouth is not a significant competitor with AT&T in the enterprise market, the merger will not reduce 
competition in those markets. 
Under terms of the agreement, approved by the boards of directors of both companies, shareholders of 
BellSouth will receive 1.325 shares of AT&T common stock for each common share of BellSouth. Based on 
AT&T's closing stock price on March 3, 2006, this exchange ratio equals $37.09 per BellSouth common share. 
This represents a 17.9% premium over BellSouth's closing stock price on March 3, 2006, and a total equity 
consideration currently valued at approximately $67 billion. 
The merger, which is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies, as well as regulatory authorities and 
to other customary closing conditions, is expected to close within approximately 12 months. 
AT&T and BellSouth expect the proposed transaction to yield substantial benefits for stockholders of both 
companies. 
The merger combines three companies that currently operate separately and independently: AT&T, BellSouth 
and Cingular Wireless.AT&T and BellSouth estimate that synergies from the combination will ramp quickly to 
reach an annual run rate exceeding $2 billion in the second year after closing, and estimate the net present value 
of expected synergies at nearly $18 billion. 
A substantial portion of synergies are expected to come from reduced costs in the operations of unregulated and 
interstate services, and corporate staff, and are over and above expected productivity improvements from the 
companies' ongoing initiatives. 
Approximately half of the total cost savings are expected to come from network operations and IT, as facilities 
and operations are consolidated and traffic is moved to a single IP network. Additional savings are expected to 
come from combining staff functions and from reduced ongoing advertising and branding expenses. 
AT&T expects the transaction to be adjusted earnings-per-share neutral in 2007 and have a positive impact on its 
adjusted earnings per share thereafter (adjusted earnings per share exclude all merger integration costs and 
non-cash expenses for amortization of intangibles). AT&T does not expect that the merger will affect guidance it 
provided at its January 31, 2006, analyst conference. 
AT&T continues to expect double-digit adjusted EPS growth in each of the next three years, with growth in free 
cash flow after dividends. Free cash flow after dividends is expected to exceed $4 billion in 2007 and exceed $6 
billion in 2008. 
Total revenues, including Cingular, are expected to return to growth in 2007, a year earlier than previous 
guidance. Capital expenditures, including Cingular, are expected to be in the mid-teens as a percentage of 
revenues in 2007 and 2008.

Page 21 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The transaction is expected to improve AT&T's overall growth profile - driven by wireless, which will represent 
about one-third of the combined company's expected revenues in 2007 - and through expanded opportunities in 
business markets. 
AT&T expects free cash flow after dividends from the combined company to provide the flexibility to continue 
reducing debt levels over the next five years while providing cash returns to stockholders. 
AT&T's board of directors has approved an expanded share repurchase authorisation of 400 million shares 
through 2008, replacing the existing program. Under this authorisation, the company expects to buy back at least 
$10 billion of its common shares over the next 22 months. It expects at least $2 billion in repurchases during 
2006, consistent with its previous guidance, and an additional $8 billion in repurchases in 2007. 
This repurchase authorisation is intended to approximate the share premium paid to BellSouth stockholders as 
part of this merger transaction. The timing and nature of these repurchases will depend on market conditions and 
applicable securities laws. 
AT&T chairman and CEO Edward Whitacre will serve as chairman, CEO and a member of the board of directors 
of the combined company. His counterpart at BellSouth, Duane Ackerman, will serve as chairman and CEO of 
BellSouth operations for a transition period following the merger. In addition, three members of BellSouth's 
board of directors will join the AT&T board. 
The corporate headquarters for the combined company will remain in San Antonio. Cingular's headquarters will 
remain in Atlanta, as will the combined company's Southeast regional telephone company headquarters.

Over the years, AT&T Inc. Chairman Edward Whitacre and BellSouth Corp. Chief Executive Duane Ackerman 
had talked many times about a deal before they finally agreed to the largest one in the history of the U.S. 
telecommunications industry. 
In two years, though, both likely will be retired. 
Before the deal, Randall Stephenson, AT&T's chief operating officer, and Mark Feidler, who held the same title at 
BellSouth, were widely acknowledged to be the heirs apparent of their respective companies. While it is likely 
they will play significant leadership roles in the combined company, analysts and investors believe that Mr. 
Stephenson has the inside track to be chief executive. 
"Randall is clearly the anointed one within AT&T, and Mark as the No. 2 in BellSouth needs to know that he'll 
have to be No. 2 or 3 in the new entity," says a consultant who has worked with both companies. 
Both men declined to be interviewed. But people familiar with the situation say that Mr. Stephenson, who has 
spent his 24-year career with the company mainly overseeing telecom finances, and Mr. Feidler, a former 
corporate lawyer and investment banker, have both been supporters of a deal between BellSouth and AT&T. 
The two executives have a good working relationship and already have one deal in common. They both helped 
negotiate the Cingular Wireless acquisition of AT&T Wireless. BellSouth and AT&T own Cingular in a joint 
venture. 
Mr. Feidler, 49 years old, a graduate of Vanderbilt Law School who joined BellSouth in 1991, is known for getting 
into the nitty-gritty of the business. 
"Mark is probably the smartest guy in whatever room he's in. He's a strategic thinker with a giant brain," says a 
former consultant who has also worked with both companies. "Unfortunately, I don't think he has a shot at the top 
job." 
What has endeared Mr. Stephenson, 45, to Wall Street is a blunt and charismatic style. He has been a patient 
and competent sideman to Mr. Whitacre and is known for his rapid recall of matters at hand. Like Mr. Whitacre, 
he is a hands-on manager who focuses on the minutiae of his business. He is known as a gentleman and is 
popular with the upper echelon of management at AT&T. 
In an era of new regulations, many executives and companies have become tight-lipped and stick to scripts. But 
Mr. Stephenson, who holds a master's degree in accounting from the University of Oklahoma, always makes an 
effort to explain issues and to be as forthcoming as possible, analysts who have dealt with him say. 
A loyal lieutenant to Mr. Whitacre, Mr. Stephenson nevertheless pushed the company to change and was a 
proponent of the Cingular deal with BellSouth, the consultant said. He was also a proponent of AT&T's decision 
to have a presence in Hollywood near the content providers for its Internet television venture, Project Lightspeed, 
the consultant said. 
Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Feidler are energetic executives approaching the prime of their careers, but they must 
still answer to and take direction from a chief executive who is for now firmly in charge. Their roots are starkly 
different from Mr. Whitacre, 64, and Mr. Ackerman, 63, both of whom started at the bottom of the phone business, 
working on equipment in the field before ascending through the executive ranks.

Page 23 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
And as much as Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Feidler pushed for the deal between AT&T and BellSouth, it was still 
Mr. Whitacre who finally convinced Mr. Ackerman to sign. "Ed and Duane largely did the deals themselves. The 
key meetings were those guys one-on-one," said one person familiar with the deal. 
Mr. Ackerman and Mr. Whitacre share an affinity for one another's similar telecom backgrounds. After many 
attempts at a deal through the years, Mr. Ackerman relented because he found his company in somewhat of a 
pickle. SBC Communications had acquired AT&T Corp. and all its enterprise assets to become AT&T Inc., and 
Verizon Communications Inc. had taken over the business assets of MCI Inc. Suddenly, BellSouth had two major 
competitors that could sell a package of services to companies in its own backyard. The two men met a handful of 
times to discuss terms of the deal, but there wasn't much wrangling. Their companies' stocks have been trading 
at roughly similar prices, and because they had contemplated a deal for so long there wasn't much to haggle 
over. 
Mr. Whitacre has honed his skills at timing with many acquisitions through the years. His board members trust 
him implicitly, and he can assemble them rapidly if he wants to move fast on a deal. 
It has long been assumed that Mr. Ackerman would end his career by finally relinquishing his longstanding 
caution about the deal-making that has transformed the industry. Since the late 1990s, BellSouth flirted with 
several deals but always backed away. The company bid unsuccessfully against the former WorldCom Inc. for 
Sprint Corp. several years ago and later held talks with both MCI and AT&T Corp. 
Last year, according to people familiar with the situation, Mr. Ackerman approached Mr. Whitacre about a merger 
deal that would have split BellSouth into separate directories, landline and wireless businesses. Mr. Whitacre 
declined, these people say. Officials from the companies couldn't confirm that situation.

As chairman of the Federal Communications Commission during the Clinton administration, Reed Hundt killed 
talks about a possible merger in 1997 when he said a proposed deal between AT&T and SBC would be 
"unthinkable" under antitrust laws. 
Last year, those two companies combined with little resistance. And on Monday, Hundt said that AT&T's proposal 
to buy BellSouth for $67 billion was "eminently thinkable" and that if he were still at the commission, he "would 
bless the deal." 
His statement was a sign of how far the regulatory climate, as well as the market, has traveled in less than a 
decade as the cable and phone industries have gotten into each other's businesses and new forms of phone 
service have grown. 
While government officials and industry lobbyists say the AT&T- BellSouth deal faces few regulatory obstacles, 
those changes in the marketplace may bring different political headwinds. 
The deal threatens to undermine parts of the telephone industry's broader regulatory and legislative agenda by 
making it more difficult for the industry to argue that it needs relief from regulators and Congress. 
The Bell telephone companies have lobbied hard for the past year to get Congress to adopt a measure that would 
make it easier for them to offer video services. The phone companies want federal legislation that would pre-empt 
local authority over such services. The cable industry has fought equally hard against the measure. That fight is 
central to the telephone companies' new strategy of offering video service to compete directly with cable and 
satellite companies that offer paid television services. 
As Internet service providers, the large phone companies are involved in a political fight over whether they must 
offer equal access to all Web providers, an approach called "Net neutrality." Content providers like Google and 
Yahoo, and companies providing Internet-based phone service like Vonage, seek legislation to prevent phone 
companies from favoring their own Web sites and those offered by their partners over rivals and Internet phone 
companies. 
While the phone companies fight that move, they are also battling legislative efforts to make it easier for 
municipalities to offer free wireless Internet services. 
But the continued consolidation of the telephone industry that the latest deal contemplates gives the phone 
companies' opponents significant political leverage in all three debates and, for now, could make it harder for 
AT&T and Verizon, the two largest phone companies, to prevail on all fronts. 
"The reverberations at first will be subterranean, but they will be of earthquake proportions," Hundt said. 
The cable industry, awaiting regulatory approval of its own major consolidation in which Time Warner and 
Comcast expect to divide up Adelphia, was quick Monday to point out the perils of a consolidating telephone 
industry. But Verizon, signaling that it will not raise major objections to the BellSouth deal, issued a statement 
that called it "logical and predictable." And Kevin Martin, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, 
issued a noncommittal statement.

Page 25 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"The FCC's primary responsibility is to determine whether the proposed transaction is in the best interest of 
consumers," Martin said. The AT&T-BellSouth deal provides a vehicle for regulators and lawmakers to consider 
what to do in the "Net neutrality" debate and whether the telephone companies can charge more money for 
certain content providers. The issue came to national attention in November when Edward Whitacre Jr., the 
blunt-speaking leader of AT&T, complained in an interview in Business Week Online. 
"We and the cable companies have made an investment, and for Google or Yahoo or Vonage or anybody to 
expect to use these pipes free is nuts," he said. 
In the same interview, Whitacre was asked whether it was possible that his company would ever acquire 
BellSouth. 
"It sure would be nice, but it doesn't have much chance of happening because of market power, size, etc.," he 
replied. "I think it would be real hard to do. I don't think the regulators would let that happen, in my judgment." 
While AT&T seems to have overcome that concern, lobbyists and others in the industry said Monday that there 
would be pressure on regulators to impose conditions ensuring that consumers continue to have unfettered 
access to the Internet and precluding discrimination by AT&T against companies like Google and Yahoo. 
In the case of the video-franchise legislation, the telephone companies in recent weeks had begun to see 
progress on favorable legislation in the House of Representatives that could be derailed by the deal. Wasting no 
time, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, the cable industry organization, sent a letter 
Monday to top lawmakers arguing against legislation that would remove local control over the introduction of 
video services by the Bell companies. 
The cable industry, having put together its franchises city by city, contends that the phone companies should face 
the same hurdles for video delivery. 
"It is important to take stock of where we are in 2006," said the letter from Kyle McSlarrow, president of the 
association. "In the last decade, the Bell monopolies have all but wiped out their telephone competitors; they have 
swallowed their long-distance competitors; and with the announcement of the AT&T-BellSouth merger, they are 
on the verge of recreating Ma Bell. 
"And only one competitor really stands in their way: the cable industry."

Over the years, AT&T Inc. chairman Edward Whitacre and BellSouth Corp. chief executive Duane Ackerman 
had talked many times about a deal before they finally agreed to the largest one in the history of the U.S. 
telecommunications industry. 
In two years, though, both likely will be retired. 
Before the deal Randall Stephenson, AT&T's chief operating officer, and Mark Feidler, who held the same title at 
BellSouth, were widely acknowledged to be the heirs apparent of their respective companies once their bosses 
retire. While it is likely they will play significant leadership roles in the combined company, analysts and investors 
believe that Mr. Stephenson has the inside track to be chief executive. 
"Randall is clearly the anointed one within AT&T and Mark as the No. 2 in BellSouth needs to know that he'll 
have to be No. 2 or 3 in the new entity," says a consultant who has worked with both companies. 
Both men declined to be interviewed. But people familiar with the situation say that Mr. Stephenson, who has 
spent his 24-year career with the company mainly overseeing telecom finances, and Mr. Feidler, a former 
corporate lawyer and investment banker, have both been supporters of a deal between BellSouth and AT&T. 
The two executives have a good working relationship and already have one deal in common. They both helped 
negotiate the Cingular Wireless acquisition of AT&T Wireless. BellSouth and AT&T own Cingular in a joint 
venture. 
Mr. Feidler, 49 years old, a graduate of Vanderbilt Law School who joined BellSouth in 1991, is known for getting 
into the nitty-gritty of the business. Associates say he has an excellent, almost impish sense of humor. He isn't a 
practical joker but is known for his wit, and he makes it clear he doesn't take himself or his situation too seriously. 
"Mark is probably the smartest guy in whatever room he's in. He's a strategic thinker with a giant brain," says a 
former consultant who has also worked with both companies. "Unfortunately, I don't think he has a shot at the top 
job." 
What has endeared Mr. Stephenson, 45, to Wall Street is a blunt and charismatic style. He has been a patient 
and competent sideman to Mr. Whitacre and is known for his rapid recall of matters at hand. Like Mr. Whitacre, 
he is a hands-on manager who focuses on the minutiae of his business. He is known as a gentleman and is 
popular with the upper echelon of management at AT&T. 
In an era of new regulations, many executives and companies have become tight-lipped and stick to scripts. But 
Mr. Stephenson, who holds a master's degree in accounting from the University of Oklahoma, always makes an 
effort to explain issues and to be as forthcoming as possible, analysts who have dealt with him say. 
"He's not the kind of executive who says, `I'll get back to you on that,' " says one telecom analyst who has met 
with him frequently. 
A loyal lieutenant to Mr. Whitacre, Mr. Stephenson nevertheless pushed the company to change and was a 
proponent of the Cingular deal with BellSouth, the consultant said. He was also a proponent of AT&T's decision 
to have a presence in Hollywood near the content providers for its Internet television venture, Project Lightspeed, 
the consultant said. 
Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Feidler are energetic executives approaching the prime of their careers, but they must 
still answer to and take direction from a chief executive who is for now firmly in charge. Their roots are starkly

different from Mr. Whitacre, 64, and Mr. Ackerman, 63, both of whom started at the bottom of the phone business, 
working on equipment in the field, before ascending through the executive ranks. 
And as much as Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Feidler pushed for the deal between AT&T and BellSouth, it was still 
Mr. Whitacre who finally convinced Mr. Ackerman to sign. "Ed and Duane largely did the deals themselves. The 
key meetings were those guys one-on-one," said one person familiar with the deal. 
Mr. Ackerman and Mr. Whitacre have a great deal of respect for one another and share a cultural affinity for one 
another's similar telecom backgrounds. After many attempts at a deal through the years Mr. Ackerman finally 
relented because he found his company in somewhat of a pickle. SBC Communications had acquired AT&T 
Corp. and all its enterprise assets to become AT&T Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc. had taken over the 
business assets of MCI Inc. Suddenly, BellSouth had two major competitors that could sell a better package of 
services to companies in its own backyard. The two men met a handful of times to discuss terms of the deal, but 
there wasn't much wrangling. Their companies' stocks have been trading at roughly similar prices and because 
they had contemplated a deal for so long there wasn't much to haggle over. 
Mr. Whitacre is known as an operator. He is a master of the deal and a broker who has honed his skills at timing 
with many acquisitions through the years. His board members trust him implicitly and he can assemble them 
rapidly if he wants to move fast on a deal. 
It has long been assumed that the gentlemanly, restrained Mr. Ackerman would end his career by finally 
relinquishing his longstanding caution about the deal-making that has transformed the industry while BellSouth 
stayed close to its regional roots. Since the late 1990s BellSouth flirted with several deals but always backed 
away. The company bid unsuccessfully against the former WorldCom Inc. for Sprint Corp. several years ago and 
later held talks with both MCI and AT&T Corp.

THE CABLE INDUSTRY'S headache just got bigger. 
For more than two years, cable stocks have been under pressure on Wall Street. Shares of companies like 
Comcast Corp., Charter Communications Inc. and Mediacom Communications Corp. have steadily declined as 
investors watched cable's once near-monopoly in the television business get challenged by satellite-TV operators, 
phone companies and even videos on the Internet. Investors also have been concerned that cable's 
once-commanding lead in the sale of high-speed Internet connections also has eroded as telephone companies 
have steeply discounted competing offers. 
Now AT&T Inc.'s planned $67 billion acquisition of BellSouth Corp. could create the largest competitor yet for 
cable operators. Of all the regional phone companies, AT&T already was the most aggressive in its plans for 
rolling out television and discounting broadband service. Adding BellSouth's customers would push AT&T's 
annual sales to $120 billion in 22 U.S. states, giving the behemoth cash and scale to pursue these strategies on a 
national level. 
"We want a bigger footprint," says Edward Whitacre Jr., AT&T's chief executive. "The world is changing." 
This will likely put additional pressure on cable operators to either cut prices, in the case of high-speed Internet, or 
slow the growth of rate increases, in the case of television. Cable companies also may have to increase capital 
spending, a step they have been forced to take many times in the past, much to the frustration of investors. In 
November, Comcast's stock fell 5% after it raised its estimated 2005 capital spending to $3.5 billion from an 
earlier prediction of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. 
(Overall, Comcast, the U.S.'s largest cable operator, with more than 21 million subscribers, saw its stock fall 21% 
to finish the year at $27.18. In late-afternoon trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday, Comcast shares 
were off eight cents at $27.09.) 
At the same time, consolidation in the telephone industry will likely increase pressure on cable operators to get 
larger as well. Both Comcast and Time Warner Inc.'s cable unit are expected to grow later this year when they 
divide up the systems of Adelphia Communications Corp., which has been operating under bankruptcy protection. 
As part of that deal, Time Warner Cable will issue public stock, giving it a currency for acquisitions. 
Even before the AT&T merger with BellSouth was announced, the telecommunications landscape was in 
upheaval, a far cry from a decade ago, when cable operators enjoyed a near-monopoly in the pay-TV business. 
While telephone companies have been planning to move into the TV business, cable operators have been racing 
to offer phone service. Both have been slugging it out in the broadband business and late last year, a venture of 
Sprint Nextel Corp. and the largest cable operators in the U.S. announced plans to offer wireless service together. 
Cable and telephone companies believe the best way to win customers is to offer packages of 
telecommunications services that cost less than the total of what each one would cost individually, with the idea 
that consumers will like the idea of saving money as well as getting all their services on one bill. The strategy also 
holds that when consumers are getting a group of services from one company, it will be less vulnerable to 
marketing by the competition. 
To be sure, cable operators have been winning on some fronts recently. While major phone companies like 
AT&T, formerly SBC Communications Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc. have barely launched television

service, cable companies already provide phone service to more than five million U.S. subscribers. The 
cable-phone business is expected to grow even more this year because Comcast, the country's largest operator, 
is launching the service on a massive scale. 
Most large cable companies also have been more successful in increasing revenue than telephone companies 
have been. Comcast's 2005 revenue, for example, was $21.5 billion, up 9.5% from the previous year. Time 
Warner Cable chalked up revenue growth of 12% for a total of $9.5 billion. By comparison AT&T's pro forma 
revenue growth in 2005 was 7.5%, for a total of $43.9 billion. (That figure doesn't include revenue from SBC's 
acquisition of AT&T Corp.) 
"Cable operators have been able to prove their ability to compete and adapt to a changing environment," says 
Michael Willner, chief executive of Insight Communications Co., the country's ninth-largest cable operator. "The 
cable market is oversold [by Wall Street] because of unwarranted fears." 
But clouds are forming on the horizon of the cable industry's growth outlook. In the broadband business, the 
strategy of telephone companies to buy market share through steep discounting seems to be succeeding. Last 
year was the first full year that telephone companies added more subscribers, 5.2 million, than cable operators, 
4.4 million, according to Leichtman Research Group Inc. They did this primarily by cutting prices to $14.95 a 
month, in the case of AT&T's current offer. Cable operators charge roughly $45 a month for broadband service. 
Cable executives point out that their reluctance to cut prices has kept their profit margins in their broadband 
business much higher than those reported by telephone companies. But telephone-company officials counter that 
they will win in the long run by buying market share through discounting because consumers are reluctant to 
switch broadband providers once they have a working connection. 
Telephone companies also enjoy a clear edge in the wireless business, which also is part of the package that 
cable companies want to offer. A merger of AT&T and BellSouth would strengthen AT&T's hand in wireless 
because the companies are co-owners of Cingular Wireless. With a single owner, Cingular will likely be even 
more competitive, freed up from the inevitable conflicts that occur when a company has to serve two masters. 
Meanwhile, the cable industry's venture with Sprint shows early signs of growing pains. When it was announced 
late last year, executives predicted that service would be launched in the first half of 2006. Now, they are saying it 
will be in the second half of this year. A spokeswoman for the venture, Melinda Tiermeyer, says that it involves 
numerous companies and requires "a lot of different areas coming together" like marketing, retail and the actual 
product. 
Even more concerning for some investors is the prospect of more competition in the video business, which is the 
source of more than 70% of their revenue. The satellite industry, which has more than 27 million subscribers, 
already has demonstrated the vulnerability of cable operators. Satellite continues to pose a formidable threat, with 
Rupert Murdoch's DirecTV Group Inc. planning to offer more than 150 national high-definition channels by 2007, 
as well as 1,500 local high-definition channels, surpassing what most cable companies can currently offer. 
AT&T executives claim they will offer a superior TV service than cable operators because they are using Internet 
technology to deliver the signal. This will give AT&T the ability to offer an unlimited amount of content because 
unlike traditional cable technology, which sends all channels to a set at once, Internet technology sends programs 
individually. 
Also, Internet technology eventually will likely allow AT&T to offer a wide range of new features that combine 
phone, broadband and TV services. These features probably will include new forms of interactive commercials, 
which are becoming more desirable to advertisers because of the growing number of viewers who are 
fast-forwarding through traditional ads with TiVos and other digital video recorders. 
Before it announced its plans to buy BellSouth, AT&T said it plans to offer its own television service to 18 million 
homes by the first half of 2008. AT&T also is planning to beef up its alliance with satellite-TV operator EchoStar 
Communications Corp. by offering consumers a service, named HomeZone, that combines satellite TV with 
movies, programs and other so-called on-demand content off the Internet. 
What is still unclear, of course, is whether AT&T will be able to execute its TV plans. So far, it is only offering its 
Internet service in San Antonio, and some experts are skeptical that AT&T will be able to move ahead with a 
broad rollout later this year. AT&T and EchoStar already are months behind in their plans to launch HomeZone. 
Also, cable operators aren't standing still waiting for telephone companies to come out with a better mousetrap. 
Comcast, for example, has greatly increased its video-on-demand offerings with ambitious plans to offer as many

Page 30 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
as 10,000 movies, programs and other features, many of them free. Large cable operators also are pushing 
forward with a wide range of other new technologies that will give them interactive commercials and many of the 
other features that AT&T is planning. 
"There's not a thing that [TV using Internet technology] can offer that we can't offer to our customers as well," 
says Steve Burke, Comcast's chief operating officer. 
Cable operators also are hopeful that, at least in the short term, a merger of AT&T and BellSouth would slow 
AT&T's launch of TV service. They point out that for months, if not years, management's attention will likely be 
focused on integrating the two companies. 
But, in the long run, the BellSouth acquisition will likely make AT&T a more formidable competitor in the TV 
business. Until now, BellSouth executives haven't committed themselves to rolling out TV service, uncertain that 
the investment was worth it. But with AT&T in charge, BellSouth's networks will become part of AT&T's TV 
strategy. 
In competing against mainstream network television, which is beholden to federal decency standards because the 
signals travel over government-granted airwaves, the cable industry quickly built up its subscriber base and 
began winning accolades and industry awards in the U.S. for cutting-edge shows like "The Sopranos" and "Sex 
and the City." 
But cable operators have suffered setbacks in the converging worlds of telecommunications and media, where 
their competitors increasingly are the better-connected telephone giants, who have maneuvered through the 
federal legislative and regulatory landscape for decades. 
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin has taken a stronger stance with the cable industry 
than with its telecom counterparts. Under his oversight, the FCC has undertaken at least three major reviews that 
have significant implications for the cable industry, including requiring operators to offer consumers an "a la carte" 
lineup, rather than a package of channels, as well as cap cable companies ability to extend their reach through 
mergers with other cable companies, as the phone companies are doing. 
The cable industry has also been fighting off multiple attacks on its core business this year in Washington -- from 
the regional phone companies known as Bells, as well as some members of Congress and the FCC, who are 
eager to extend indecency rules over cable programming and forcing companies to offer channels individually, 
instead of in prepackaged bundles. 
As soon as this week, key House lawmakers could release a draft of a legislation that would help clear the way 
for the Bells to get into the cable-television business. Essentially, the bill is expected to establish national video 
franchises, which would allow the phone companies to avoid having to seek permission from local governments 
to offer video service in their communities. BellSouth and Verizon have been pressing lawmakers to consider a 
narrowly focused telecom bill that only addresses the video-franchising issue, although they haven't had much 
success yet in the Senate.

declined, these people say. Officials from neither company could confirm that situation. Mr. Whitacre was 
unhappy when BellSouth tried to pursue a takeover of AT&T, people familiar with that situation say. Mr. 
Ackerman backed off, and Mr. Whitacre, then chief executive of SBC Communications Inc., bought AT&T, they 
added. That deal was only completed five months ago. 
It had been expected that Mr. Whitacre would retire close to November, when he turns 65. His associates said he 
wasn't ready to retire, and, last week AT&T's board extended his contract until spring 2008. Mr. Ackerman has 
said he would stay on at BellSouth to shepherd the acquisition, which is expected to take about a year to close. If 
asked to leave, Mr. Ackerman would collect $9 million as well as millions of dollars' worth of restricted stock and 
options, according to public filings.

What the AT&T Deal Means for Consumers --- Latest Telecom Merger Is Expected to Lower Price for Bundled Services; the $100 Target 
What the AT&T Deal Means for Consumers --- Latest Telecom Merger Is Expected to Lower Price for 
Bundled Services; the $100 Target

THE $67 BILLION merger that will make BellSouth Corp. part of AT&T Inc. is expected to accelerate the battle of 
the bundles. 
The cable industry and the phone companies are aggressively competing to attract new customers by offering 
attractively priced packages of home phone, Internet, cable and cellphone services. AT&T Chairman and Chief 
Executive Edward Whitacre has long identified $100 as a potential target price for a package of those four 
services. While that price hasn't been offered yet, the merger increases the pressure on the phone and cable 
rivals to deliver more competitive packages as a way to keep competing services from poaching customers. 
Prices are already in the $100 range for packages that don't include wireless -- and industry executives expect 
them to come down. A larger AT&T will be able to compete more aggressively with cable companies and, after 
cutting costs, will likely be able to reduce prices of service packages. 
Comcast Corp. is rolling out a $99 a month Internet, phone and cable bundle. The package -- currently available 
in parts of New England, the Philadelphia area and a few other markets -- represents about $30 off the price of 
purchasing each service individually. The package will soon be available elsewhere in the nation. 
The basic bundles from Time Warner Inc. include digital cable, high-speed Internet, and home phone service, and 
range from $99 to $129.95 depending on the city. Packages are available in all 27 of the states Time Warner 
serves and savings start at roughly $15 a month over a la carte rates. 
Bundles do benefit big spenders and those who prize convenience. But they aren't great deals for everyone. 
People who spend very little on wireless or long-distance might be better off cherry-picking from different 
companies. And consumer advocates caution that customers shouldn't add services they don't already use just 
because they are cheaper in a package. 
Another issue for consumers: Bundle prices often are introductory rates that will rise after a set amount of time. 
AT&T, for instance, increases its high-speed Internet price to $30 from $13 a month after the first year. The prices 
also don't include the taxes and fees that can add 20% or more to the total bill. 
Bundling is still something of a novelty for consumers, though it is slowly catching on. In 2004, only 8% of 
consumers surveyed by Forrester Research, a consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass., had a package of 
video, Internet and voice service from their phone or cable company, but by late last year 11% were buying 
packages. 
For the companies that sell bundles, the goal is a more loyal customer and a larger share of that customer's 
spending. Customers who take several products together are much less likely to defect just because a rival offers 
a slightly better price. A survey by Yankee Group, a Boston-based consulting firm, found that 84% of households 
that got a package of Internet and video services from their cable company were satisfied with their carrier, 
compared with 67% of households without the bundle. Still, the survey found that some customers become willing 
to switch for savings of $15 a month or more. 
Phone and cable companies have been locked in an intensifying battle as phone companies expand into video 
and cable companies start to offer phone service. The prize is the potential to provide all of a household's 
communications services. Bundle offers can be a way for service providers to cut off a competitor's link to the 
consumer's home altogether.

Cablevision Systems Corp. offers all its subscribers an introductory package of voice, cable and high-speed 
Internet for $89.85 a month. After a year, the price climbs to around $115. A la carte prices are $44.95 for 
Internet, $34.95 for voice and roughly $55 for digital cable. Verizon Communications Corp. offers packages that 
start at around $89.89 for home phone, high-speed Internet and satellite TV service. 
AT&T has a four-way deal that includes wireless for $121 a month. The merger could make it easier for AT&T to 
extend its bundled offers, says company spokesman Michael Coe. The merger will give AT&T full control of the 
Cingular Wireless venture that is now a joint venture between AT&T and BellSouth. 
Packages are convenient and can be good deals for consumers who already spend a lot on communications and 
entertainment. Bundles that now mostly appeal to consumers on the basis of price and convenience could 
develop into truly integrated services with features like cellphones that automatically become home-phone 
extensions when plugged into a base station at home, caller ID that is displayed on the TV screen, or video 
recorders that can be programmed with a cellphone. 
Not all consumers stand to benefit from service packages, however, and many consumer advocates fear that the 
phone and cable companies will eventually become so large that they essentially can dictate prices. Bill 
Hardekopf, chief executive of SaveOnPhone.com, a consumer Web site, believes that consumers who spend little 
on long distance or wireless won't benefit from packages. One of the only alternatives will be through 
Internet-based phone services. Vonage Holdings Corp. and the Skype Technologies unit of eBay Inc. offer 
cheaper prices for Internet-based home phone service than most phone or cable companies. Vonage offers 
unlimited local and long-distance service in the U.S. and Canada for $24.99 a month with minimal taxes and fees. 
Internet-based services often can't offer full-service 911 and won't work if the power or Internet connection fails. 
Customers must already have high-speed Internet service.

Over the years, AT&T Inc. chairman Edward Whitacre and BellSouth Corp. chief executive officer Duane 
Ackerman had talked many times about a deal before they finally agreed to the largest one in the history of the 
U.S. telecommunications industry. 
In two years, though, both will likely be retired. 
Before the deal Randall Stephenson, AT&T's chief operating officer, and Mark Feidler, who held the same title at 
BellSouth, were widely acknowledged to be the heirs apparent of their respective companies once their bosses 
retire. While it's likely they will play significant leadership roles in the combined company, analysts and investors 
believe that Mr. Stephenson has the inside track to be chief executive. 
Randall is clearly the anointed one within AT&T and Mark as the No. 2 in BellSouth needs to know that he'll 
have to be No. 2 or 3 in the new entity, says a consultant who has worked with both companies. 
Mr. Stephenson, who has spent his 24-year career with the company mainly overseeing telecom finances, and 
Mr. Feidler, a former corporate lawyer and banker, have both been supporters of an AT&T takeover of BellSouth, 
people familiar with the situation say. 
Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Feidler have a good working relationship and already have one deal in common. They 
both helped negotiate the Cingular Wireless acquisition of AT&T Wireless. BellSouth and AT&T own Cingular in 
a joint venture. After the deal was completed, one of the first things Mr. Stephenson did was make a 
congratulatory phone call to Mr. Feidler. 
Mr. Feidler, 49, a graduate of Vanderbilt Law School who joined BellSouth in 1991, is known for getting into the 
nitty-gritty of the business. Associates say he has an excellent, almost impish sense of humour. He's not a 
practical joker but rather is known for his wit, and he makes it clear he doesn't take himself or his situation too 
seriously. 
Mark is probably the smartest guy in whatever room he's in, says a former consultant who has also worked with 
both companies. Unfortunately, don't think he has a shot at the top job. 
What has endeared Mr. Stephenson, 45 years old, to Wall Street is a very blunt and charismatic style. He has 
been a patient and competent sideman to Mr. Whitacre and is known for his rapid recall of matters at hand. Like 
Mr. Whitacre, he's a very hands-on manager and focused on the minutiae of his business. He's charismatic, 
known as a gentleman and is adored by the management at AT&T. 
In an era of new regulations, many executives and companies have become tight-lipped and stick to scripts. But 
Mr. Stephenson, who holds a master's degree in accounting from the University of Oklahoma, always makes an 
effort to explain issues and to be as forthcoming as possible, analysts who have dealt with him say. 
A loyal lieutenant to Mr. Whitacre, Mr. Stephenson nevertheless pushed the company to change and was a 
proponent of the Cingular deal with BellSouth, the consultant said. He was also behind the decision of AT&T to

Page 37 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
have a presence in Hollywood near the content providers for its Internet television venture, Project Lightspeed, 
the consultant said. 
Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Feidler are energetic approaching the prime of their careers, but they must answer to 
and take direction from a chief executive who is for now firmly in charge. Their roots are starkly different from Mr. 
Whitacre, 64, and Mr. Ackerman, 63, both of whom started out working at the bottom of the phone business, 
before ascending through the executive ranks. 
Mr. Ackerman and Mr. Whitacre have a great deal of respect for one another and share a cultural affinity for one 
another's similar telecom backgrounds. After many attempts at a deal through the years Mr. Ackerman finally 
relented because he found his company in somewhat of a pickle. SBC Communications had acquired AT&T 
Corp. and all its enterprise assets to become AT&T Inc., and Verizon had taken over the business assets of MCI 
Inc. Suddenly, BellSouth had two major competitors who could sell a better package of services to companies in 
its own backyard. The two men met a handful of times to discuss terms of the deal, but there wasn't much 
wrangling. Their companies' stocks have been trading at roughly similar prices and because they'd contemplated 
a deal for so long there wasn't much to haggle over. 
Mr. Whitacre is known as an operator. He's a master of the deal and a broker who has honed his skills at timing 
with his many acquisitions through the years. 
His board members trust him implicitly and he can assemble them rapidly if he wants to move fast on a deal.

Even before SBC Communications completed its Dollars 16bn takeover of AT&T last year and took its name, 
Edward Whitacre instructed his investment bankers to step up their analysis of his next big deal: a takeover of 
BellSouth. 
Across the US telecoms industry and on Wall Street, the move was no secret. 
A combination with BellSouth was the next logical step for Mr Whitacre's AT&T, which had emerged as the 
largest operator in the sector. 
But few expected AT&T to move as quickly as it did. In January, Mr Whitacre went in for the kill. He dispatched 
Roger Altman, one of his most senior bankers, to meet Duane Ackerman, chief executive of BellSouth, and 
deliver AT&T's Dollars 67bn offer in person. 
The pitch by Mr Altman, head of boutique investment bank Evercore and a former Clinton administration official, 
centred on the benefits that BellSouth shareholders would gain in a takeover by AT&T, according to insiders. 
Until recently, BellSouth had enjoyed a privileged position in the US telecoms industry. 
With a protected market in the south-eastern region around its Atlanta headquarters, the company could generate 
higher margins than its competitors. But that advantage was waning because of the rise of new technologies and 
cable companies' provision of telephone services. 
Mr Altman said AT&T would make the much-needed investments to upgrade BellSouth's infrastructure, 
particularly in broadband. In addition, Mr Altman said there was a compelling case to consolidate Cingular 
Wireless - AT&T and BellSouth's mobile phone unit that was becoming harder to manage as a joint venture. 
The arguments struck a chord with Mr Ackerman. Soon after, he went on a hunting trip with Mr Whitacre. "Luckily 
they didn't take any lessons from Dick Cheney," jokes one adviser. 
Within weeks, more detailed discussions between the executives had taken place. 
By late February, Mr Ackerman and Mr Whitacre had agreed the price, leaving their advisers to hammer out 
details at the offices of law firms Sullivan &Cromwell and Fried Frank. 
In particular, it was the timing of AT&T's takeover of BellSouth that defied common wisdom. Most observers 
expected the deal to happen later this year, after the integration of AT&T's takeover of SBC had been fully 
implemented. 
But yesterday, the deal's insiders explained what had caused AT&T to move so soon. 
BellSouth was willing to sell - a window that would not necessarily be open forever, given Mr Ackerman's 
impending retirement. 
AT&T had recently raised its expectations on cost savings in the AT&T/SBC merger, giving it more confidence in 
its projections.

Page 39 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
AT&T had also just completed a rebranding exercise - including a high-profile and costly advertising campaign - 
that could help sell a takeover of BellSouth. To cap it all off, the regulatory environment was improving, as 
Washington recognised the need for telecoms group to be strong in the face of rising competition. 
Throughout his career, Mr Whitacre has garnered a reputation for being the first to react as consolidation 
pressures mount in a sector. 
Cingular's takeover of AT&T Wireless led Sprint to merge with Nextel, while SBC's takeover of AT&T caused 
Verizon to pursue MCI. 
As he integrates BellSouth, the tall Texan can sit back and watch his latest deal cause more ripples in the global 
telecoms industry.

AT&T ambitions stir net neutrality debate.

AT&T's plan to acquire BellSouth could have a significant impact on the debate over "net neutrality", a hot topic 
on Capitol Hill this year that means treating all internet content and traffic equally. 
Edward Whitacre, AT&T chief executive and architect of the deal, has been one of the most strident advocates 
of charging internet and media content companies additional fees for distributing their services over the telecoms 
industry's high-speed networks and the internet backbone that they control. 
"We have to figure out who pays for this bigger and bigger IP network," said Mr Whitacre in an interview with the 
FT at the end of January. "We have to show a return on our investments." 
Such comments have already made the AT&T chief unpopular with advocates of network neutrality, who were 
already arguing ahead of the AT&T/BellSouth announcement that consolidation in the US telecoms sector put 
too much power in a few hands and could threaten open internet access. 
Mr Whitacre even earned himself the nickname "my pipes" after he said last year: "Why should they be allowed to 
use my pipes? The internet can't be free in that sense, because we and the cable companies have made an 
investment, and for a Google or Yahoo or Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes (for) free is nuts." 
The opening shots in the net neutrality debate on Capitol Hill were fired last month when Vint Cerf, one of the 
early pioneers of internet technology and chief internet evangelist at Google, called on Congress to pass a law 
preventing telecoms companies from discriminating between the internet services carried over their networks. 
As Craig Moffett of Sanford Bernstein points out: "Watchdog groups and tech companies are likely to press for 
'net neutrality' as a condition of merger approval in Washington . . . such conditions could well stall the prospect of 
'multiple layers' for broadband for years to come and, ironically, result in a less hospitable climate for further 
network investments." 
Under a policy adopted by Michael Powell, former Federal Communications Commission chairman, US regulators 
have prevented telecoms groups from blocking specific internet services that pass over their networks. 
However, the regulations do not deal with special pricing for guaranteed levels of service. 
But Blair Levin, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, says that although AT&T's takeover creates an opportunity for the 
volume on the net neutrality debate to be raised, it is ultimately unlikely the FCC would impose tougher conditions 
on the deal in connection to the issue than was already imposed on SBC's takeover of AT&T last year. 
"Congress is now considering the network neutrality issue, and if it indicates it does not see a problem, it would 
be a bit unusual for the FCC to regulate on the issue more fully," Mr Levin said. 
A former FCC official was also doubtful that the deal would be derailed or hurt by the ongoing net neutrality 
debate: "They may have to add a more robust(condition) on net neutrality,but it would be a fig leaf more than 
anything. The pipes is where you need the investment, and no one is going to do much to put at risk more 
investment there."

IN THE MONEY: AT&T Deal A Boost To Ackerman's Retirement 
IN THE MONEY: AT&T Deal A Boost To Ackerman's Retirement

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 
This week's headline buyout among Southern phone companies will shower nearly $50 million in severance 
benefits on the chief executive of BellSouth Corp. (BLS). 
Duane Ackerman, chairman and chief executive of BellSouth, has agreed to stay on with the merged companies 
until his slated retirement in 2007. A clause in the "change of control" provisions of BellSouth's executive 
compensation plan will extend severance benefits to the retiring executive just as if he were jettisoned in the take 
over. 
Under a 1998 employment agreement, Ackerman had accrued more than $30 million in restricted stock, options, 
deferred compensation and supplemental retirement from the Atlanta-based phone company. In addition, the deal 
with AT&T Inc. (T) triggers change of control provisions that will pay the executive three times his annual salary 
and three times his annual bonus. 
All options, restricted stock and deferred compensation will also vest immediately and the company pledges to 
make "gross up" payments to cover taxes on the windfall which will total about $50 million. 
A BellSouth spokesman confirmed that the "change in control agreement will supersede," previous employment 
agreements for Ackerman and perhaps other BellSouth executives. 
Richard Anderson, vice-chairman of BellSouth, Mark Feidler, president, and Francis Dramis, chief information 
officer, also are covered by the change of control clause. 
But it would only apply to those executives "in the event of involuntary termination" in connection with the deal. 
"AT&T has agreed to offer employment to a number of our executive officers," said Joe Chandler, a BellSouth 
spokesman. 
So far, Feidler has been offered a position in the merged companies he said. 
But there is a chance any of the executives could continue working with the merged companies for up to two 
years and still collect severance benefits, according to details of the severance plan contained in security filings. 
BellSouth executives are entitled to the benefits up to 24 months after a change of control if their departure is 
involuntary. 
Chandler confirmed that is the case but wouldn't comment on what plans the company or the executives might 
have. The change of control provision could trigger payouts of between $3 million and $6 million for those 
executives. 
AT&T Chairman Edward Whitacre will serve as chairman and chief executive of the combined companies, which 
would do business as AT&T and be based in San Antonio. Whitacre has agreed to extend his contract beyond 
this year, when he turns 65. 
Ackerman will remain chairman of the BellSouth unit of the merged companies until his retirement planned for 
next year.

The pay out to Ackerman puts him in good company. 
James Kilts, former head of Gillette Co., recently received a severance package from Gillette valued at more than 
$150 million. In addition, filings show he received a pledge of stock and options from acquirer Procter & Gamble 
Co. (PG) valued at $23 million to stick around as vice chairman for a year. He also agreed to a non-compete deal 
through 2009. 
Michael Capellas received $39 million after selling MCI to Verizon Communications (VZ). A.D. "Pete" Correll, 
chief executive of Georgia Pacific Corp. is slated to receive more than $90 million for selling that company to 
privately held Koch Industries. John Eyler, chief executive of Toys 'R' Us Inc. (TOY), may receive about $60 
million for selling the struggling chain to private equity group Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts & Co. 
Executives earn their pay by creating shareholder value. Kilts made Gillette the dominant name in shaving. 
Correll transformed GP form a lumber company to a consumer products giant. Capellas led MCI out of 
bankruptcy reorganization. Eyler has tried to avoid similar reorganization. 
BellSouth offered an attractive dividend yield that hovered below 4%, but $100 invested in its shares in 2000 was 
worth only $78 at the end of 2005. 
Executives argue that a large share of severance benefits are contained in the rapid vesting of stock options and 
other benefits that the executive would have received anyway given the passage of time. But since time is money, 
rapid vesting puts future gains in an executive's hands immediately which makes the accrued benefit more 
valuable. 
Corporate boards also defend severance packages as reasonable incentives to make sure executives are 
negotiating with the best interest of shareholders in mind and not just to protect their paychecks or their turf in 
competitive industries. A pile of cash is reasonable comfort for a loser even in the hyper-competitive world of 
mergers and acquisitions. 
But that's what makes Ackerman's benefit at BellSouth all the more interesting. The merger may put his 
company and shareholders in a better position for the future and it sure puts Ackerman in a better position as 
well.

News in Depth: Pact represents gamble regulators will accept new telecom giant

Washington -- AT&T INC.'S PLAN to buy BellSouth Corp. represents a big bet that regulators will approve a 
once-unthinkable telecommunications deal both because of the Bush administration's pro-business stance and 
the increasing competition phone companies now face from cable-television and Internet services. 
The deal's timing, just five months after SBC Communications Inc. completed its acquisition of AT&T, whose 
name it then adopted, suggests that the management of AT&T sees a rare window of opportunity to pull off 
back-to-back transactions. Republicans control the White House and Congress. And the new chairman of the 
Federal Communications Commission has been an unexpectedly strong supporter of the old Bell phone 
companies. 
The Justice Department, meanwhile, has been receptive to megamergers in the phone industry. Last year, it 
approved a handful of blockbuster deals without any major concessions, including SBC's deal with AT&T and 
Verizon Communications Inc.'s acquisition of MCI Inc. That might leave it hard-pressed to block an 
AT&T-BellSouth transaction. 
If the FCC follows "the road map they wrote last year during the other two mergers, there aren't a lot of speed 
bumps on it for AT&T, and definitely not a brick wall," said Blair Levin, a former FCC official who is now a 
telecommunications analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. 
Others warn that the latest deal may represent a bridge too far for the industry, mobilizing a more diverse and 
vociferous coalition of opponents than past transactions. Last year's megamergers prompted complaints from 
some consumer groups, business customers and competitors. Now, those foes could join forces with technology 
companies who fear the Bells will use their market dominance and control over access to the Internet to extract 
new revenue for speedy delivery of Internet traffic to consumers. 
Already, some phone companies are considering ways of offering guaranteed delivery times for Internet traffic, 
much as FedEx Corp. guarantees package delivery. That is a departure from the egalitarian way the Internet has 
worked so far. As a result, technology companies are urging Congress to write into law the principle of "Internet 
neutrality," the idea that all Internet traffic, from simple email messages to lengthy videos, should be treated 
equally. 
On Sunday, even before the deal was officially announced, the Center for Digital Democracy, a Washington 
group that promotes "democratic" broadband access, proclaimed that the transaction would become a "poster 
child" in the "campaign to protect the Net." 
"AT&T wishes to be lord of the digital domain, able to impose a raft of tolls, fees and what they term 
`monetization' strategies for the Internet -- whether it comes to us via wires or wireless devices," said Jeff 
Chester, the group's executive director. 
Opposing interest groups are likely to make their displeasure known to Congress, whose members face elections 
in just eight months. While Republicans might ordinarily be inclined not to kick up much of a fuss, this year's 
election is expected to be bruising, and Republicans may be under pressure to be more populist in their rhetoric 
and possibly more willing to distance themselves from the Bush administration, given President George W. 
Bush's low approval ratings. 
Democrats are clearly itching to push the issue. In a statement, Massachusetts Rep. Edward J. Markey, the 
ranking Democrat on the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, called the deal "a 
mother and child reunion," and said it "unquestionably merits the utmost scrutiny by government antitrust

Page 48 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
officials." He added that "lawmakers should thoroughly review this merger proposal to fully assess its impact on 
consumers and competition." 
The merger partners' best argument may simply be the shifts in the telecommunications landscape since the 
court-ordered 1984 breakup of the old AT&T, once widely known as Ma Bell. In the past decade, long-distance 
phone rates have come down and consumers have many more options for their phone service. The landmark 
1996 Telecommunications Act initially presumed phone companies would start competing head-to-head for 
customers, but the more-enduring alternatives have come from elsewhere. 
Cable companies are increasingly offering phone service as part of their consumer packages. Service 
improvements and well-priced calling plans from wireless carriers have led some to give up their landlines 
entirely. And high-speed broadband connections have sparked a whole new industry that allows voice calls to 
travel over the Internet. 
"The intensity is incredible. These companies are taking tens of thousands of customers from us. We have the 
Vonages, the voice-over-IPs, the Googles, the Yahoos and other wireless carriers. It's very intense, and we 
continue to lose access lines," AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Edward Whitacre said in an interview. "We 
want a bigger footprint. The world is changing. There is more competition." 
In approving last year's sales of AT&T and MCI to the respective Bell giants SBC and Verizon, Justice 
Department and FCC officials cited the new forms of competition as the reason those combinations wouldn't hurt 
consumer and business customers. 
It is clear that AT&T will make the same argument in defending a BellSouth purchase, and it indicated as much 
in the headline of its news release announcing the deal. The combination, the company said, "will speed 
innovation, competition and convergence." 
"Technology changes and convergence are shaping a new competitive dynamic and creating tremendous 
opportunity, said Duane Ackerman, chairman and chief executive of BellSouth. "We're creating a company with 
much better capabilities to seize these opportunities." 
Company officials are expected to argue that the economies of scale the combination provides will enable them to 
increase high-speed Internet deployment, a key goal established by President Bush during his 2004 re-election 
campaign, and enable them to provide television signals over those lines, making them a direct competitor to 
cable companies and satellite-television operators. 
For consumer groups and others, the concern is that customers still could be left with just two choices for such 
services -- a cable behemoth versus a telecommunications one. "It demonstrates that more than ever the two 
dominant communications competitive spaces will be represented by cable and phone companies, and it 
increases the weightiness of policy issues, because fewer companies can have an exponentially more dramatic 
impact on the whole country," said Michael K. Powell, who stepped down as FCC chairman last year. 
In addition, the rationale for a BellSouth acquisition differs from SBC's earlier deal with AT&T and Verizon's deal 
with MCI. Those companies were seeing the rapid erosion of the long-distance phone market as they struggled to 
compete against bigger phone and cable rivals. BellSouth, while long considered a takeover target, isn't in 
financial distress. 
At the Justice Department, the review of the latest deal is expected to focus on high-volume data lines that serve 
business customers, especially office buildings and large corporate sites, where the combined companies face 
little competition and would be in a position to raise rates. In last year's AT&T and MCI deals, the department 
required the sale of just a handful of these lines, despite concerns by business users, competitors and consumer 
groups that the deals would lead to higher rates for phone and Internet service. A spokeswoman for the Justice 
Department declined to comment. 
AT&T is likely to count on the track record of Thomas Barnett, the Justice Department's new antitrust chief, who 
oversaw the approval of last year's telecommunications deals and hasn't challenged many mergers. Despite his 
approach, he has come under pressure from some Republican lawmakers and corporate lobbyists to ease 
antitrust enforcement further. 
The Bells also may have an ally in Kevin Martin, an FCC commissioner who took over as the agency's chairman 
last year. Bell executives were wary of him when he was a commissioner, but as chairman he pressed the FCC to 
move ahead promptly on the SBC and Verizon mergers last summer. Mr. Martin advocated approving the deals

without conditions, a goal he largely accomplished, though the FCC's two Democratic members extracted some 
conditions, including promises to honor Internet-neutrality principles. 
Mr. Martin also infuriated cable companies -- rivals to the Bells -- by launching a review of FCC rules to see if the 
agency could help the Bells' efforts to obtain video-franchising agreements faster, thereby helping them offer 
television service in markets previously served by cable and satellite providers. 
The deal will be reviewed by an FCC that includes two new Republicans, Deborah Taylor Tate and Robert 
McDowell, who is awaiting confirmation by the Senate. Both are likely to inject more skepticism into their review of 
the deal. Ms. Tate comes to the commission from Tennessee with a long background in working with state utility 
commissioners, which often did battle with the big local-phone giants over rates, customer service and other 
issues. Mr. McDowell, a veteran telecommunications attorney, currently serves as assistant general counsel at 
Comptel, an association that represents smaller telephone companies trying to compete with the Bells. Comptel 
was a vocal opponent of last year's deals. 
Some of the loudest protests may be about the control AT&T will have over high-speed Internet access and 
whether it plans to charge for faster delivery of content. In both the earlier AT&T and Verizon deals, the FCC 
extracted a promise that the companies would voluntarily comply to the agency's nonenforceable Net-neutrality 
principles for two years. That included the promise that consumers could use the Internet as they chose and 
attach whatever devices they liked to it. 
However, soon after the mergers closed, AT&T executives began publicly complaining about how Internet phone 
competitors like Vonage Holdings Corp. were using AT&T's network free of charge to compete for its customers. 
That has set off concerns in Washington about phone and cable companies using their role as gatekeepers to 
essentially declare the winners and losers of Internet services.

AT&T -BellSouth deal sets up new telecom race 
AT&T-BellSouth deal sets up new telecom race

A $67 billion deal to buy BellSouth Corp. puts AT&T Inc. back on top of the telephone industry -- but this time, it 
is just one of many rivals in a high-technology race to dominate telecommunications, television and the Internet. 
On Sunday, AT&T said it agreed to acquire BellSouth, aiming to create a supersize phone company that reunites 
four of the regional phone providers known as Baby Bells that were created in the historic 1984 breakup of Ma 
Bell. It will boast a market capitalization of as much as $170 billion, larger than any other telecommunications 
operator in the world. The deal's terms also require AT&T to assume $22 billion in debt. 
But AT&T's new marketplace would be unrecognizable to old Ma. The once-rigid boundaries between local 
service, long-distance, TV and online have been obliterated by technology. Phone companies are trying to offer 
TV services. Cable operators and upstart Internet companies are successfully selling phone services. Internet 
technology is even spreading to the wireless world, the main source of growth for most phone companies. 
With the communications industry a free-for-all, prices and profit margins are under massive pressure, and the 
race is on to snare as many customers as possible with packages offering phone, wireless, Internet and TV. 
AT&T wants to grab the 14 million consumers and six million business phone lines served by BellSouth, of 
Atlanta. The extra scale will be particularly helpful to AT&T as it pushes into the new terrain of TV and Internet 
phone service. At BellSouth, 85% of residential customers are capable of receiving high-speed Internet, over 
which AT&T will try selling TV and other services. 
"When you go back to the early 1980s, we were talking about a single product," said Duane Ackerman, 
BellSouth's chief executive, in an interview on Sunday. "Since then there has been a tremendous explosion of 
technology. It changed everything." 
The new AT&T will combine BellSouth's nine-state territory, which stretches from the Mississippi River to the 
Atlantic, with the old AT&T's customers on the West Coast, in the Southwest and Midwest, as well as businesses 
around the world. 
Consumer groups already have said they will oppose the deal, having long argued that consolidation in the phone 
industry reduces competition and raises prices. Still, some customers may benefit. AT&T's high-speed Internet 
service is significantly less expensive than that of BellSouth and AT&T has been more aggressive in rolling out 
television services. Consumers in BellSouth's region will likely see these new services sooner than if their 
provider remained the more cautious BellSouth. 
The recent history of AT&T in its many incarnations underscores an extraordinary transformation in 
telecommunications. Rarely has a single industry seen so many deals -- and more are now expected -- in 
response to competition and rapid technological change. 
The U.S. government broke up AT&T, then a monopoly, in order to create a more competitive industry. That 
yielded seven regional local phone companies and a long-distance company, which kept the original AT&T 
moniker. In the late 1990s, competition raged after long-distance and local companies started entering each 
other's territory. Telephone operators started merging, driven primarily by Edward Whitacre, the man who 
eventually became the architect of the new AT&T Inc. 
Mr. Whitacre started out in 1963 as a facility engineer with Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. in Lubbock, Texas. 
After climbing the corporate ladder, the Texan took his company from the smallest Bell to a leading regional 
player, acquiring Pacific Telesis, Ameritech and Southern New England Telecommunications.

Page 51 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
AT&T, meanwhile, had decided in the late 1990s that its future lay in cable. Under C. Michael Armstrong, it made 
a $100 billion bet on that technology just as the long-distance market collapsed amid competition from cheap 
upstarts, affordable wireless plans -- and fraudulent accounting by rival WorldCom. Without enough cash for debt 
and operations, Mr. Armstrong was forced to break the company into a wireless operation and a separate phone 
company, named AT&T Corp., and to sell the cable lines to Comcast Corp., Philadelphia. 
Two years ago, with the threat growing from Internet and cable companies, the industry's deal-making 
accelerated. The leading remaining Bells -- BellSouth, Mr. Whitacre's SBC Communications Inc. and Verizon 
Communications Inc., of New York -- began gobbling up assets. BellSouth talked to both AT&T and SBC but 
didn't reach an agreement with either. 
In 2004, SBC acquired AT&T Wireless, outmaneuvering the U.K.'s Vodafone Group PLC, which at the eleventh 
hour also made a bid. The deal instantly made Cingular, owned by SBC and BellSouth, the largest wireless 
operator in the country. Days after that deal was signed, Mr. Whitacre set out to acquire a long-distance 
company, first targeting MCI Inc. and then AT&T Corp. SBC succeeded in snaring AT&T and this year gave itself 
the storied name. 
Mr. Whitacre is nearing retirement, and the market had been anticipating one last hurrah. A BellSouth acquisition 
has long been the subject of speculation by analysts, investors and rivals. The deal came together in about five 
weeks, with the two sides holding the bulk of their negotiations at the offices of law firm Sullivan & Cromwell in 
midtown Manhattan. 
"We've talked about this on and off for years," Mr. Ackerman said. "Only in the last couple months did we get 
specific." 
The agreement's size is impressive: It is the fifth-largest U.S. deal ever, based on equity values, according to 
Dealogic, a markets data provider. Still, given telecommunications firms' poor track record of moving into new 
markets, there is no assurance the combined company will offer a better array of services than each side would 
have done alone. Nor is there any telling what new and unexpected competitors might be thrown up as 
communications technologies becomes less expensive and more widespread. 
Yesterday, Mr. Whitacre said the merger should speed the adoption of next-generation technology integrating 
wireless and wire-line networks. 
"Combined, we can do it faster than each company could alone," Mr. Whitacre said during a conference call to 
discuss the merger. 
Cable operators have taken a clear lead in the race to offer a bundle of TV, phone and Internet services. Cable 
operators have been aggressively launching phone service using Internet technology and added more than 
600,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter for a total of more than five million customers at the end of last year, 
according to Leichtman Research Group Inc., a technology research group in Durham, New Hampshire. More 
than 55 million homes can now get phone service from their cable company. 
By contrast, telephone companies offer TV to fewer than one million homes and have fewer than 10,000 
subscribers, not including their marketing arrangements with satellite operators, according to Leichtman. 
"With our aggressive rollout of digital phone service this year we expect to maintain and grow our competitive 
advantage over the Bells," said D'Arcy Rudnay, a spokeswoman for Comcast, the U.S.'s largest cable operator. 
The deal is sure to spark reactions from other telecommunications players. Verizon, previously the top company 
ranked by market capitalization, would be dwarfed by the new AT&T. It already has said it wants to buy the stake 
in Verizon Wireless held by Vodafone and will likely up the ante to get that done. The company also is interested 
in making an approach for Alltel Corp., a regional wireless company in Little Rock, Arkansas, say people familiar 
with the situation. 
Mr. Whitacre on Sunday tried fending off potential regulatory concerns. "There will be some who say we're putting 
the Bell system back together," he said in an interview. "But this is a different world." 
The combination of AT&T and BellSouth is designed to shore up both companies' defenses against cable 
operators and other competitors. Internet technology has allowed start-up companies such as Vonage Holdings 
Corp. and eBay Inc.'s Skype Technologies to offer phone service without owning their own networks, driving rates 
for calls to as low as zero. Vonage has signed up 1.5 million customers in the past two years, and Skype has

Page 52 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
more than 50 million users world-wide. Even Internet search companies such as Google Inc., Mountain View, 
California, and Yahoo Inc., Sunnyvale, California, have joined the fray with Internet-based chat services. 
The deal also will lead to significant cost savings, as the three networks belonging to AT&T, BellSouth and 
Cingular are merged into one, giving the combined entity more leverage over vendors such as equipment 
providers. 
AT&T says it expects to find about $2 billion a year in cost savings. Yesterday, AT&T's chief financial officer, Rick 
Lindner, said the company expects to cut some 10,000 jobs between 2007 and 2009, once the acquisition has 
closed. 
Acquiring BellSouth will give AT&T full control of Cingular Wireless, the U.S.'s largest wireless carrier. Not only is 
wireless the fastest growing part of the telecommunications industry, but it also is at the forefront of many new 
services, such as wireless broadband access for laptop computer users. 
Having one owner could help Cingular quickly roll out new services and to integrate the sales and marketing of 
the new company's regular and wireless offerings, which will likely be sold under the AT&T brand. Eventually, 
AT&T and Cingular could offer advanced options such as a single voice-mail service for both types of phones or 
the ability to transfer video content from TVs to cellphones, says Julie Ask, a research analyst at Jupiter 
Research. 
For years, BellSouth has operated as a kid brother to Mr. Whitacre's much larger, faster-moving company. At 
BellSouth, Mr. Ackerman, who is slated to retire next year, has focused on returning dividends to investors rather 
than spending money on innovations. 
As a result, BellSouth has lagged behind AT&T as it tries to find a home for itself in the future of 
telecommunications. BellSouth has been slow to pursue a television rollout, unsure about the potential payoff 
and the high investment, while AT&T and Verizon already have announced plans to include television as part of 
their package. BellSouth's only TV offer has been through a marketing alliance with the satellite-TV operator, 
DirecTV Group Inc., El Segundo, California. 
BellSouth also hasn't fully embraced a relationship it has with Yahoo. Meanwhile, AT&T has entered deals with 
the Internet company to create a mobile phone, among other services. BellSouth also has resisted deep price 
cuts in its high-speed Internet service. AT&T, by contrast, was the first major phone company to drop monthly 
fees to less than that of slower dial-up services. 
In the wake of the merger, AT&T will push its TV services into BellSouth's systems. AT&T has a venture with 
EchoStar Communications Corp., Englewood, Colorado, the other major satellite operator, dubbed HomeZone. 
HomeZone plans to introduce a new set-top box that will enable consumers to get both satellite-TV and movies, 
programs and other content via the Internet. AT&T invested $500 million in EchoStar in 2003 and some investors 
speculate EchoStar may be a future AT&T acquisition target. 
Longer term, AT&T plans to sell TV services on its own network using technology it claims will enable the 
company to offer features and content beyond the reach of cable operators. AT&T has begun a "controlled 
launch" of that service in San Antonio and plans to begin offering it more widely in the next six months or so. 
Under the terms of the proposed deal, news of which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal Online, 
shareholders of BellSouth will receive 1.325 shares of AT&T common stock for each BellSouth common share. 
Based on AT&T's closing stock price on March 3, that equals $37.09 a BellSouth common share, or nearly an 
18% premium over BellSouth's closing stock price. The total equity consideration is valued at about $67 billion. 
In New York Stock Exchange trading late yesterday morning, AT&T shares were off 40 cents each, or 1.4%, at 
$27.59, while BellSouth shares were up $3.56 each, or 11%, at $35.02 on the Big Board. Other telecom shares 
were higher as well. 
AT&T's Mr. Whitacre will serve as chairman and chief executive of the new company. His contract expires in 
November when he turns 65, but AT&T said the board asked him to stay on until March 2008 to shepherd the 
acquisition and he agreed to do so. 
Mr. Ackerman of BellSouth will be chairman and chief executive of his company's operations. Mr. Ackerman said 
he would stay on for a short time after the takeover until his retirement. Three members of the BellSouth board 
will join the AT&T board. The corporate headquarters will be in San Antonio, where AT&T is currently based.

AT&T's board also authorized a share-repurchase plan of 400 million shares through 2008. Under this plan, the 
company expects to buy back at least $10 billion of its common shares in the next 22 months. AT&T expects to 
repurchase $2 billion this year and $8 billion next year. 
AT&T was advised by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., New York, Evercore Partners, Rohatyn Associates and law 
firm Sullivan & Cromwell.BellSouth was advised by Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., New York, and

AT&T turns up pressure with $67bn BellSouth takeover

AT&T last night bolstered its position as America's biggest telecoms company with the $67 billion (Pounds 38 
billion) acquisition of BellSouth to create a $160 billion telecoms powerhouse. 
The deal, which was sealed last night after two months of talks, brings back under one roof four of America's 
seven Baby Bell phone companies that were created when AT&T was broken up in 1984. 
SBC, which bought AT&T last November for $16.5 billion and adopted the former national phone company's 
name, will complete its transformation from the smallest telecoms company in America to the biggest once the 
deal is complete. 
However, AT&T's move will also put the beleaguered Vodafone under fresh pressure as the deal consolidates the 
ownership of Cingular Wireless, the biggest mobile operator in the United States and the arch rival of Verizon 
Wireless, which is 45 per cent owned by Vodafone. 
Arun Sarin's position as chief executive of Vodafone has looked increasingly shaky after Friday's U-turn over the 
future of its Japanese business and rumours of a boardroom split. 
Verizon Wireless has been forced into second place in the US mobile market by Cingular Wireless and is 
expected to lose further ground as Cingular's integration is stepped up. 
Under the terms of the deal, Edward Whitacre, the AT&T chief executive, will become chairman and chief 
executive of the combined company, while Duane Ackerman, his BellSouth counterpart, will leave after a 
transitional period. 
BellSouth investors will receive 1.325 shares of AT&T for each share of BellSouth they own, valuing the deal at 
about $37 a share or some $67 billion -a 17.9 per cent premium over BellSouth's closing price last Friday. 
"This merger is a logical next step that creates substantial value for customers and stockholders of both AT&T 
and BellSouth," Mr Whitacre said. 
The extra cost savings of combining AT&T, BellSouth and Cingular Wireless under one roof are expected to 
reach $18 billion in total and shave $2 billion from annual overheads, the group said. 
The American telecoms market has been enmeshed in a complex series of demergers, joint ventures, mergers 
and acquisitions for the past 22 years. 
With this latest deal, the deconstruction of AT&T, previously known as Ma Bell, has almost come full circle. The 
deal also marks a further victory for Mr Whitacre, 64, who has completed $150 billion of acquisitions since taking 
the helm. 
AT&T said last night that it would expand its share buyback programme to $10 billion, with $2 billion to be bought 
back this year and $8 billion in 2007. It said that the merger would have no impact on 2006 profits and would be 
earnings neutral next year. The deal has yet to be approved by US competition authorities.

What does AT&T/BellSouth mean for consumers? The proposed merger of AT&T and BellSouth could 
accelerate innovation, but consumer groups worry it may stifle competition.

Only three months after it closed the merger of AT&T and SBC Communications, the new AT&T is opening its 
checkbook again to buy BellSouth for a whopping $67 billion. So what's this megamerger mean for consumers? 
Initially, consumers are not likely to even notice the merger, which is expected to close within the next year. For 
one, AT&T, which is still busy integrating business units and networks from its last merger, will also take time to 
make all the logistical changes associated with a merger of this size. 
Another reason consumers likely won't feel the impact right away is that the two companies don't directly compete 
with each other, except in some business accounts. AT&T provides local telephone service and broadband in 13 
states in the western and southwestern parts of the United States, whereas BellSouth provides those services in 
nine states in the Southeast. The two companies also jointly own Cingular Wireless, so other than a name 
change, the service isn't expected to be affected. 
But taking a longer-term view, consumers could see several changes. While the companies believe the merger 
will allow AT&T to roll out new services more quickly, consumer groups worry that a bigger AT&T will hurt 
competition by putting an even tighter squeeze on companies such as Vonage, which uses broadband networks 
to provide services like IP telephony to consumers. 
"Consumers won't actually begin to see any real change in services for at least two to three years," said Charles 
Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research. "Eventually, an integrated company could introduce new services 
more quickly. But there is a risk that a bigger AT&T could move slower." 
The wireless advantage 
The most immediate and obvious benefits of the merger will likely impact wireless customers. Wireless is one of 
the fastest-growing parts of AT&T, which owns 60 percent of Cingular Wireless. By taking full control of the 
company, executives at AT&T believe they will be able to use the revenue growth and the savings it will get by 
consolidating certain functions, such as marketing, to invest in new technologies and expand its business. 
"(This merger) will improve our growth profile with increased exposure to wireless," AT&T Chief Executive 
Edward Whitacre said during a conference call with analysts and investors on Monday. "And it will create a 
strong national and global competitor better positioned to innovate and deliver new services to both businesses 
and consumers." 
For example, AT&T could develop a new service that allows people talking on dual-mode wireless phones to use 
the cellular network when they are outside their home or office, but then switch over to a broadband IP network 
when they are making a call where they can receive a Wi-Fi signal. 
Not only does this give more options to customers, it allows AT&T to better manage usage on its network. Sprint 
Nextel touted this potential service when it announced a development relationship with four cable companies last 
year. 
Exploiting the alliance 
Other advanced communications services, such as a single voice mail service for wireless and landline phones, 
could be introduced. Video services could also be linked to cell phones.

Page 57 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
AT&#38T and BellSouth are also closely aligned when it comes to their wireline broadband strategies, which 
could mean speedier IPTV deployments for BellSouth customers. The main reason for this is that the companies 
have built their networks around a similar architecture. 
Unlike Verizon Communications, which is spending billions of dollars to extend fiber optics directly to consumers' 
homes, AT&T and BellSouth have extended their fiber networks only into neighborhoods. Then they use existing 
copper lines to offer broadband service using new ADSL technology, which allows them to increase download 
and upload speeds into the home. 
AT&T's project Light Speed, which provides TV service over broadband connections, is already being tested in 
San Antonio, Texas and is planned for wider deployment within the original AT&T footprint later this year. The 
similarities in the basic broadband architecture should make it easier for AT&T to extend its next-generation 
broadband services, such as Internet Protocol TV, into the BellSouth region. 
"BellSouth customers could eventually see IPTV much faster through AT&T than they ever would have with 
BellSouth," said Golvin. 
But a merged AT&T/BellSouth may also stifle competition and actually slow down innovation, according to 
consumer groups such as the Consumers Union and Consumer Federation of America. These groups said they 
would ask the Justice Department's antitrust division to reject the merger. Critics of the merger fear that a bigger 
and stronger AT&T would have too much influence in the overall market. 
For example, AT&T has already said that it would like to limit or tier services so that Internet companies such as 
Google or Vonage, which use broadband to deliver services to customers, would pay a fee for using the AT&T 
access network to reach customers. The topic has been hotly debated on Capital Hill and is likely to be a 
hot-button issue when and if Congress rewrites the Telecommunications Act. AT&T's CEO, Ed Whitacre, has said 
publicly that companies that use the AT&T broadband network should not be given a "free ride." 
"Merging with BellSouth would give AT&T that much greater market power and command over access 
networks," said Jay Pultz, a vice president at Gartner. "So I think it's a legitimate concern, considering that AT&T 
is already leaning toward premium pricing for companies that use their broadband networks to reach customers."

AT&T plans to acquire BellSouth for $67 billion 
AT&T plans to acquire BellSouth for $67 billion

AT&T Inc. confirmed that it is planning to acquire BellSouth Corp. for stock valued at about $67 billion, as intense 
competition between phone and cable companies reshapes the U.S. communications landscape. 
AT&T expects the deal to result in about $2 billion a year in cost savings. AT&T Chairman Edward Whitacre will 
serve as the new company's chairman, chief executive and a member of the board of the combined company. 
Under the terms of the deal, shareholders of BellSouth will receive 1.325 shares of AT&T common stock for each 
common share of BellSouth. Based on AT&T's closing stock price on Friday, the companies said this exchange 
ratio equals $37.09 a BellSouth common share, or a 18% premium over BellSouth's closing stock price. 
Three members of BellSouth's board will join the AT&T board. The corporate headquarters for the combined 
company will remain in San Antonio. The headquarters for Cingular Wireless, currently a joint venture of 
BellSouth and AT&T, will remain in Atlanta, as will the new combined company's Southeast regional telephone 
company headquarters. BellSouth's headquarters are currently in Atlanta. 
AT&T plans to phase out the Cingular wireless brand name and use the AT&T name. Cingular's main rival is 
Verizon Wireless, owned by Verizon Communications Inc. and London-based Vodafone Group PLC. 
An AT&T-BellSouth deal would effectively cleave the U.S.'s telecom services in two, each vertically integrated 
with a local phone operation, business services, and wireless unit. And it would effectively validate the vision of 
competition laid out by the U.S. government -- one in which traditional telecom firms compete directly against 
cable operators rather than against each other. 
A combination between AT&T and BellSouth could have a combined market capitalization of more than $150 
billion, making AT&T far larger than rival Verizon Communications. The deal would nonetheless set a showdown 
between AT&T and Verizon, as the two fight to control wireless, the growth portion of the telecom business. 
It was the steep growth of Cingular that helped push the two firms together, say telecom bankers familiar with the 
situation. As the importance of the wireless business grew, they said, it became inevitable that SBC (which 
adopted the AT&T name just months ago) would consolidate its position in the South. Put together, the AT&T 
territory would extend from California to Florida, north to Illinois and south to Texas. 
Mr. Whitacre has made a name for himself in the telecommunications industry as an acquirer. Mr. Whitacre is 
able to boast of a string of acquisitions, including Pacific Telesis Corp., Ameritech Corp. and Southern New 
England Telecommunications Corp. But as he nears retirement, the market had been anticipating one last hurrah 
from him; a BellSouth acquisition by AT&T has long been the subject of speculation from analysts, investors and 
the companies' rivals. 
Still the speedy move to acquire BellSouth came as a surprise so soon after Mr. Whitacre's takeover of AT&T 
Corp. last fall. His company is just starting to digest the $16 billion acquisition. The former SBC Communications 
Inc. took over AT&T Corp. and adopted the AT&T moniker. The new company dominates nearly every aspect of 
the industry, from high-speed Internet connections to long-distance phone service, as well as wireless. And Mr. 
Whitacre now has access to the old AT&T's enterprise business and world-wide network. 
Such a deal would likely prompt howls of protest in some quarters as it comes on the heels not only of the 
AT&T-SBC deal but also after Verizon Communications' acquisition of MCI. Those deals were approved with only 
a few minor conditions despite concerns they would lead to higher prices for business customers.

The wave of mergers has dramatically reshaped the U.S. telecom industry, and a purchase of BellSouth would 
further cement the recreation of the old Ma Bell, which the government pushed to break up in 1984. 
The management of AT&T, which apparently briefed key senior government officials late last week, appears to be 
betting that the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush and a Bell-friendly Federal Communications 
Commission won't raise too many obstacles for such a deal, arguing that the companies serve different 
geographic regions and don't currently compete with one another in a significant way. 
Although AT&T and Verizon's last mergers passed both FCC and Justice Department review with few major 
problems, the latest proposed merger may face more hurdles. AT&T and BellSouth executives recently have 
said they intend to explore new revenue streams from their high-speed Internet services by introducing two-tier or 
"premium" service for Internet content providers. Concerns about those plans and the concept of "net neutrality," 
or ensuring that consumers have open access to all Internet sites and services and businesses don't find their 
content slowed, have become major problems for the Bells in Washington. 
Meanwhile, the FCC that will be reviewing the AT&T/BellSouth deal will likely be a much different body soon with 
the addition of Robert McDowell, a veteran telecom lawyer who currently serves as assistant general counsel at 
Comptel, which represents smaller telephone companies and was a vocal opponent of the AT&T and Verizon 
mergers last year. 
Mr. McDowell is scheduled to appear before a Senate committee on Thursday for his confirmation and is likely to 
be asked about the merger. Although Mr. McDowell is a Republican, his nomination to the FCC was met with 
noticeable unease by the Bell companies, which have privately expressed some concern his experience working 
with smaller competitors may make him less than sympathetic to their concerns. 
A merger of AT&T and BellSouth would fuel even further the raging competition between cable operators and 
telephone companies, which are both racing to offer consumers the most attractive package of 
telecommunications services. Until now, AT&T and Verizon have announced plans to include television as part of 
their package, but BellSouth has been noncommittal about TV, saying it still hasn't decided whether the payoff 
was worth the additional investment. BellSouth's only TV offer has been through a marketing alliance with 
satellite-TV operator DirecTV Group Inc. 
If the merger is completed, AT&T would likely include BellSouth's systems in the two-tier TV strategy it has been 
pursuing. In the short term, AT&T is planning to add a broad range of services to its alliance with EchoStar 
Communications Corp., the other major satellite operator. The new venture, dubbed HomeZone, plans to 
introduce a new set-top box that will allow consumers to get both satellite TV and movies, programs and other 
content off the Internet. Indeed, EchoStar and AT&T have been working so closely that there has been increasing 
speculation that EchoStar may be a future AT&T acquisition target. (AT&T invested $500 million in EchoStar in 
2003.) 
Long term, AT&T plans to roll out television on its own network using Internet technology that it claims will enable 
the company to offer features and content beyond the reach of cable operators.

Merger Brings Cingular Under AT&T Umbrella

Is Ma Bell coming back into focus? AT&T, which recently was reborn out of a merger between SBC 
Communications and AT&T, announced a $67 billion stock deal to acquire BellSouth, combining Cingular 
Wireless' parents into one company. 
In November 2005, SBC closed its planned acquisition of AT&T Corp. and took on the AT&T name. At the time of 
the announcement, company chief executive Edward Whitacre announced plans to offer a wireless service 
under the AT&T brand. 
The deal to purchase BellSouth means Cingular Wireless, the No. 1 wireless carrier in the United States, will 
come under full control of AT&T and operate under the corporate moniker. 
"We think it is a smart move by our parent companies," Cingular Wireless spokesman Mark Siegel tells Wireless 
Week. "[The merger] will move us from a joint venture to sole ownership," he says, noting that it will streamline 
decision-making and create financial synergies. 
"The Cingular partnership and company itself are performing extremely well, particularly after the AT&T Wireless 
acquisition," Whitacre said in a prepared statement. "But no partnership between two independent companies, no 
matter how well run, can match the ...efficiency of a solely owned company." Cingular's ownership structure will 
be simplified by bringing it under a single AT&T brand, according to the company. 
Siegel points out, however, that the decision to bring Cingular under the AT&T brand will in no way change the 
carrier's current vision or strategies. The deal, he says, "will unlock our potential and brighten our prospects." 
After the deal closes, Whitacre will serve as chairman and CEO. Cingular's headquarters will remain in Atlanta. 
The agreement, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to close within the next 12 
months.

NEW YORK -- Ma Bell, welcome back. 
AT&T on Sunday announced plans to buy BellSouth for $67 billion in stock, about an 18% premium over 
BellSouth's current share price, and assume about $22 billion in debt. The result would be a telecommunications 
behemoth with about $120 billion in annual revenue. 
The Bell Telephone System was broken up by court decree in 1984. At the time, AT&T was carved out and set 
aside as an independent long-distance carrier. Seven regional Bells were also created and given control over the 
nation's local phone markets. With the BellSouth deal, four of the seven Bells -- plus AT&T -- would make up the 
company known as AT&T. Two more, plus GTE and MCI, belong to Verizon. 
Consumer advocates and others fret that this hyperconsolidation could lead to higher prices across the board -- 
for wireless, long- distance, Internet connections and more. 
"This is re-creating the Bell phone monopoly," says Berge Ayvazian, chief strategy director of Yankee Group. 
Gene Kimmelman, director of Consumers Union, agrees. "This demonstrates the enormous failure of antitrust 
oversight of the phone industry," he says. He says his group plans to ask the Department of Justice, from which 
the deal needs approval before it can close, to block it. 
The combined entity would be called AT&T. Telecom giant SBC late last year purchased what was left of AT&T 
and adopted the AT&T name. 
Edward Whitacre, AT&T's chairman and CEO, says people are getting unnecessarily worked up. 
Owing to its size, reach and resources, he says, the AT&T- BellSouth combination would be able to serve 
customers better. As for the concern that the telecom giant will raise prices, Whitacre says not to worry, it's not 
going to happen: "It's going to be very good for consumers. We'll have more products, better services and better 
prices." 
Whitacre allows that the merger also would make life easier for AT&T, especially on the wireless front. Cingular, 
the No.1 cellphone carrier, is jointly owned by AT&T and BellSouth. 
Shortly after the AT&T-SBC merger closed, AT&T announced plans to sell Cingular services under the AT&T 
name. That worried BellSouth, which, together with SBC, had spent billons promoting the Cingular name. 
With BellSouth out of the way, AT&T would be free to manage Cingular as it sees fit. One of its first actions 
would be to dump the Cingular name and replace it with the AT&T brand. 
Roger Entner, a wireless analyst at Ovum, says that would be a mistake. "AT&T in wireless is such a wounded 
name. It gives everybody the creeps who experienced the AT&T Wireless experience." 
AT&T Wireless, which was spun off from AT&T a few years ago, was beset by network problems. 
Whitacre says he isn't worried about that. "It won't have a black eye this time," he says flatly.

Just one Bell would be left standing with BellSouth out of the picture: Qwest. It's a combination of one of the 
original Bells -- US West -- and Qwest, a long-distance carrier. The company, which has a heavy debt load and 
an unattractive territory in the mountain West, has entertained purchase offers. It has been unable to strike a 
deal.

AT&T is about to become bigger. 
The telecommunications giant announced Sunday it has agreed to purchase Atlanta-based BellSouth in a stock 
deal valued at about $67 billion. 
The move would expand San Antonio-based AT&T into a new 13-state territory and give it complete control over 
Cingular Wireless, which is owned jointly by BellSouth and AT&T. 
AT&T, a New Jersey corporate icon for decades before being purchased by SBC Communications last year, is in 
a position to cement its status as the nation's largest telecommunications company. 
If approved by shareholders and regulators, a combined company would have a market capitalization of almost 
$160 billion with 70 million phone customers and nearly 10 million broadband Internet subscribers. 
Although the move isn't likely to have any immediate impact on New Jersey consumers, analysts say the sheer 
size of the new AT&T will allow it to more vigorously compete against cable companies that now offer phone as 
well as television service. 
AT&T, like Verizon Communications, is rolling out television services on a limited scale with plans to expand. 
"This deal accelerates the competitive threat" between phone companies and cable, said Jeff Kagan, an 
independent telecommunications analyst based in Atlanta. "AT&T is getting more territory and more customers 
and more revenues, and that means more of a threat to the cable industry." 
With complete control over Cingular Wireless, AT&T may have a better platform from which to take aim at 
Bedminster-based Verizon Wireless, a joint venture between Verizon and the British carrier Vodafone. 
AT&T's move comes just four months after SBC's purchase of Bedminster-based AT&T Corp. was finalized in 
November. The company changed its name to AT&T Inc. and continues to maintain significant operations in New 
Jersey including a network operations center and AT&T Labs. The company has said it plans to cut as many as 
13,000 jobs but won't say where the cuts will be made. 
This latest corporate combination could lead to more cuts as the company looks for savings. AT&T won't disclose 
how many New Jersey employees it has, but scores of managers have left over the past year, taking advantage 
of an early retirement offering. 
A marriage between AT&T and BellSouth is no surprise in the telecom industry as BellSouth has been the 
subject of merger speculation for years. 
The shift in the U.S. telecom landscape moving from four to three regional Bell operators is sure to garner close 
review from Washington. 
"Twenty years after the government broke up Ma Bell, this deal represents a mother and child reunion," said Rep. 
Ed Markey, the ranking Democrat on the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet. 
"Our nation's telecommunications markets must be vigorously competitive and open to innovation in order to 
promote job creation and economic growth," Markey said. "This merger proposal is one that unquestionably 
merits the utmost scrutiny by government antitrust officials."

AT&T CEO Edward Whitacre, the former SBC chief, has been on an acquisition tear, gobbling up AT&T Corp. 
for $16 billion last year and now BellSouth. 
One possible outcome for consumers might be simply a name change. 
AT&T said Sunday it plans to operate under one brand, making it likely that Cingular would change its name to 
AT&T Wireless. In an industry where a flowchart comes in handy to track all the mergers and takeovers, 
consumers may recall that AT&T Wireless was spun off by the old AT&T in 2001 and then purchased by Cingular 
in 2004. 
* * 
Growing force 
WHAT'S HAPPENING: AT&T Inc. says it will acquire rival BellSouth Corp., expanding the country's largest 
telecommunications company by the number of customers served. 
WORKERS AND CUSTOMERS: The merged company would employ more than 316,000 people to serve 70 
million local-line phone customers, 54 million cellphone users and 10 million broadband subscribers. 
WHAT'S NEXT: More competition with cable companies that now offer phone and television service. With 
complete control over Cingular Wireless, AT&T could pose a more serious challenge to Verizon Wireless.

Back to the future: AT&T to purchase BellSouth for $67 billion

AT&T said Sunday that it would acquire BellSouth for stock it valued at $67 billion, a merger that would create a 
U.S. telecommunications behemoth serving nearly 70 million local phone customers and controlling all of Cingular 
Wireless. 
AT&T is the largest U.S. phone company, while BellSouth, which operates in a nine-state region in the 
Southeast, is third, behind Verizon Communications. A combined AT&T-BellSouth would have $130 billion in 
sales and serve residential customers in 22 states. 
While consumer groups and AT&T's main rivals are likely to argue that the deal would concentrate too much 
power in AT&T's hands, U.S. antitrust regulators have not blocked large deals in recent years. The companies do 
not compete in the local phone and Internet businesses, and they already jointly own Cingular, the biggest U.S. 
cellphone company. 
As a result, consumers already buying services from AT&T, BellSouth and Cingular are unlikely to be affected 
directly. But the purchase would give AT&T more firepower to fight Comcast and other cable television companies 
that are quickly moving into the phone business. A union between AT&T and BellSouth had long been a subject 
of speculation because of their mutual stake in the fast-growing wireless industry. AT&T's chairman and chief 
executive, Edward Whitacre Jr., said that the deal was "a next logical step" and asserted that the merger "will 
strengthen Cingular through unified ownership and a single brand." 
"No partnership between two independent companies, no matter how well run," he added, "can match the speed, 
effectiveness, responsiveness and efficiency of a solely owned company." 
Under the deal, shareholders of BellSouth would receive 1.325 shares of AT&T common stock for each 
BellSouth common share. Based on AT&T's closing stock price on Friday, this would value the deal at $37.09 for 
each BellSouth common share. That represents a 17.9 percent premium over BellSouth's closing stock price on 
Friday. 
Whitacre has not been shy about paying top dollar for rivals to create a giant company that plays a major role in 
nearly every corner of the telecommunications industry. As chief executive of SBC Communication, he oversaw 
its $16 billion acquisition of AT&T last year and took over its name. 
Jeffrey Halpern, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said: "The empire-building continues. He has a track record of 
gobbling competitors at premium prices." 
In the past decade, SBC under Whitacre bought three other local phone companies, Pacific Telesis Group, 
Southern New England Telecommunications and Ameritech. Cingular bought AT&T Wireless in 2004. 
AT&T would keep its name once the deal for BellSouth is completed, and Whitacre would remain chairman and 
chief executive. 
The combined company would dwarf its nearest competitor, Verizon, which is bound to face more pressure to 
bulk up, too.

After SBC made its bid for AT&T last year, Verizon rushed to buy the long-distance carrier MCI. Verizon's next 
move is likely to be to try to dissolve its relationship with Vodafone, which owns 45 percent of Verizon Wireless, 
industry analysts said. Verizon has expressed interest in buying Vodafone's share, but the price tag is likely to be 
steep because Verizon Wireless is extremely profitable.

The US telecoms industry is poised for major upheaval after AT&Tannounced on Sunday it would acquire 
BellSouth for about $67bn. 
The long-expected move will see AT&T consolidate its position as the largest US carrier and take full control of 
Cingular, the two companies' fast-growing wireless joint venture. 
The acquisition marks the latest chapter in the reshaping of the US telecoms industry, where large mergers have 
been the answer to rapid changes in technology and the threat of competition from cable groups. 
Verizon - which will be only half of AT&T's size in terms of market capitalisation after the transaction - is likely to 
come under pressure to react with its own big deal. 
This could entail Verizon pursuing a takeover of rival Qwest or entering swift discussions with the UK's Vodafone 
to take full control of Verizon Wireless, their mobile phone joint venture, observers said. Since last year, Verizon 
has been busy integrating its acquisition of MCI for nearly $10bn, which gave it access to a vast network of 
long-distance and business customers. 
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.Edward Whitacre, chief executive of AT&T, has been the industry's most aggressive player, buying 
AT&T Wireless in 2004 for $41bn and AT&T itself last year, in a $16bn deal that allowed his company SBC 
Communications to take the AT&T name. 
AT&T is expected to pay $37.09 per share in stock for BellSouth, or an 17.9 per cent premium over the 
company's share price of $31.46 on Friday night. AT&T will also agree to take on about $17bn of BellSouth debt. 
Although an AT&T takeover of BellSouth has long been expected, many telecoms industry watchers on Sunday 
expressed surprise that an announcement had come so soon after the combination of SBC and AT&T. News of 
the discussions also immediately triggered speculation that the deal could spark a round of consolidation among 
the largest telecoms equipment makers, such as Lucent and Nortel. 
By combining overhead and marketing costs, as well as AT&T and BellSouth's local phone networks, which 
together stretch from California to Florida, the companies are expecting to generate at least $10bn in savings, 
said a person close to the talks. 
The combined company would have about 315,000 employees, though executives said up to 10,000 jobs would 
be eliminated after the merger. 
A key motivation behind the merger appears to be the fast growth experienced by Cingular Wireless, their 50-50 
mobile phone joint venture, which will be rebranded to take the AT&T name when the deal closes. 
AT&T will move to gain regulatory approval for the transaction, which reverses the break-up of "Ma Bell" sought 
by the US government in the 1980s. In recent years, the Federal Communications Commission has encouraged 
telecoms mergers, recognising that the competitive landscape has changed. 
Based in Georgia and run by Duane Ackerman, BellSouth had been absent from the last round of telecoms 
consolidation. Last year, it generated $3.3bn in net income from $20.5bn in revenue. 
AT&T and BellSouth declined to comment.

US-based telecoms operator AT&T is set to acquire BellSouth in a US$67bn deal. The merger will create the US' 
largest telecoms company, with coast-to-coat operations, offering fixed line, video and internet access as well as 
mobile phone services, through the joint venture Cingular Wireless it shares with BellSouth. This latest 
acquisition marks the ongoing reshaping and consolidation of the US telecoms market. Indeed, in 2005, AT&T 
underwent its own merger when it was acquired by SBC Communications, adopting the AT&T logo, while Verizon 
Communications purchased MCI Communications. 
A key decision behind AT&T's approach stems from the threat of greater competition it faces from cable 
companies and the need to provide the latest innovative technologies. Cable operators have taken a clear lead in 
the race to offer a bundle of TV, phone and internet services. In Q4 2005, cable companies recorded 600,000 net 
additions bringing its total to 5mn users at end 2005, while over 55mn homes had access to a phone service 
through their cable operator. In comparison, fixed line operators offer TV services to fewer than 1mn homes. 
Moreover, AT&T's move is also partly based on the rapid growth experienced by Cingular Wireless, which is the 
country's leading mobile operator, with a 26% share of the mark and provider of some of the market's latest 
services such as wireless broadband access for laptop users. Moreover, the merger will also help combine 
overhead and marketing costs, in addition to both AT&T and BellSouth's local phone networks, generating 
US$10bn in cost savings. 
However, the move has been criticised by some industry insiders for reducing competition and raising prices for 
businesses, with AT&T attaining a market value of US$150bn, over 50% that of Verizon. Meanwhile, the 
acquisition of BellSouth could be viewed as a step back in terms of re-creating Ma Bell, BellSouth's parent 
company, which was broken up by the US government in the 1980s in order to create a more competitive 
industry. Having said that, it will be a welcome development for customers falling under the BellSouth network 
umbrella, as the operators' high-speed internet services tend to be more expensive than AT&T. 
Meanwhile, under the terms of the proposed deal, shareholders of BellSouth will receive 1.325 shares of AT&T 
common stock for each BellSouth common share, which based on AT&T's closing share price, equals US$37.09 
per BellSouth common share, nearly an 18% premium over BellSouth's closing stock price. The newly formed 
operator will be headed by current AT&T fhairman and CEO Edward Whitacre, who has agreed to have his 
contract extended to 2008, in order to oversee the acquisition process. BellSouth fhairman and CEO Duane 
Ackerman will stay on for a short time after the takeover until his retirement, while three members of the board will 
join the AT&T board. The corporate headquarters will be in San Antonio, where AT&T is presently based.

(Adds comments in the third and 13th paragraphs.) By Roger Cheng Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--AT&T Inc. (T) plans to cut an additional 10,000 jobs as a result of its merger with 
BellSouth Corp. (BLS), according to Chief Financial Officer Rick Lindner. 
The cuts, which make up half of the expected operational expense reduction from the merger, will occur in 2007 
through 2009, Lindner said during a conference call Monday to discuss the merger. 
The cut comes on top of AT&T's estimate of 13,000 job cuts from its merger of AT&T and SBC Communications 
Inc.'s operations and another 13,000 jobs from operational initiatives. The combined company would have a total 
work force of 317,000, and a majority of the cuts will come through attrition. 
AT&T also sped up its expectations for total revenue growth. Lindner said revenue including Cingular should grow 
in 2007, a year earlier than previously projected. 
The deal should speed the adoption of next-generation technology integrating wireless and wireline networks, 
said AT&T Chief Executive Edward Whitacre. 
'Combined, we can do it faster than each company could alone,' Whitacre said. 
On Sunday, AT&T agreed to acquire BellSouth in an all-stock deal worth $67 billion. The deal further 
consolidates the telecommunication industry, and creates the largest phone company since the days prior to the 
breakup of the original Ma Bell in 1984. 
AT&T's 'solid history of working together' with BellSouth in building the Cingular Wireless business and 
Yellowpages.com directory business is the reason why Whitacre is confident that the integration will go smoothly, 
he said. 
'The strategic foundation for this merger is very sound,' he said. 
AT&T said it would keep the Atlanta facilities that currently serve as the headquarters for Cingular and BellSouth. 
Lindner sees an accounting impact of $3.9 billion to $4.2 billion in 2007, $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion in 2008, and 
$2.4 billion to $2.7 billion in 2009. Revenue synergies, meanwhile, will contribute to as much as $100 million in 
2008 and $100 million to $200 million in 2009. 
The merger would also weigh on earnings by 58 cents to 62 cents a share in 2007, 29 cents to 33 cents a share 
in 2008, and 15 cents to 19 cents in 2009. 
AT&T plans to eventually bring its Project Lightspeed high-speed network to the BellSouth territory, but Chief 
Operating Officer Randall Stephenson said the projected capital expenditures doesn't factor in the build-out. He

AT&T 's Whitacre Solidifies Legacy As Telecom Deal-Maker 
AT&T's Whitacre Solidifies Legacy As Telecom Deal-Maker

AUSTIN, Texas (Dow Jones)--Edward Whitacre, already known as a corporate wheeler and dealer, appears 
likely to solidify a position as an American business icon if his latest - and possibly last - big deal goes through. 
"He's going to be seen, rightly or wrongly, as the man who put Ma Bell back together again," Stifel Nicolaus & Co. 
analyst Christopher King said Monday. 
Whitacre, the 64-year-old chairman and chief executive of AT&T Inc. (T), is leading his company's planned $67 
billion purchase of BellSouth Corp. (BLS), which was announced over the weekend. 
The buyout would be the fifth-largest U.S. deal ever, according to The Wall Street Journal. It also would reunite 
with their parent four of the original seven so-called "Baby Bell" regional telephone companies created from the 
1984 breakup of the old AT&T, known as "Ma Bell." 
The deal will bring Cingular Wireless, a joint venture between AT&T and BellSouth, under single ownership as 
well. 
Whitacre became chief executive of the former Southwestern Bell, which once was the smallest of the Baby Bells, 
in 1990 and has been a driving force behind a wave of consolidation in the telecom sector. 
In the late 1990s, Whitacre spearheaded the purchase of Ameritech, Pacific Telesis and Southern New England 
Telecommunications in deals valued at $61 billion, $16.7 billion and $5 billion, respectively. 
Last year, Whitacre's renamed SBC Communications Inc. bought AT&T - its former parent under the old Ma Bell 
monopoly - in a $16 billion deal and took on its corporate moniker. 
"He is well thought of" on Wall Street, Stifel Nicolaus' King said. And "he certainly hasn't sat still." 
For a corporate deal-maker, however, Whitacre has something of an unlikely background. 
He has spent the bulk of his career with a single company, joining the former Southwestern Bell shortly after 
graduating from Texas Tech University in Lubbock in 1964. He methodically worked his way into the corporate 
suite after starting as a facility engineer. 
Those who know him in San Antonio, where his company is based, say he has a self-effacing style that 
complements his shrewd business acumen. Whitacre is a native of Ennis, a small community south of Dallas. 
"He is quiet and low-key, and I suspect that serves him very well," said Joseph Krier, president of the Greater San 
Antonio Chamber of Commerce. 
Krier called Whitacre something of a "regular guy" personally who is nonetheless extremely well-respected in 
local business circles. 
"He's the kind of guy that, when he walks into the room, people turn around and know he's there," Krier said. 
Whitacre's contract with AT&T was set to expire in November - when he turns 65 - although he now has agreed to 
stay on until March 2008 to steer the BellSouth acquisition.

Whether or not the deal turns out to be his swan song, Whitacre has cemented his reputation as an aggressive 
corporate risk-taker and telecom survivor. 
Still, some say his legacy is likely to take some time to assess because it will be tied to the fate of the telecom 
behemoth he has built. 
"The success of this deal (and AT&T long-term) is going to be largely determinant of his ultimate legacy," King 
said. "A lot of his legacy is going to be determined by what happens in the future."

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--AT&T Inc. (T) plans to cut an additional 10,000 jobs as a result of its merger with 
BellSouth Corp. (BLS), according to Chief Financial Officer Rick Lindner. 
The cuts, which make up half of the expected operational expense reduction from the merger, will occur in 2007 
through 2009, Lindner said during a conference call Monday to discuss the merger. 
The cut comes on top of AT&T's estimate of 13,000 job cuts from its merger of AT&T and SBC Communications 
Inc.'s operations and another 13,000 jobs from operational initiatives. The combined company would have a total 
work force of 317,000, and a majority of the cuts will come through attrition. 
AT&T also sped up its expectations for total revenue growth. Lindner said revenue including Cingular should grow 
in 2007, a year earlier than previously projected. 
The deal should speed the adoption of next-generation technology integrating wireless and wireline networks, 
said AT&T Chief Executive Edward Whitacre. 
"Combined, we can do it faster than each company could alone," Whitacre said. 
On Sunday, AT&T agreed to acquire BellSouth in an all-stock deal worth $67 billion. The deal further 
consolidates the telecommunication industry, and creates the largest phone company since the days prior to the 
breakup of the original Ma Bell in 1984. 
AT&T's "solid history of working together" with BellSouth in building the Cingular Wireless business and 
Yellowpages.com directory business is the reason why Whitacre is confident that the integration will go smoothly, 
he said. 
"The strategic foundation for this merger is very sound," he said. 
AT&T said it would keep the Atlanta facilities that currently serve as the headquarters for Cingular and BellSouth. 
Lindner sees an accounting impact of $3.9 billion to $4.2 billion in 2007, $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion in 2008, and 
$2.4 billion to $2.7 billion in 2009. Revenue synergies, meanwhile, will contribute to as much as $100 million in 
2008 and $100 million to $200 million in 2009. 
The merger would also weigh on earnings by 58 cents to 62 cents a share in 2007, 29 cents to 33 cents a share 
in 2008, and 15 cents to 19 cents in 2009. 
AT&T plans to eventually bring its Project Lightspeed high-speed network to the BellSouth territory, but Chief 
Operating Officer Randall Stephenson said the projected capital expenditures doesn't factor in the build-out. He 
added, however, that BellSouth's current plans to lay out fiber is consistent with AT&T's plans to increase the 
capacity and speed of its own network.

Wedding Bells: A Reborn AT&T to Buy BellSouth --- $67 Billion Deal Sets Field For a Race With Cable

(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
A $67 billion deal to buy BellSouth Corp. puts AT&T back on top of the telephone industry -- but this time, it is 
just one of many rivals in a high-technology race to dominate telecommunications, television and the Internet. 
Yesterday, AT&T Inc. said it has agreed to acquire BellSouth, aiming to create a super-size phone company that 
reunites four of the Baby Bells created in the historic 1984 breakup of Ma Bell. It will boast a market capitalization 
of as much as $170 billion, larger than any other telecommunications operator in the world. The deal's terms also 
require AT&T to assume $22 billion in debt. 
But AT&T's new marketplace would be unrecognizable to old Ma. The once-rigid boundaries between local 
service, long-distance, TV and online have been obliterated by technology. Phone companies are trying to offer 
TV services. Cable operators and upstart Internet companies are successfully selling phone services. Internet 
technology is even spreading to the wireless world, the main source of growth for most phone companies. 
With the communications industry a free-for-all, prices and profit margins are under massive pressure, and the 
race is on to snare as many customers as possible with packages offering phone, wireless, Internet and TV. 
AT&T wants to grab the 14 million consumers and six million business phone lines served by BellSouth, of 
Atlanta. The extra scale will be particularly helpful to AT&T as it pushes into the new terrain of TV and Internet 
phone service. At BellSouth, 85% of residential customers are capable of receiving high-speed Internet, over 
which AT&T will try selling TV and other services. 
"When you go back to the early 1980s, we were talking about a single product," said Duane Ackerman, 
BellSouth's chief executive, in an interview yesterday. "Since then there has been a tremendous explosion of 
technology. It changed everything." 
The new AT&T will combine BellSouth's nine-state territory, which stretches from the Mississippi River to the 
Atlantic, with the old AT&T's customers on the West Coast, in the Southwest and Midwest, as well as businesses 
around the world. 
Consumer groups already have said they will oppose the deal, having long argued that consolidation in the phone 
industry reduces competition and raises prices. Still, some customers may benefit. AT&T's high-speed Internet 
service is significantly less expensive than that of BellSouth and AT&T has been more aggressive in rolling out 
television services. Consumers in BellSouth's region will likely see these new services sooner than if their 
provider remained the more cautious BellSouth. 
The recent history of AT&T in its many incarnations underscores an extraordinary transformation in 
telecommunications. Rarely has a single industry seen so many deals -- and more are now expected -- in 
response to competition and rapid technological change. 
The U.S. government broke up AT&T, then a monopoly, in order to create a more competitive industry. That 
yielded seven regional local phone companies and a long-distance company, which kept the original AT&T 
moniker. In the late 1990s, competition raged after long-distance and local companies started entering each 
other's territory. Telephone operators started merging, driven primarily by Edward Whitacre, the man who 
eventually became the architect of the new AT&T Inc. 
Mr. Whitacre started out in 1963 as a facility engineer with Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. in Lubbock, Texas. 
After climbing the corporate ladder, the Texan took his company from the smallest Bell to a leading regional 
player, acquiring Pacific Telesis, Ameritech and Southern New England Telecommunications.

Page 79 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
AT&T, meanwhile, had decided in the late 1990s that its future lay in cable. Under C. Michael Armstrong, it made 
a $100 billion bet on that technology just as the long-distance market collapsed amid competition from cheap 
upstarts, affordable wireless plans -- and fraudulent accounting by rival WorldCom. Without enough cash for debt 
and operations, Mr. Armstrong was forced to break the company into a wireless operation and a separate phone 
company, named AT&T Corp., and to sell the cable lines to Comcast Corp., Philadelphia. 
Two years ago, with the threat growing from Internet and cable companies, the industry's deal-making 
accelerated. The leading remaining Bells -- BellSouth, Mr. Whitacre's SBC Communications Inc. and Verizon 
Communications Inc., of New York -- began gobbling up assets. BellSouth talked to both AT&T and SBC but 
didn't reach an agreement with either. 
In 2004, SBC acquired AT&T Wireless, outmaneuvering the United Kingdom's Vodafone Group PLC, which at the 
eleventh hour also made a bid. The deal instantly made Cingular, owned by SBC and BellSouth, the largest 
wireless operator in the country. Days after that deal was signed, Mr. Whitacre set out to acquire a long-distance 
company, first targeting MCI Inc. and then AT&T Corp. SBC succeeded in snaring AT&T and this year gave itself 
the storied name. 
Mr. Whitacre is nearing retirement, and the market had been anticipating one last hurrah. A BellSouth acquisition 
has long been the subject of speculation by analysts, investors and rivals. The deal came together in about five 
weeks, with the two sides holding the bulk of their negotiations at the offices of law firm Sullivan &Cromwell in 
midtown Manhattan. 
"We've talked about this on and off for years," Mr. Ackerman said. "Only in the last couple months did we get 
specific." 
The agreement's size is impressive: It is the fifth-largest U.S. deal ever, based on equity values, according to 
Dealogic, a markets data provider. Still, given telecommunications firms' poor track record of moving into new 
markets, there is no assurance the combined company will offer a better array of services than each side would 
have done alone. Nor is there any telling what new and unexpected competitors might be thrown up as 
communications technologies becomes cheaper and more widespread. 
Cable operators have taken a clear lead in the race to offer a bundle of TV, phone and Internet services. Cable 
operators have been aggressively launching phone service using Internet technology and added more than 
600,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter for a total of more than five million customers at the end of last year, 
according to Leichtman Research Group Inc., a technology research group in Durham, N.H. More than 55 million 
homes can now get phone service from their cable company. 
By contrast, telephone companies offer TV to fewer than one million homes and have fewer than 10,000 
subscribers, not including their marketing arrangements with satellite operators, according to Leichtman. 
"With our aggressive rollout of digital phone service this year we expect to maintain and grow our competitive 
advantage over the bells," said D'Arcy Rudnay, a spokeswoman for Comcast, the nation's largest cable operator. 
The deal is sure to spark reactions from other telecommunications players. Verizon, previously the top company 
ranked by market capitalization, would be dwarfed by the new AT&T. It already has said it wants to buy the stake 
in Verizon Wireless held by Vodafone and will likely up the ante to get that done. The company also is interested 
in making an approach for Alltel Corp., a regional wireless company in Little Rock, Ark., say people familiar with 
the situation. 
Mr. Whitacre yesterday tried fending off potential regulatory concerns. "There will be some who say we're putting 
the Bell system back together," he said in an interview. "But this is a different world." The AT&T-BellSouth deal 
and Verizon's acquisition of MCI were approved with a few minor conditions attached, despite concerns they 
would lead to higher prices for business customers. 
The combination of AT&T and BellSouth is designed to shore up both companies' defenses against cable 
operators and other competitors. Internet technology has allowed start-up companies such as Vonage Holdings 
Corp. and eBay Inc.'s Skype Technologies to offer phone service without owning their own networks, driving rates 
for calls to as low as zero. Vonage has signed up 1.5 million customers in the past two years, and Skype has 
more than 50 million users world-wide. Even Internet search companies such as Google Inc., Mountain View, 
Calif., and Yahoo Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif., have joined the fray with Internet-based chat services.

Page 80 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The deal also will lead to significant cost savings, as the three networks belonging to AT&T, BellSouth and 
Cingular are merged into one, giving the combined entity more leverage over vendors such as equipment 
providers. 
AT&T says it expects to find about $2 billion a year in cost savings. People familiar with the situation said AT&T is 
considering shedding about 8,000 jobs. 
Acquiring BellSouth will give AT&T full control of Cingular Wireless, the nation's largest wireless carrier. Not only 
is wireless the fastest growing part of the telecommunications industry, but it also is at the forefront of many new 
services, such as wireless broadband access for laptop computer users. 
Having one owner could help Cingular quickly roll out new services and to integrate the sales and marketing of 
the new company's regular and wireless offerings, which will likely be sold under the AT&T brand. Eventually, 
AT&T and Cingular could offer advanced options such as a single voice-mail service for both types of phones or 
the ability to transfer video content from TVs to cellphones, says Julie Ask a research analyst at Jupiter Research. 
For years, BellSouth has operated as a kid brother to Mr. Whitacre's much larger, faster-moving company. At 
BellSouth, Mr. Ackerman, who is slated to retire next year, has focused on returning dividends to investors rather 
than spending money on innovations. 
As a result, BellSouth has lagged behind AT&T as it tries to find a home for itself in the future of 
telecommunications. BellSouth has been slow to pursue a television rollout, unsure about the potential payoff 
and the high investment, while AT&T and Verizon already have announced plans to include television as part of 
their package. BellSouth's only TV offer has been through a marketing alliance with the satellite-TV operator, 
DirecTV Group Inc., El Segundo, Calif. 
BellSouth also hasn't fully embraced a relationship it has with Yahoo. Meanwhile, AT&T has entered deals with 
the Internet company to create a mobile phone, among other services. BellSouth also has resisted deep price 
cuts in its high-speed Internet service. AT&T, by contrast, was the first major phone company to drop monthly 
fees to less than that of slower dial-up services. 
In the wake of the merger, AT&T will push its TV services into BellSouth's systems. AT&T has a venture with 
EchoStar Communications Corp., Englewood, Colo., the other major satellite operator, dubbed HomeZone. 
HomeZone plans to introduce a new set-top box that will enable consumers to get both satellite-TV and movies, 
programs and other content via the Internet. AT&T invested $500 million in EchoStar in 2003 and some investors 
speculate EchoStar may be a future AT&T acquisition target. 
Longer term, AT&T plans to sell TV services on its own network using technology it claims will enable the 
company to offer features and content beyond the reach of cable operators. AT&T has begun a "controlled 
launch" of that service in San Antonio and plans to begin offering it more widely in the next six months or so. 
Neither of AT&T's two TV strategies have fully proven themselves so far. The launch of HomeZone, originally 
scheduled for the end of last year, has been delayed at least six months because of problems integrating the 
satellite and Internet services. Some experts also are skeptical about AT&T's Internet-based TV offerings, citing 
growing pains and the telecommunications industry's poor track record in this field. 
Under the terms of the proposed deal, news of which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal Online, 
shareholders of BellSouth will receive 1.325 shares of AT&T common stock for each BellSouth common share. 
Based on AT&T's closing stock price on March 3, that equals $37.09 a BellSouth common share, or nearly an 
18% premium over BellSouth's closing stock price. The total equity consideration is valued at about $67 billion. 
AT&T's Mr. Whitacre will serve as chairman and chief executive of the new company. His contract expires in 
November when he turns 65, but AT&T said the board asked him to stay on until March 2008 to shepherd the 
acquisition and he agreed to do so. 
Mr. Ackerman of BellSouth will be chairman and chief executive of his company's operations. Mr. Ackerman said 
he would stay on for a short time after the takeover until his retirement. Three members of the BellSouth board 
will join the AT&T board. The corporate headquarters will be in San Antonio, where AT&T is currently based. 
AT&T's board also authorized a share repurchase plan of 400 million shares through 2008. Under this plan, the 
company expects to buy back at least $10 billion of its common shares in the next 22 months. AT&T expects to 
repurchase $2 billion this year and $8 billion next year.

WASHINGTON -- AT&T Inc.'s plan to buy BellSouth Corp. represents a big bet that regulators will approve a 
once-unthinkable telecommunications deal both because of the Bush administration's pro-business stance and 
the increasing competition phone companies now face from cable-television and Internet services. 
The deal's timing, just five months after SBC Communications Inc. completed its acquisition of AT&T, whose 
name it then adopted, suggests that the management of AT&T sees a rare window of opportunity to pull off 
back-to-back transactions. Republicans control the White House and Congress. And the new chairman of the 
Federal Communications Commission has been an unexpectedly strong supporter of the old Bell phone 
companies. 
The Justice Department, meanwhile, has been receptive to megamergers in the phone industry. Last year it 
approved a handful of blockbuster deals without any major concessions, including SBC's deal with AT&T and 
Verizon Communications Inc.'s acquisition of MCI Inc. That might leave it hard-pressed to block an 
AT&T-BellSouth transaction. 
If the FCC follows "the roadmap they wrote last year during the other two mergers, there aren't a lot of speed 
bumps on it for AT&T, and definitely not a brick wall," said Blair Levin, a former FCC official who is now a 
telecommunications analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus &Co. 
Others warn that the latest deal may represent a bridge too far for the industry, mobilizing a more diverse and 
vociferous coalition of opponents than past transactions. Last year's megamergers prompted complaints from 
some consumer groups, business customers and competitors. Now, those foes could join forces with technology 
companies who fear the Bells will use their market dominance and control over access to the Internet to extract 
new revenue for speedy delivery of Internet traffic to consumers. 
Already some phone companies are considering ways of offering guaranteed delivery times for Internet traffic, 
much as FedEx guarantees package delivery. That is a departure from the egalitarian way the Internet has 
worked so far. As a result, technology companies are urging Congress to write into law the principle of "Internet 
neutrality," the idea that all Internet traffic, from simple email messages to lengthy videos, should be treated 
equally. 
Yesterday, even before the deal was officially announced, the Center for Digital Democracy, a Washington group 
that promotes "democratic" broadband access, proclaimed that the transaction would become a "poster child" in 
the "campaign to protect the Net." 
"AT&T wishes to be lord of the digital domain, able to impose a raft of tolls, fees and what they term 
`monetization' strategies for the Internet -- whether it comes to us via wires or wireless devices," said Jeff 
Chester, the group's executive director. 
Opposing interest groups are likely to make their displeasure known to Congress, whose members face elections 
in just eight months. While Republicans might ordinarily be inclined not to kick up much of a fuss, this year's 
election is expected to be bruising, and Republicans may be under pressure to be more populist in their rhetoric 
and possibly more willing to distance themselves from the Bush administration, given President Bush's low 
approval ratings. 
Democrats are clearly itching to push the issue. In a statement, Rep. Edward J. Markey (D., Mass.), the ranking 
Democrat on the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, called the deal "a mother and 
child reunion," and said it "unquestionably merits the utmost scrutiny by government antitrust officials." He added

that "lawmakers should thoroughly review this merger proposal to fully assess its impact on consumers and 
competition." 
The merger partners' best argument may simply be the shifts in the telecommunications landscape since the 
court-ordered 1984 breakup of the old AT&T, once widely known as Ma Bell. In the past decade, long-distance 
phone rates have come down and consumers have many more options for their phone service. The landmark 
1996 Telecommunications Act initially presumed phone companies would start competing head-to-head for 
customers, but the more-enduring alternatives have come from elsewhere. 
Cable companies are increasingly offering phone service as part of their consumer packages. Service 
improvements and well-priced calling plans from wireless carriers have led some to give up their landlines 
entirely. And high-speed broadband connections have sparked a whole new industry that allows voice calls to 
travel over the Internet. 
"The intensity is incredible. These companies are taking tens of thousands of customers from us. We have the 
Vonages, the Voice Over IPs, the Googles, the Yahoos and other wireless carriers. It's very intense, and we 
continue to lose access lines," AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Edward Whitacre said in an interview 
yesterday. "We want a bigger footprint. The world is changing. There is more competition." 
In approving last year's sales of AT&T and MCI to the respective Bell giants SBC and Verizon, Justice 
Department and FCC officials cited the new forms of competition as the reason those combinations wouldn't hurt 
consumer and business customers. 
It is clear that AT&T will make the same argument in defending a BellSouth purchase, and it indicated as much 
in the headline of its news release yesterday announcing the deal. The combination, the company said, "will 
speed innovation, competition and convergence." 
"Technology changes and convergence are shaping a new competitive dynamic and creating tremendous 
opportunity, said Duane Ackerman, chairman and chief executive of BellSouth. "We're creating a company with 
much better capabilities to seize these opportunities." 
Company officials are expected to argue that the economies of scale the combination provides will enable them to 
increase high-speed Internet deployment, a key goal established by President Bush during his 2004 re-election 
campaign, and enable them to provide television signals over those lines, making them a direct competitor to 
cable companies and satellite-television operators. 
For consumer groups and others, the concern is that customers still could be left with just two choices for such 
services -- a cable behemoth versus a telecommunications one. "It demonstrates that more than ever the two 
dominant communications competitive spaces will be represented by cable and phone companies, and it 
increases the weightiness of policy issues, because fewer companies can have an exponentially more dramatic 
impact on the whole country," said Michael K. Powell, who stepped down as FCC chairman last year. 
In addition, the rationale for a BellSouth acquisition differs from SBC's earlier deal with AT&T and Verizon's deal 
with MCI. Those companies were seeing the rapid erosion of the long-distance phone market as they struggled to 
compete against bigger phone and cable rivals. BellSouth, while long considered a takeover target, isn't in 
financial distress. 
At the Justice Department, the review of the latest deal is expected to focus on high-volume data lines that serve 
business customers, especially office buildings and large corporate sites, where the combined companies face 
little competition and would be in a position to raise rates. In last year's AT&T and MCI deals, the department 
required the sale of just a handful of these lines, despite concerns by business users, competitors and consumer 
groups that the deals would lead to higher rates for phone and Internet service. A spokeswoman for the Justice 
Department declined to comment. 
AT&T is likely to count on the track record of Thomas Barnett, the Justice Department's new antitrust chief, who 
oversaw the approval of last year's telecommunications deals and hasn't challenged many mergers. Despite his 
approach, he has come under pressure from some Republican lawmakers and corporate lobbyists to ease 
antitrust enforcement further. 
The Bells also may have an ally in Kevin Martin, an FCC commissioner who took over as the agency's chairman 
last year. Bell executives were wary of him when he was a commissioner, but as chairman he pressed the FCC to 
move ahead promptly on the SBC and Verizon mergers last summer. Mr. Martin advocated approving the deals

Page 85 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
without conditions, a goal he largely accomplished, though the FCC's two Democratic members extracted some 
conditions, including promises to honor Internet-neutrality principles. 
Mr. Martin also infuriated cable companies -- rivals to the Bells -- by launching a review of FCC rules to see if the 
agency could help the Bells' efforts to obtain video-franchising agreements faster, thereby helping them offer 
television service in markets previously served by cable and satellite providers. 
The latest deal will be reviewed by an FCC that includes two new Republicans, Deborah Taylor Tate and Robert 
McDowell, who is awaiting confirmation by the Senate. Both are likely to inject more skepticism into their review of 
the deal. Ms. Tate comes to the commission from Tennessee with a long background in working with state utility 
commissioners, which often did battle with the big local-phone giants over rates, customer service and other 
issues. Mr. McDowell, a veteran telecommunications attorney, currently serves as assistant general counsel at 
Comptel, an association that represents smaller telephone companies trying to compete with the Bells. Comptel 
was a vocal opponent of last year's deals. 
"Nothing about this merger encourages competition," said Earl Comstock, chief executive of Comptel and Mr. 
McDowell's current boss. 
Some of the loudest protests, though, may be about the control AT&T will have over high-speed Internet access 
and whether it plans to charge for faster delivery of content. In both the earlier AT&T and Verizon deals, the FCC 
extracted a promise that the companies would voluntarily comply to the agency's nonenforceable Net-neutrality 
principles for two years. That included the promise that consumers could use the Internet as they chose and 
attach whatever devices they liked to it. 
However, soon after the mergers closed, AT&T executives began publicly complaining about how Internet phone 
competitors like Vonage Holdings Corp. were using AT&T's network free of charge to compete for its customers. 
That has set off concerns in Washington about phone and cable companies using their role as gatekeepers to 
essentially declare the winners and losers of Internet services. 
Though the proposed combination will "create an extraordinary high level of discomfort, there is not an obvious 
basis on which the merger could be blocked," said Mr. Powell, the former FCC chairman. "The sharper focus is 
likely to be on conditions like Net neutrality."

The US telecoms industry was poised last night for major upheaval as AT&T closed in on a deal to acquire 
BellSouth for about $66 billion (54.8 billion). 
The long-expected move will see AT&T consolidate its position as the largest US carrier and take full control of 
Cingular, the two companies' fast-growing wireless joint venture. 
The acquisition marks the latest chapter in the reshaping of the US telecoms industry, where large mergers have 
been the answer to rapid changes in technology and the threat of competition from cable groups. 
Edward Whitacre, chief executive of AT&T, has been the industry's most aggressive player, buying AT&T 
Wireless in 2004 for $41 billion and AT&T itself last year, in a $16 billion deal that allowed his company SBC 
Communications to take the AT&T name. 
People familiar with the talks between AT&T and BellSouth said they had reached an advanced stage by 
yesterday, and that a deal would be announced imminently. 
AT&T is expected to pay about $37 per share in stock for BellSouth, or an 18 per cent premium over the 
company's share price of $31.46 on Friday night. AT&T will also agree to take on about $1 7billion of BellSouth 
debt. 
Although an AT&T takeover of BellSouth has long been expected, many telecoms industry watchers yesterday 
expressed surprise that an announcement had come so soon after the combination of SBC and AT&T. 
News of the discussions immediately triggered speculation that the deal could spark a round of consolidation 
among the largest telecoms equipment makers, such as Lucent and Nortel. - (Financial Times Service)

AT&T deal for BellSouth recreates Eighties US monopoly

AT&T deal for BellSouth recreates Eighties US monopoly

The US telecommunications landscape was redrawn last night after two of the country's biggest groups joined 
forces in a $67bn deal that recreated a monopoly last seen 20 years ago. 
AT&T, the number one telecoms operator, is buying BellSouth for $37.09 per share to expand its foothold in the 
country's south-east and give it full control of Cingular Wireless. The enlarged group will dominate the telecoms 
industry, fending off the threat of competition from cable groups. 
Edward Whitacre, AT&T's chairman and chief executive, said the deal would strengthen Cingular, America's 
biggest mobile phone carrier, "through unified ownership and a single brand". Previously BellSouth owned 40 per 
cent of the mobile operator. 
A stronger Cingular, which will be re-branded to take the AT&T name when the deal closes, will pile the pressure 
on its rival Verizon. 
Analysts believe last night's deal could be the catalyst for Verizon, which will be dwarfed by AT&T, to take full 
control of Verizon Wireless, its joint venture with Vodafone. Vodafone has a 45 per cent interest in the US's 
number two mobile carrier but is known to be considering pulling out of the US following calls from investors for it 
to sell its stake and hand back the cash. 
AT&T hopes to achieve annual cost savings of more than $2bn from the takeover, which is the industry's biggest 
since Bell Atlantic bought GTE Corp for $71bn to create Verizon in 2000. It follows hard on the heels of last year's 
combination of AT&T and SBC Communications in a $16bn deal. 
Duane Ackerman, chairman and chief executive of BellSouth, said: "Technology changes and convergences are 
shaping a new competitive dynamic and creating tremendous opportunity. We're creating a company with much 
better capabilities to seize these opportunities." 
Analysts said that AT&T's move has been long expected but warned that it will require regulatory approval from 
anti-trust authorities as well as from the Federal Communications Commission. The tie-up is expected to get a 
green light despite recreating a monopoly that was broken up by the courts in 1984. 
The acquisition is the latest in a long line of audacious moves by Mr Whitacre, who hopes to close the deal within 
the next 12 months.

When Edward Whitacre was plotting last year to take over AT&T, the rumour in Washington was that the chief 
executive of what was then still called SBC had an audacious plan: his Texas telecoms company would also 
make a bid for BellSouth, in effect reversing the 1980s break-up of Ma Bell. 
Mr Whitacre was talked out of the plan, in part because it was unclear how regulators at the Federal 
Communications Commission and antitrust officials at the Department of Justice would receive SBC's Dollars 
16bn takeover of AT&T, let alone another acquisition. 
But any lingering doubts about the Bush administration's view on telecoms mergers evaporated last November, 
when both the FCC and DOJ approved the joining of SBC and AT&T, and Verizon's acquisition of MCI without 
any onerous conditions. 
For analysts and antitrust attorneys, approval of the deals by FCC chairman Kevin Martin underscored how vastly 
the competitive landscape in the communications sector has changed since 1997, when then FCC chairman 
Reed Hundt said a reconfiguration of Ma Bell was "unthinkable". 
The emergence of wireless and voice over internet services over the past few years means traditional industry 
lines have blurred, they say, and that telecoms companies and other groups have successfully argued that the 
build-up of bigger communications networks to fuel the economy requires more investment - and biggercoffers. 
Andrew Lipman, an attorney with Bingham McCutchen in Washington, says, from AT&T's perspective, the stars in 
Washington are aligned for a takeover of BellSouth, given Republican domination of the Congress and White 
House. 
"The companies can probably expect similar conditions as the previous mergers," Mr Lipman says, noting it would 
most likely take a year for AT&T's takeover of BellSouth to receive regulatory approval. 
Mr Whitacre faces one significant advantage in his bid to take over BellSouth that he did not have last year: a 
Republican majority at the FCC. 
The nomination of Robert McDowell, a former telecoms lobbyist, at the FCC last month will give Mr Martin the 
majority of votes he needs at the commission to approve the merger with even fewer conditions than last year. 
At the time, the FCC chairman said he did not believe that even the few conditions that were set on AT&T and 
Verizon were necessary, and that the mergers would provide incentives for the companies to invest in broadband 
infrastructure. 
Although Mr McDowell technically opposed SBC's takeover of AT&T last year, when he served as general 
counsel of the Competitive Telecommunications Association, which represents alternative telecoms carriers, two 
antitrust attorneys yesterday said Mr McDowell would most likely seek to distance himself from his former industry 
ties and support the deals. 
One Washington regulatory attorney says the transaction is unlikely to face much opposition from other industry 
lobbyists, even if some groups, such as the cable industry, are unhappy with the merger.

Although speculation on Wall Street is rife that the deal would trigger a take-over bid by Verizon of Qwest, two 
attorneys yesterday said AT&T's move did not suggest another deal by Verizon was inevitable. 
Instead, the deal could compel companies across the communications sector, including the satellite companies, 
to rethink their strategies and pursue mergers to compete against the resurrected telecoms behemoth: Ma Bell.

The deal between AT&T and BellSouth to create a company with combined market capitalisation of Dollars 
150bn raised expectations of futher industry consolidation. Among the implications was the possibility of 
increased internet access charges. AT&T chief executive Edward Whitacre had already made himself unpopular 
with the proponents of 'network neutrality', or giving consumers open access to all Internet sites and services. 
Whitacre earnt himself the nickname "my pipes" after he said last year: "Why should they be allowed to use my 
pipes? The Internet can't be free in that sense, because we and the cable companies have made an investment, 
and for a Google or Yahoo or Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes (for) free is nuts!" 
*Former Goldman Sachs partner and internet analyst Michael Parekh believed the deal would get more scrutiny 
than previous ones "due partly to the current "net neutrality" debate" (mp.blogs.com) 
*In honour of Oscar night, writer and consultant Paul Kapustka proposed the telecoms industry version of the 
"Whitacres" instead of golden statuettes. "The Whitacre goes to: Whichever regulator/lawmaker is first to utter the 
phrase that the AT&T/BellSouth takeover "will actually increase competition" for services". There was also an 
award for Vonage Holdings, for the "holding pattern for an IPO that may not ever happen." paulsblog.pulver.com

The US telecoms industry was poised last night for major upheaval as AT&T closed in on a deal to acquire 
BellSouth for about Dollars 66bn. 
The long-expected move will see AT&T consolidate its position as the largest US carrier and take full control of 
Cingular, the two companies' fast-growing wireless joint venture. 
The acquisition marks the latest chapter in the reshaping of the US telecoms industry, where large mergers have 
been the answer to rapid changes in technology and the threat of competition from cable groups. 
Edward Whitacre, chief executive of AT&T, has been the industry's most aggressive player, buying AT&T 
Wireless in 2004 for Dollars 41bn and AT&T itself last year, in a Dollars 16bn deal that allowed his company SBC 
Communications to take the AT&T name. 
People familiar with the talks between AT&T and BellSouth said they had reached an advanced stage by 
yesterday, and that a deal would be announced imminently. AT&T is expected to pay about Dollars 37 per share 
in stock for BellSouth, or an 18 per cent premium over the company's share price of Dollars 31.46 on Friday 
night. AT&T will also agree to take on about Dollars 17bn of BellSouth debt. 
Although an AT&T takeover of BellSouth has long been expected, many telecoms industry watchers yesterday 
expressed surprise that an announcement had come so soon after the combination of SBC and AT&T. News of 
the discussions immediately triggered speculation that the deal could spark a round of consolidation among the 
largest telecoms equipment makers, such as Lucent and Nortel. 
It could also put pressure on Verizon - which will be only half of AT&T's size in terms of market capitalisation after 
the transaction - to react with a big deal. 
This could entail Verizon pursuing a takeover of rival Qwest or entering swift discussions with the UK's Vodafone 
to take full control of Verizon Wireless, their mobile phone joint venture, observers said. Since last year, Verizon 
has been busy integrating its acquisition of MCI for nearly Dollars 10bn, which gave it access to a vast network of 
long-distance and business customer. 
By combining overhead and marketing costs, as well as AT&T and BellSouth's local phone networks, which 
together stretch from California to Florida, the companies are expecting to generate at least Dollars 10bn in 
savings, said a person close to the talks. 
A key motivation behind the merger appears to be the fast growth experienced by Cingular Wireless, their 50-50 
mobile phone joint venture, which will be rebranded to take the AT&T name when the deal closes. 
After the deal is announced, AT&T will move to gain regulatory approval for the transaction, which reverses the 
break-up of "Ma Bell" sought by the US government in the 1980s. In recent years, the Federal Communications 
Commission has encouraged telecoms mergers, recognising that the competitive landscape has changed. 
Based in Georgia and run by Duane Ackerman, BellSouth had been absent from the last round of telecoms 
consolidation. Last year, it generated Dollars 3.3bn in net income from Dollars 20.5bn in revenue.

AT&T nears deal to buy BellSouth for $65 billion

AT&T Inc. is nearing the acquisition of BellSouth Corp. for roughly $65 billion, people familiar with the situation 
said, as intense competition between phone and cable companies is reshaping the communications landscape. 
The two companies, whose latest round of merger talks started a month ago, were expected to announce a deal 
by today. The acquisition would create a U.S. telecommunications titan with a market capitalization of nearly $160 
billion, larger than Vodafone Group PLC of the U.K. 
The move marks the latest blockbuster expansion for the former SBC Communications Inc., which in the past two 
years acquired AT&T Wireless and AT&T Corp. before renaming itself AT&T Inc. at the beginning of this year. A 
deal, if approved by regulators, will give AT&T full control of Cingular Wireless, a joint venture with BellSouth. 
People close to AT&T say the company plans to phase out the Cingular brand name in favor of the AT&T brand. 
AT&T is targeting at least $2 billion in annual cost savings in the BellSouth deal, said a person familiar with the 
matter yesterday. The company will pay about $37 per share for BellSouth, representing about an 18% premium 
to BellSouth's share price of $31.46 at 4 p.m. Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The total equity value of 
the deal is at least $65 billion, plus the assumption of an additional $17 billion of BellSouth debt. 
Spokespeople for BellSouth and AT&T declined to comment. 
An AT&T-BellSouth deal would leave the U.S. with two large telecom companies, each vertically integrated with 
a local phone operation, business services, and a wireless unit. And it would effectively validate the vision of 
competition laid out by the government -- one in which traditional telecom companies compete directly against 
cable operators as well as against each other. The deal would nonetheless set up a showdown between AT&T 
and Verizon Communications Inc., which recently acquired MCI Inc., as the two fight to control the wireless 
business, the growth portion of the telecom business. 
It was the steep growth of Cingular -- jointly owned by BellSouth and the former SBC -- that helped push the two 
companies together, say telecom bankers. As the importance of the wireless business grew, they say, it became 
inevitable that the new AT&T would consolidate its position in the Southern U.S., where BellSouth has a 
stronghold. 
Put together, the new AT&T territory would extend from California to Florida, north to Illinois and south to Texas. 
AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Edward Whitacre has made a name for himself in the telecommunications 
industry as a serial acquirer. Mr. Whitacre is able to boast of a string of acquisitions including Pacific Telesis 
Corp., Ameritech Corp. and Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. But as he nears retirement the 
market had been anticipating one last hurrah from him; a BellSouth acquisition by AT&T has long been the 
subject of speculation from analysts, investors and the two companies' rivals. 
Still, the speedy move to acquire BellSouth came as a surprise so soon after Mr. Whitacre's takeover of AT&T 
Corp. last fall. His company is just starting to digest the $16 billion acquisition. The new company dominates 
nearly every aspect of the industry, from high-speed Internet connections to long-distance phone service, as well 
as wireless. And Mr. Whitacre now has access to the old AT&T's enterprise business and world-wide network. 
An AT&T-BellSouth deal would likely prompt howls of protest in some quarters as it comes on the heels not only 
of the AT&T-SBC deal but also after Verizon's acquisition of MCI. Those deals were approved with only a few 
minor conditions despite concerns they would lead to higher prices for business customers.

Page 94 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The wave of mergers has dramatically reshaped the telecom industry, and a purchase of BellSouth would further 
cement the recreation of the old Ma Bell, which the government pushed to break up in 1984. 
The management of AT&T, which apparently briefed key senior government officials late last week, appears to be 
betting that President George W. Bush's administration and a Federal Communications Commission friendly to 
the large U.S. phone companies won't raise too many obstacles for such a deal, arguing that the companies 
serve different geographic regions and don't currently compete with one another in a significant way. 
However, the FCC that would review an AT&T-BellSouth deal will likely be a much different body soon with the 
addition of Robert McDowell, a veteran telecom lawyer who currently serves as assistant general counsel at 
Comptel, which represents smaller telephone companies and was a vocal opponent of the AT&T and Verizon 
mergers last year. 
Mr. McDowell is scheduled to appear before a Senate committee Thursday for his confirmation and is likely to be 
asked about the merger.

PHILADELPHIA/WASHINGTON (Reuters)-Telecommunications giant AT&T Inc. is close to an agreement to 
acquire BellSouth Corp. for about $65 billion, a deal that would recombine Ma Bell with four of the seven original 
Baby Bells, sources familiar with the situation said on Sunday. An announcement of the long-expected deal, 
which would bring the Cingular Wireless joint venture under one roof, is expected later on Sunday, said the 
sources, declining to be identified by name. 
Together, AT&T and BellSouth would have a national long-distance telephone and data network, residential 
customers stretching from Connecticut to Florida to California and business customers comprising more than half 
of the Fortune 1000, analysts have said. 
AT&T declined to comment, while BellSouth could not be immediately reached for comment. AT&T recently was 
formed when SBC Communications Inc. acquired AT&T Corp. in a $16 billion deal. 
The newly combined company would be trailed by Verizon Communications, which last year bought MCI 
Inc.Qwest Communications International Inc., the final remaining Baby Bell, covers Minnesota to Washington 
state. 
AT&T owns 60 percent of the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier Cingular Wireless, while BellSouth owns the remaining 
40 percent. A deal would bring that prized asset under one company, which Wall Street analysts have said would 
streamline management, make Cingular more nimble and allow one parent company to enjoy all of the financial 
benefit. 
As traditional landline telephone businesses have been waning, telephone companies have focused on wireless 
and data services as new sources of growth. 
AT&T and other major telephone companies also have been upgrading their networks to offer 
subscription-television services to thwart competition from cable TV operators, which are offering phone services. 
AT&T in January began offering video in Texas and plans to expand service to 21 cities in its home territory this 
year. 
DEAL TO FACE REGULATORY SCRUTINY 
Any deal would require approval from antitrust authorities as well as the Federal Communications Commission. 
"The deal is likely to be approved," said Blair Levin, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus and a former Federal 
Communications Commission chief of staff. "The government has already given us a road map and it had very 
few speedbumps and much less brick walls for this kind of transaction." 
He said the government would likely seek similar conditions to this transaction that were placed on the 
AT&T-SBC deal, which included providing competitors access to some buildings, some price controls, and 
ensuring customers have unfettered access to the Internet. 
Government approval for "this one should be a little bit faster," Levin said. It took the FCC approximately eight 
months to review the AT&T-SBC deal. 
WHITACRE'S LATEST DEAL

For Edward Whitacre, chairman and chief executive of the new AT&T, a deal would be the latest of a long line of 
bold acquisitions. 
At SBC, Whitacre had acquired regional Baby Bell companies Pacific Telesis and Ameritech Corp. He also 
helped orchestrate the $41 billion purchase of AT&T Wireless by Cingular Wireless, the No. 1 U.S. wireless 
carrier. 
While at SBC, Whitacre previously had weighed buying BellSouth, but shifted to the purchase of AT&T, sources 
familiar with the situation had said.

(Updates with additional details) 
By Dionne Searcey, Amy Schatz, Almar Latour and Dennis Berman 
Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--AT&T Inc. (T) is nearing the acquisition of BellSouth Corp. (BLS) for roughly $65 
billion, people familiar with the situation said Saturday evening. A deal could be announced as early as Monday, 
these people said. 
AT&T is targeting at least $2 billion in cost savings in the BellSouth deal, said a person familiar with the matter 
Sunday. AT&T also plans to phase out the Cingular wireless brand name and use the AT&T name. 
AT&T will pay about $37 per share for BellSouth, representing about an 18 percent premium to BellSouth's 
share price Friday. The total equity value of the deal is at least $65 billion, plus the assumption of an additional 
$17 billion of BellSouth debt. 
Spokespeople for BellSouth and AT&T declined to comment. 
An AT&T-BellSouth deal would effectively cleave the nation's telecom services in two, each vertically integrated 
with a local phone operation, business services, and wireless unit. And it would effectively validate the vision of 
competition laid out by the government - one in which traditional telecom firms compete directly against cable 
operators rather than against each other. The move would give AT&T Inc. sole control over Cingular, the nation's 
largest wireless operator. 
A combination between AT&T and BellSouth could have combined market capitalization of nearly $160 billion, 
making AT&T far larger than rival Verizon. The deal would nonetheless set a showdown between AT&T and 
Verizon, as the two fight to control wireless, the growth portion of the telecom business. 
It was the steep growth of Cingular - joint owned by BellSouth and the former SBC - that helped push the two 
firms together, say telecom bankers familiar with the space. As the importance of the wireless business grew, 
they say, it became inevitable that SBC (which adopted the AT&T name just months ago) would consolidate its 
position in the South. Put together, the SBC territory would extend from California to Florida, north to Illinois and 
south to Texas. 
AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Edward Whitacre has made a name for himself in the telecommunications 
industry as a serial acquirer. 
Mr. Whitacre is able to boast of a string of acquisitions including Pacific Telesis Corp., Ameritech Corp. and 
Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. But as he nears retirement the market had been anticipating 
one last hurrah from him; a BellSouth acquisition by AT&T has long been the subject of speculation from 
analysts, investors and the two companies' rivals. 
Still the speedy move to acquire BellSouth came as a surprise so soon after Mr. Whitacre's takeover of AT&T 
Corp. last fall. His company is just starting to digest the $16 billion acquisition. The former SBC Communications 
Inc. took over AT&T Corp. and adopted the AT&T moniker. The new company dominates nearly every aspect of 
the industry, from high-speed Internet connections to long-distance phone service, as well as wireless. And Mr. 
Whitacre now has access to the old AT&T's enterprise business and world-wide network.

Page 99 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Such a deal would likely prompt howls of protest in some quarters as it comes on the heels not only of the 
AT&T-SBC deal but also after Verizon Communications Inc.'s acquisition of MCI. Those deals were approved with 
only a few minor conditions despite concerns they would lead to higher prices for business customers. 
The wave of mergers has dramatically reshaped the telecom industry, and a purchase of BellSouth would further 
cement the recreation of the old Ma Bell, which the government pushed to break up in 1984. 
The management of AT&T, which has apparently briefed key senior government officials late last week, appears 
to be betting that the Bush administration and a Bell-friendly Federal Communications Commission won't raise too 
many obstacles for such a deal, arguing that the companies serve different geographic regions and do not 
currently compete with one another in a significant way. 
Although AT&T and Verizon's last mergers passed both FCC and Justice Department review with little major 
problems, the latest proposed merger may face more hurdles. Recent comments by AT&T and BellSouth 
executives about their intentions to explore new revenue streams from their high-speed Internet services by 
introducing two-tier or "premium" service for Internet content providers. Concerns about those plans and the 
concept of "net neutrality," or ensuring that consumers have open access to all Internet sites and services and 
businesses do not find their content slowed, has become a major problems for the Bells in Washington. 
Meanwhile, the FCC that will be reviewing the AT&T/BellSouth deal will likely be a much different body soon with 
the addition of Robert McDowell, a veteran telecom lawyer who currently serves as assistant general counsel at 
Comptel, which represents smaller telephone companies and was a vocal opponent of the AT&T and Verizon 
mergers last year. 
Mr. McDowell is scheduled to appear before a Senate committee on Thursday for his confirmation and is likely to 
be asked about the merger. Although Mr. McDowell is a Republican, his nomination to the FCC was met with 
noticeable unease by the Bell companies, which have privately expressed some concern his experience working 
with smaller competitors may make him less than sympathetic to their concerns.

UPDATE 7-AT&T agrees to buy BellSouth for $67 billion

(Recasts paragraphs 1-2, 11-12) 
PHILADELPHIA, March 5 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. said on Sunday it would buy BellSouth Corp. for $67 billion to 
acquire the rest of Cingular Wireless it does not already own, and expand into the southeastern United States to 
gain heft to battle growing competition from cable television and Internet companies. 
Together, AT&T and BellSouth would have a coast-to-coast long-distance telephone and data network, 
residential customers in 22 states and business customers comprising more than half of the Fortune 1000, 
analysts said. 
BellSouth shareholders will receive 1.325 shares of AT&T common stock for each common share of BellSouth. 
Based on AT&T's closing stock price on March 3, that equals $37.09 per BellSouth common share, a 
17.9-percent premium. 
The new AT&T, which was formed in November when SBC Communications Inc. completed its acquisition of 
AT&T Corp., also said it would repurchase at least $10 billion of its common shares over the next 22 months. 
The deal's price tag, which values BellSouth at about 6.9-times Wall Street's 2006 cash-flow forecasts, will likely 
weigh on AT&T's stock price, said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Chris King. 
"We believe this premium valuation ... is difficult to justify," King said. AT&T trades at about 6.0-times cash flow, 
while Verizon trades at about 5.1-times cash flow. 
The companies have a combined market capitalization of $165 billion, based on Friday's closing stock prices. 
The next largest telephone company, Verizon Communications , which bought MCI Inc. last year, has a market 
capitalization of $99 billion. 
The deal would bring ownership of Cingular Wireless, the No. 1 U.S. wireless telephone company, under one 
roof, which Wall Street analysts have said would streamline management and allow one parent company to enjoy 
all of the financial benefits. 
AT&T currently owns 60 percent of Cingular, while BellSouth owns the remaining 40 percent. Despite its heft, 
Cingular has been losing market share of the most lucrative, customers to its main rival, Verizon Wireless. 
At the completion of the deal, which is expected to close within a year, all the landline and wireless businesses 
will exist under the sole brand name of AT&T, the companies said. 
A purchase of BellSouth would recombine the former "Ma Bell" with four of the seven original Baby Bells regional 
telephone companies. 
Two top consumer groups asked the government to block the deal, saying it could lead to higher prices. AT&T 
said the deal would result in a "very competitive company," especially in wireless and video services. 
AT&T, whose history dates back more than 125 years to the invention of the telephone, was broken up in 1984, 
with the parent controlling the long-distance assets and its seven offspring controlling regional local telephone 
services.

"This is essentially re-creating the old AT&T. But in this environment, the industry has been so weakened, with so 
many competing technologies, it's a very, very different world now," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of 
Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York. 
"It will strengthen two companies that aren't particularly strong. The industry needs that consolidation to make 
them stronger against competing technologies," Ghriskey said. 
As traditional landline phone businesses have been hurt by a shift to e-mail and wireless phones, telephone 
carriers have shifted their focus to faster growing businesses such as wireless and data services. 
AT&T and other major telephone companies also have been upgrading their networks to offer 
subscription-television services to thwart competition from cable TV operators, which are offering phone services. 
AT&T in January began offering video in Texas and plans to expand service to 21 cities in its home territory this 
year. 
DEAL TO FACE REGULATORY SCRUTINY 
A merged AT&T-BellSouth would be trailed by Verizon Communications , which last year bought MCI Inc. Qwest 
Communications International Inc. , the final remaining Baby Bell, covers Minnesota to Washington state. 
Any deal would require approval from antitrust authorities as well as the Federal Communications Commission, 
but analysts said they doubted there would be significant opposition. 
"The deal is likely to be approved," said Blair Levin, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus and a former Federal 
Communications Commission chief of staff. "The government has already given us a road map and it had very 
few speed bumps and much less brick walls for this kind of transaction." 
He said the government would likely seek similar conditions on this transaction that were placed on the 
AT&T-SBC deal, which included some price controls, as well as providing competitors access to some buildings 
and ensuring customers have unfettered access to the Internet. 
AT&T expects the deal to be neutral to earnings per share in 2007, and boost earnings per share, excluding 
merger costs and other items, thereafter. 
Cost-savings are expected to top $2 billion in the second year after closing the deal, and total nearly $18 billion, 
AT&T said. The savings will come from an undisclosed amount of work force cuts, lower advertising expenses 
and cheaper operating costs as the companies merge operations to one network. 
WHITACRE'S LATEST DEAL 
For Edward Whitacre, chairman and chief executive of the new AT&T, a deal would be the latest of a long line of 
bold acquisitions. A purchase of BellSouth by the new AT&T had been long-expected by Wall Street, but the 
announcement came sooner than some analysts predicted -- just three months after SBC completed the 
purchase of AT&T. 
Whitacre, who was expected to retire around the end of this year, was asked to stay until March 2008, AT&T said. 
He will serve as chairman of the combined companies, while BellSouth Chairman Duane Ackerman will head 
BellSouth operations for a transition period following the merger, the companies said.

AT&T said on Sunday it would buy BellSouth for $67bn to expand its reach into the south-eastern United States 
and acquire the rest of Cingular Wireless it does not already own. 
BellSouth shareholders will receive 1.325 shares of AT&T common stock for each common share of BellSouth. 
Based on AT&T's closing stock price on Friday, that equals $37.09 per BellSouth common share, a 17.9-per cent 
premium. 
The long-expected move will see AT&T consolidate its position as the largest US carrier and take full control of 
Cingular, the two companies' fast-growing wireless joint venture. 
The acquisition marks the latest chapter in the reshaping of the US telecoms industry, where large mergers have 
been the answer to rapid changes in technology and the threat of competition from cable groups. 
Verizon - which will be only half of AT&T's size in terms of market capitalisation after the transaction - is likely to 
come under pressure to react with its own big deal. 
This could entail Verizon pursuing a takeover of rival Qwest or entering swift discussions with the UK's Vodafone 
to take full control of Verizon Wireless, their mobile phone joint venture, observers said. Since last year, Verizon 
has been busy integrating its acquisition of MCI for nearly $10bn, which gave it access to a vast network of 
long-distance and business customers. 
Edward Whitacre, chief executive of AT&T, has been the industry's most aggressive player, buying AT&T 
Wireless in 2004 for $41bn and AT&T itself last year, in a $16bn deal that allowed his company SBC 
Communications to take the AT&T name. 
AT&T will also agree to take on about $17bn of BellSouth debt. 
Although an AT&T takeover of BellSouth has long been expected, many telecoms industry watchers expressed 
surprise that an announcement had come so soon after the combination of SBC and AT&T. News of the 
discussions immediately triggered speculation that the deal could spark a round of consolidation among the 
largest telecoms equipment makers, such as Lucent and Nortel. 
By combining overhead and marketing costs, as well as AT&T and BellSouth's local phone networks, which 
together stretch from California to Florida, the companies are expecting to generate at least $10bn in savings, 
said a person close to the talks. 
A key motivation behind the merger appears to be the fast growth experienced by Cingular Wireless, their 50-50 
mobile phone joint venture, which will be rebranded to take the AT&T name when the deal closes. 
AT&T will move to gain regulatory approval for the transaction, which reverses the break-up of "Ma Bell" sought 
by the US government in the 1980s. In recent years, the Federal Communications Commission has encouraged 
telecoms mergers, recognising that the competitive landscape has changed. 
Based in Georgia and run by Duane Ackerman, BellSouth had been absent from the last round of telecoms 
consolidation. Last year, it generated $3.3bn in net income from $20.5bn in revenue.

AT&T's supremacy in the telecommunications industry seems assured following its transformation into the largest 
US telecoms group on the back of a $67bn acquisition of rival BellSouth. 
The group has been rebuilt into a company with broad similarities to the government-sanctioned monopoly that 
was broken up more than 20 years ago, but, in terms of its scale and geographic reach, the competitive 
landscape has changed beyond all recognition from that period. 
Just a few decades ago the telecoms business was defined by the provision of voice connections over wires, 
locally or internationally. 
Today the traditional wireline business is declining, overtaken by strong growth in wireless phone services, 
high-speed internet connections and the transmission of data. 
Already, telecoms groups are venturing into a fourth area: providing the video and multi-channel television 
services currently dominated by cable and satellite operators. 
This means competition is not just between traditional telecoms groups such as AT&T and Verizon 
Communications - the number two in the US - but also cable operators. 
"AT&T will be competing to provide a full bundle of telecommunications services on an increasingly national 
scale," said Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS. "This is going to be a four-player race between AT&T, Verizon, 
Comcast and Time Warner." 
At the start of last year, there were doubts that the once-dominant AT&T could even survive. Its profitable 
businesses declined after the forced break-up of "Ma Bell" into regional "Baby Bells". 
SBC Communications, the Texas-based regional telecoms group that began as one of the "Baby Bells", acquired 
AT&T for $16bn just over a year ago. By then, AT&T's business was mainly focused on corporate clients. It was 
well regarded by its global customer base although competition had pushed pricing in this sector so low that it 
was largely unprofitable. 
Edward Whitacre, the chairman and chief executive of SBC who has spearheaded the group's $200bn 
acquisition spree, decided to rename the entire company AT&T last year, thus ensuring the survival of a name 
closely linked with the development of telephony itself. 
Now, AT&T is planning to rebrand its Cingular wireless services as AT&T, and facilitate the bundling of wired and 
wireless services. 
The bundling of services has so far reduced the churn rate for telecoms and cable companies, a key factor in 
terms of the profitability of customers. 
"Together, we will lead the way into a new era of converged and bundled communications, video and 
entertainment services while also improving our ability to manage complex networks," said Mr Whitacre 
yesterday, when the deal was announced. 
The AT&T and BellSouth combination is not expected to immediately effect pricing in the wired or wireless 
sectors, analysts said.

When Edward Whitacre was plotting last year to take over AT&T, the rumour in Washington was that the chief 
executive of what was then still called SBC had an audacious plan: his Texas telecoms company would also 
make a bid for BellSouth, in effect reversing the 1980s break-up of Ma Bell. 
Mr Whitacre was talked out of the plan, in part because it was unclear how regulators at the Federal 
Communications Commission and antitrust officials at the Department of Justice would receive SBC's $16bn 
takeover of AT&T, let alone another acquisition. 
But any lingering doubts about the Bush administration's view on telecoms mergers evaporated last November, 
when both the FCC and DOJ approved the joining of SBC and AT&T, and Verizon's acquisition of MCI without 
any onerous conditions. 
For analysts and antitrust attorneys, approval of the deals by FCC chairman Kevin Martin underscored how vastly 
the competitive landscape in the communications sector has changed since 1997, when then FCC chairman 
Reed Hundt said a reconfiguration of Ma Bell was "unthinkable". 
The emergence of wireless and voice over internet services over the past few years means traditional industry 
lines have blurred, they say, and that telecoms companies and other groups have successfully argued that the 
build-up of bigger communications networks to fuel the economy requires more investment - and biggercoffers. 
Andrew Lipman, an attorney with Bingham McCutchen in Washington, says, from AT&T's perspective, the stars in 
Washington are aligned for a takeover of BellSouth, given Republican domination of the Congress and White 
House. 
"The companies can probably expect similar conditions as the previous mergers," Mr Lipman says, noting it would 
most likely take a year for AT&T's takeover of BellSouth to receive regulatory approval. 
Mr Whitacre faces one significant advantage in his bid to take over BellSouth that he did not have last year: a 
Republican majority at the FCC. 
The nomination of Robert McDowell, a former telecoms lobbyist, at the FCC last month will give Mr Martin the 
majority of votes he needs at the commission to approve the merger with even fewer conditions than last year. 
At the time, the FCC chairman said he did not believe that even the few conditions that were set on AT&T and 
Verizon were necessary, and that the mergers would provide incentives for the companies to invest in broadband 
infrastructure. 
Although Mr McDowell technically opposed SBC's takeover of AT&T last year, when he served as general 
counsel of the Competitive Telecommunications Association, which represents alternative telecoms carriers, two 
antitrust attorneys yesterday said Mr McDowell would most likely seek to distance himself from his former industry 
ties and support the deals. 
One Washington regulatory attorney says the transaction is unlikely to face much opposition from other industry 
lobbyists, even if some groups, such as the cable industry, are unhappy with the merger. 
Although speculation on Wall Street is rife that the deal would trigger a take-over bid by Verizon of Qwest, two 
attorneys yesterday said AT&T's move did not suggest another deal by Verizon was inevitable.

Instead, the deal could compel companies across the communications sector, including the satellite companies, 
to rethink their strategies and pursue mergers to compete against the resurrected telecoms behemoth: Ma Bell.

Edward Whitacre has barely paused for breath. Only months after completing the acquisition of AT&T, and using 
its iconic brand to replace SBC Communications, the deal-hungry chief executive is at it again. In yet another 
move towards reassembling the pieces of Ma Bell, he is buying telecoms operator BellSouth. 
It was always a matter of when, not if, the deal would happen. There are the usual - if unexciting - purchasing, 
engineering, branding and head office savings from putting the fixed-line operations together. But the real juice is 
in wireless, the main growth engine for US telecoms operators, and in long distance. 
Most importantly, AT&T gets full control of Cingular, the wireless operator it currently shares with BellSouth. That 
will boost AT&T's exposure to faster-growing wireless revenues and allow for the elimination of some duplicated 
costs. It also gives AT&T full flexibility to control Cingular's destiny in the rapidly-changing telecoms industry and 
to bundle its wireless and fixed-line services more easily. 
In long-distance, meanwhile, the enlarged group can replicate in the BellSouth footprint some of the huge cost 
savings that the AT&T/SBC combination is already enjoying. With all that, AT&T should be able to tell a 
convincing story on how expected synergies justify an 18 per cent premium being paid to BellSouth. 
There are clearly execution risks. Regulators will take a close look. But unifying Cingular's ownership is hard to 
argue with. And the limited overlap in AT&T and BellSouth's footprints, coupled with increasing competition from 
cable operators, gives the deal a decent chance of getting though with limited concessions. 
That leaves the question of knock-on effects. When SBC bid for AT&T, it bounced rival Verizon into buying MCI, 
the other main long-distance operator. Now that Mr Whitacre has again led the way, Ivan Seidenberg is left 
panting to keep up. He will surely feel extra pressure to take full control of Verizon Wireless. If Vodafone, his 
minority partner, is ready to dismantle its global empire, its negotiating position in the US just got better.

The US telecoms industry was on Sunday night poised for major upheaval as AT&Tclosed in on a deal to acquire 
BellSouth for about $66bn. 
In a long-expected move, AT&T will consolidate its position as the largest US telecoms carrier and take full 
control of Cingular, the two companies' fast-growing wireless joint venture. 
The acquisition marks the latest chapter in the reshaping of the US telecoms industry, where large mergers have 
been the answer to rapid changes in technology and the threat of competition from cable groups. 
Edward Whitacre, chief executive of AT&T, has been the most aggressive player in the industry, snapping up 
AT&T Wireless in 2004 for $41bn and AT&T itself in a $16bn deal last year that allowed his company, SBC 
Communications, to take the AT&T name. 
People familiar with the talks between AT&T and BellSouth said they had reached an advanced stage by 
Sunday, and a deal would be announced imminently. AT&T is expected to pay about $37 per share in stock for 
BellSouth, or an 18 per cent premium over the company's share price of $31.46 on Friday night. AT&T will also 
agree to take on about $17bn of BellSouth debt. 
Although an AT&T takeover of BellSouth has long been expected, many telecoms industry watchers on Sunday 
expressed surprise that an announcement had come so soon after the combination of SBC and AT&T. News of 
the discussions immediately triggered speculation that the deal could spark a round of consolidation among the 
largest telecoms equipment makers, such as Lucent and Nortel. 
It could also put pressure on Verizon - which will be only half of AT&T's size in terms of market capitalisation after 
the transaction closes - to react with a big deal. 
This could entail Verizon pursuing a takeover of rival Qwest or enter swift discussions with the UK's Vodafone to 
take full control of Verizon Wireless, their mobile phone joint venture, observers said. Since last year, Verizon has 
been busy integrating its acquisition of MCI for nearly $10bn, which allowed it to gain access to a vast network of 
long-distance and business customers. 
By combining overhead and marketing costs, as well as AT&T and BellSouth's local phone networks, which 
together stretch from California to Florida, the companies are expecting to generate at least $10bn in savings, 
said one person close the talks. 
A key motivation behind the merger appears to be the fast growth experienced by Cingular Wireless, their 50-50 
mobile phone joint venture, which will be rebranded to take the AT&T name when the deal closes. 
After the deal is announced, AT&T will move to gain regulatory approval for the transaction, which reverses the 
break-up of "Ma Bell" sought by the US government in the 1980s. In recent years, the Federal Communications 
Commission has encouraged telecoms mergers, recognising that the competitive landscape has changed. In 
particular, the largest cable companies such as Time Warner and Comcast have been aggressively moving to 
provide "triple-play" packages including cable, internet and telephone services, in a direct challenge to telephone 
companies. 
Based in Georgia and run by Duane Ackerman, BellSouth had been absent from the last round of telecoms 
consolidation. Last year, it generated $3.3bn in net income from $20.5bn in revenue. 
AT&T and BellSouth declined to comment.

By Dionne Searcey, Amy Schatz, Almar Latour and Dennis Berman 
Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--AT&T Inc. (T) is nearing the acquisition of BellSouth Corp. (BLS) for roughly $65 
billion, people familiar with the situation said Saturday evening. A deal could be announced as early as Monday, 
these people said. 
AT&T is targeting at least $2 billion in cost savings in the BellSouth deal, said a person familiar with the matter 
Sunday. AT&T also plans to phase out the Cingular wireless brand name and use the AT&T name. 
AT&T will pay about $37 per share for BellSouth, representing about an 18 percent premium to BellSouth's 
share price Friday. The total equity value of the deal is at least $65 billion, plus the assumption of an additional 
$17 billion of BellSouth debt. 
Spokespeople for BellSouth and AT&T declined to comment. 
An AT&T-BellSouth deal would effectively cleave the nation's telecom services in two, each vertically integrated 
with a local phone operation, business services, and wireless unit. And it would effectively validate the vision of 
competition laid out by the government - one in which traditional telecom firms compete directly against cable 
operators rather than against each other. The move would give AT&T Inc. sole control over Cingular, the nation's 
largest wireless operator. 
A combination between AT&T and BellSouth could have combined market capitalization of nearly $160 billion, 
making AT&T far larger than rival Verizon. The deal would nonetheless set a showdown between AT&T and 
Verizon, as the two fight to control wireless, the growth portion of the telecom business. 
It was the steep growth of Cingular - joint owned by BellSouth and the former SBC - that helped push the two 
firms together, say telecom bankers familiar with the space. As the importance of the wireless business grew, 
they say, it became inevitable that SBC (which adopted the AT&T name just months ago) would consolidate its 
position in the South. Put together, the SBC territory would extend from California to Florida, north to Illinois and 
south to Texas. 
AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Edward Whitacre has made a name for himself in the telecommunications 
industry as a serial acquirer. 
Mr. Whitacre is able to boast of a string of acquisitions including Pacific Telesis Corp., Ameritech Corp. and 
Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. But as he nears retirement the market had been anticipating 
one last hurrah from him; a BellSouth acquisition by AT&T has long been the subject of speculation from 
analysts, investors and the two companies' rivals. 
Still the speedy move to acquire BellSouth came as a surprise so soon after Mr. Whitacre's takeover of AT&T 
Corp. last fall. His company is just starting to digest the $16 billion acquisition. The former SBC Communications 
Inc. took over AT&T Corp. and adopted the AT&T moniker. The new company dominates nearly every aspect of 
the industry, from high-speed Internet connections to long-distance phone service, as well as wireless. And Mr. 
Whitacre now has access to the old AT&T's enterprise business and world-wide network.

Page 113 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Such a deal would likely prompt howls of protest in some quarters as it comes on the heels not only of the 
AT&T-SBC deal but also after Verizon Communications Inc.'s acquisition of MCI. Those deals were approved with 
only a few minor conditions despite concerns they would lead to higher prices for business customers. 
The wave of mergers has dramatically reshaped the telecom industry, and a purchase of BellSouth would further 
cement the recreation of the old Ma Bell, which the government pushed to break up in 1984. 
The management of AT&T, which has apparently briefed key senior government officials late last week, appears 
to be betting that the Bush administration and a Bell-friendly Federal Communications Commission won't raise too 
many obstacles for such a deal, arguing that the companies serve different geographic regions and do not 
currently compete with one another in a significant way. 
Although AT&T and Verizon's last mergers passed both FCC and Justice Department review with little major 
problems, the latest proposed merger may face more hurdles. Recent comments by AT&T and BellSouth 
executives about their intentions to explore new revenue streams from their high-speed Internet services by 
introducing two-tier or "premium" service for Internet content providers. Concerns about those plans and the 
concept of "net neutrality," or ensuring that consumers have open access to all Internet sites and services and 
businesses do not find their content slowed, has become a major problems for the Bells in Washington. 
Meanwhile, the FCC that will be reviewing the AT&T/BellSouth deal will likely be a much different body soon with 
the addition of Robert McDowell, a veteran telecom lawyer who currently serves as assistant general counsel at 
Comptel, which represents smaller telephone companies and was a vocal opponent of the AT&T and Verizon 
mergers last year. 
Mr. McDowell is scheduled to appear before a Senate committee on Thursday for his confirmation and is likely to 
be asked about the merger. Although Mr. McDowell is a Republican, his nomination to the FCC was met with 
noticeable unease by the Bell companies, which have privately expressed some concern his experience working 
with smaller competitors may make him less than sympathetic to their concerns.

NEW YORK, March 5, 2006 (AFP) - 
US telecommunications giant AT and T Inc., and BellSouth Corporation announced a giant 67 billion dollar 
merger deal Sunday. 
The deal, if approved by US regulators and the companies' shareholders, would create the country's largest 
telecommunications group by market capitalization, overshadowing rival Verizon Communications. 
"This merger is a logical next step that creates substantial value for customers and stockholders of both AT and T 
and BellSouth," AT and T chairman and chief executive Edward Whitacre Jr., said in a statement. 
The companies said in a joint statement that Whitacre would become the chairman and CEO of the newly-merged 
company. 
The merger will also streamline the operations of Cingular Wireless, which is jointly owned by both companies. 
AT and T and BellSouth said that their tie-up would promote competition and that it would be good for employees 
and shareholders. 
Under the terms of the deal, which has been approved by both companies' boards, BellSouth shareholders will 
receive a 17.9 percent premium for their shares, based on BellSouth's closing share price on Friday, or around 
37.09 dollars per BellSouth common share. 
They will also receive 1.325 shares of AT and T common stock for each common share of BellSouth, pricing the 
deal at 67 billion dollars. 
The companies also said that consolidation of operations under the alliance would lead to savings of over two 
billion dollars by 2008, rising to three billion dollars by 2010. 
The statement said "additional savings are expected to come from combining staff functions and from reduced 
ongoing advertising and branding expenses". 
AT and T currently employs 189,000 staff while BellSouth has 63,000 employees. 
The deal would see the combined entity's market capitalization established around 150 billion dollars compared to 
Verizons's capitalization of some 93 billion dollars. 
BellSouth chairman and CEO Duane Ackerman will stay on during the transition period until the merger is 
completed. 
The newly-merged group will be headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, while Cingular's headquarters will remain 
in Atlanta, Georgia. 
The tie-up comes after AT and T's recent merger with SBC Communications. SBC clinched that 16-billion-dollar 
deal last year, but chose to adopt the storied American Telephone and Telegraph name for the newly merged 
company.

AT and T shares closed down 29 cents, 1.03 percent, at 27.99 dollars on Wall Street on Friday, while BellSouth 
closed lower 42 cents, or 1.32 percent, at 31.46 dollars.

WASHINGTON (XFN-ASIA) -- AT&T Inc., formerly known as SBC Communications, predicted Tuesday that 
per-share profit from operations, excluding onetime costs, would rise at a "double digit" pace over the next three 
years owing to bigger savings from the recent acquisition of the old Ma Bell. 
Executives of AT&T told financial analysts at an annual investors meeting in New York that "merger synergies" 
would rise to $3 billion on an annual basis by 2008 and ultimately reach as high as $18 billion. The company 
originally predicted $15 billion in total benefits. 
In Wall Street lingo, synergy refers to the perceived benefits generated when companies merge operations. 
In addition, AT&T said that other initiatives to cut costs would results in as much as $1.2 billion in annual savings 
by 2008. 
The higher savings should enable the acquired assets to add to AT&T's net earnings in 2007, a year ahead of the 
company's original forecast in January 2005, when SBC said it would purchase Ma Bell. 
Excluding merger costs, the old AT&T assets are also projected to boost the new company's profit by 30 cents a 
share in 2008. 
"We are confident that synergies from the AT&T merger will be larger, and that they will come sooner, than in the 
outlook we provided a year ago," Chief Executive Edward Whitacre Jr. said. "The AT&T merger is everything we 
hoped it would be and more." 
In Tuesday trades, AT&T stock, a component of the Dow industrials, set a 52-week high. 
The former SBC closed the $16 billion acquisition of the old Ma Bell on Nov. 18. SBC then adopted the AT&T 
name. SBC, historically a regional local phone company, made the deal to obtain AT&T's global network and 
valuable roster of large corporate clients. 
Executives hope they can use AT&T's massive long-distance network and powerful brand name to sign up more 
business customers. 
They also want to package local and long-distance calling plans with Cingular's wireless service to attract and 
maintain consumers. AT&T owns 60% of Cingular, with BellSouth Corp. owning the rest. 
At the analysts' meeting, AT&T executives also said they expect revenue to "turn positive in 2008." Revenue is 
expected to drop in the new two years owing to a long-term decline in the old Ma Bell's consumer long-distance 
business. 
By 2008, AT&T executives believe they will have largely stemmed the decline. At the same time, growth in the 
company's wireless and high-speed Internet operations are expected to generate sizable growth. 
In addition, AT&T said free cash flow - cash generated after dividends and capital expenses are paid - should 
climb from $2 billion in 2006 to $5 billion in 2008. 
During 2006, capital expenditures are projected to range from $8 billion to $8.5 billion. AT&T plans to buy back $2 
billion worth of company stock during the year.

Page 120 of 124 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Last month, AT&T issued its first quarter of results since the acquisition. The company posted sharply higher 
profit in the fourth-quarter, as the company generated strong growth in its wireless and high-speed DSL Internet 
services. 
In the final three months of 2005, the company said net income totaled $1. 66 billion, or 46 cents a share. 
Revenue rose 25% to $21.5 billion. Those figures include a partial contribution from the old AT&T Corp.

(Adds comment from AT&T executive in paragraphs 5-6) 
PHILADELPHIA, Jan 5 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. may be weighing a $13 billion bet to expand its television services 
and stymie competition from cable operators with a potential purchase of EchoStar Communications Corp. , 
analysts said on Thursday. 
Industry rumors resurfaced this week at the Consumer Electronics Show, an industry trade show in Las Vegas, 
that AT&T may buy EchoStar outright rather than merely reselling the satellite television company's service, 
analysts said. 
"If AT&T acquires EchoStar they could continue to offer satellite television to their customers, plus they'd own a 
provider of services to the rest of the Baby Bells (local telephone companies)," said independent 
telecommunications analyst Jeffrey Kagan. 
"This could be a growth opportunity for AT&T with a quicker payoff," Kagan said. 
AT&T Chief Operating Officer Randall Stephenson declined to comment on speculation of a potential bid for 
EchoStar, but noted that the two companies already have a successful partnership. 
"You can work together. You don't have to own one. We're proving it today," Stephenson told Reuters at an 
interview on Thursday at the CES trade show. 
EchoStar, which has a market capitalization of about $12.9 billion, could not be immediately reached for 
comment. The new AT&T, created by the recent purchase of AT&T Inc. by SBC Communications Inc., has a 
market capitalization of $97.3 billion. 
Shares of EchoStar have risen 8.7 percent since Dec. 15, a rise Janco Partners Inc. analyst Matthew Harrigan 
attributed to stock-market chatter that a potential deal with AT&T could emerge. Still, EchoStar is down 15.1 
percent from its 52-week high of $33.52 in January 2005. 
On Wednesday, EchoStar said it had 12 million customers as of late December. Analysts attributed that 
subscriber growth, in part, to SBC strengthening its efforts to market the companies' co-branded satellite TV 
service. 
Kagan said EchoStar would give AT&T a quick fix while it still pursued other efforts to offer video services to 
customers. Through its DISH Network, EchoStar provides more than 500 channels, including sports, audio, 
entertainment and international programming. 
"I think an acquisition of a satellite TV provider would fit an immediate need, and they would continue to invest in 
their networks to offer network-based services," Kagan said. 
Yet Harrigan said buying Echostar would run counter to the long-term strategy of phone companies to offer voice, 
data and video services over one network. 
Buying EchoStar would leave video "in an entirely independent silo," rather than combining services on one 
network, Harrigan said. 
Edward Whitacre, chairman and chief executive of the new AT&T, had considered buying a different satellite 
television operator while at the helm of SBC.

In 2003, SBC was among several bidders for DirecTV Group Inc. , but walked away due to the complicated 
structure of the deal. 
AT&T could offer as much as $33 a share to $35 a share in cash and stock for EchoStar without harming its 
investment-grade credit rating, said telecommunications investment bankers. 
AT&T President David Dorman said last month that he expected the AT&T would be hungry for more deals. He 
also said he saw room for consolidation in the wireless industry and the media business. 
AT&T also has been seen as a potential buyer of local telephone company BellSouth Corp. , according to 
telecommunications investment bankers and analysts. 
Shares of EchoStar closed at $28.50, down 12 cents, on Nasdaq. Shares of AT&T gained 6 cents to close at 
$24.95 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by Sinead Carew in Las Vegas)
