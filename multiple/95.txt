In Hopkinton, Mass., story headlined "EMC says Data General buy to cut Q4 earns slightly", in paragraph 
beginning "Data Storage giant..." please read "...a couple of pennies per share..." instead of "...a few pennies..." 
HOPKINTON, Mass., Oct 28 (Reuters) - Data storage giant EMC Corp. said its recently completed acquisition of 
Data General will lop a couple of pennies per share from fourth-quarter earnings, but add to earnings by a few 
cents in 2000, President and Chief Executive Michael Ruettgers said on Thursday. 
On Oct. 12, EMC completed its $1.1 billion purchase of Data General Corp., of Westborough, Mass. On Oct. 20, 
EMC reported earnings for its third quarter ended Sept. 30 of $309.5 million, or 29 cents per diluted share, on 
revenue of $1.33 billion. 
Data General operating losses will shave a few pennies from EMC earnings in the fourth quarter, EMC said. 
EMC also plans a charge "in excess of $100 million" in the fourth quarter related to transaction costs, job cuts and 
other factors, Ruettgers said. 
Analysts have forecast fourth-quarter earnings for EMC of 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson 
Financial. 
Ruettgers, speaking to reporters after a briefing with securities analysts, said combined, the companies would 
have earned $296 million, or 27 cents a share, on $1.7 billion in revenue for the third quarter. 
EMC is on a calendar fiscal year, while Data General's year ended at the end of September. For its full year, 
Data General had sales of about $1.4 billion, in line with its year-earlier revenues, Ruettgers said. 
Ruettgers made the specific Data General financial information available after analysts complained last week 
when EMC released earnings and declined to give guidance on how Data General would affect EMC results 
going forward. 
During the fourth quarter, the Data General deal will bring EMC $100 million in sales of CLARiiON storage 
systems and $200 million in sales of AViiON servers, Ruettgers said. 
EMC plans to refocus Data General's AViiON server business in 2000, cutting revenues by 25 percent to 30 
percent from this year's roughly $1 billion run rate. Ruettgers said the server business will be profitable next year. 
Ruettgers said EMC, which was not in the server business before acquiring Data General, has "no plans to 
jettison" the server business. 
CLARiiON, meanwhile, will add $600 million in sales to EMC's top line in 2000, Ruettgers said. He said the 
CLARiiON line has a revenue potential of $1 billion. 
All told, Ruettgers said he expects the company to achieve a revenue growth rate in 2000 on a percentage basis 
in "the mid-20s." 
The deal, Ruettgers said, boosts EMC's market opportunity in the high-end data storage industry to $50 billion 
from roughly $35 billion and speeds EMC's growth rate. 
"We continue to feel very, very good about this acquisition," he said.

Ruettgers reiterated EMC's goal to grow "organic" revenues to $10 billion in 2001, from $3.9 billion in 1998. With 
Data General, he said, the revenue target for 2001 should be $12 billion. 
On Thursday, EMC stock rose 3 to 70-7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.

EMC, the leading data storage business, is buying Data General, the computing group, for about $1bn in stock, 
targeting the market for mid-range data storage products. 
The move comes as competition in the data storage market is intensifying. EMC is estimated to have about 70 
per cent of the market for open systems data storage products, but it is being challenged by International 
Business Machines. 
IBM announced recently it was launching competitively priced products and last month it bought Mylex, a maker 
of high-performance computer storage hardware and software. 
Demand for data storage products has risen dramatically with the growth of the internet and e-commerce. 
Online sales allow business to collect huge amounts of data about customers and sales patterns, creating a new 
market for technology capable of storing and analysing it. 
EMC has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of this new market, helping its share price to rise six-fold over the 
past two years. 
Michael Ruettgers, EMC chief executive officer, said Data General was particularly strong in the mid-range 
storage market but lacked the distribution capability to take full advantage of its potential. 
Barry Jaruzelski, a partner with Booz, Allen and Hamilton, said the deal was a defensive move by EMC to the 
threat of greater competition from IBM. 
"EMC is really trying to fill out its product line. It gets very juicy margins at the top end, but IBM is going after this 
market and it looks like there is a war brewing. Data General gives EMC a little more market breadth." 
Data General has been in long-term decline, but in its heyday it was a leading manufacturer of minicomputers 
and was famously celebrated in Tracy Kidder's Pulitzer prize-winning book, The Soul of a New Machine. 
However, the company had seemed to be halting a decline in revenues and had started to reduce its losses. In its 
last quarter it had sales of $355.9m, up from $351.3m a year ago, and over the same period its losses narrowed 
from $155m to $3.1m. 
EMC is paying 0.3262 shares in EMC for each Data General share, an offer worth $1.1bn based on EMC's stock 
price of $60 before the deal was announced. 
Data General's shares leapt 32 per cent yesterday to $17 7/16 on news of EMC's offer, representing a 40 per 
cent premium to Data General's pre-bid value. 
EMC's stock was down 7 per cent to $55 3/4, but analysts said the offer was a fair price at one times sales.

EMC Corp, regarded as the market leader in data storage systems, has agreed to buy Data General Corp, a top 
maker of mid-range computer data storage products, for $1.1bn in stock, the companies said on Monday. 
The acquisition enables EMC to tap the mid-range storage market, which typically serves systems priced from 
$100,000 to $1m, and to cater to all online storage needs of its customers. 
Data General's CLARiiON storage products are recognised as among the most advanced in the world, and its 
research and development could find uses in EMC's existing products, the companies said. 
EMC chief executive Michael Ruettgers said, "Data General's products have proven technology leadership in 
the mid-range storage market, particularly in the Windows NT and UNIX environments, but have lacked the global 
distribution and support needed to achieve their full market potential. "We believe they will provide an excellent 
complement to our high-end Symmetrix Enterprise Storage family and will enable us to serve this growing 
market." 
Data Storage holds four per cent of the total $10bn data storage market. It had about $356m in revenues in the 
third quarter ended June 26, 1999. 
EMC will issue 0.3262 share of common stock for each share of Data General. The deal values Data General at 
about $19.58 a share, based on EMC's August 6 closing stock price, the companies said. 
Data General shares closed at $13.19 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. EMC finished at $60.06. 
EMC said it expects the deal, which requires approval by regulators and Data General shareholders, to boost its 
fiscal 2000 and 2001 earnings. 
The deal could close before the end of 1999 and will be accounted for as pooling of interests, the companies said. 
The merger pact comes one week after International Business Machines Corp agreed to buy Mylex Corp, a 
maker of controllers and adapters used in data storage systems, for $240m. EMC is regarded as the market 
leader in this business.

WALTHAM, Mass., Aug 9 (Reuters) - High-end data storage leader EMC Corp. on Monday moved to grab a 
chunk of the mid-range storage business with a deal to buy Data General Corp. for $1.1 billion in stock, the 
companies said. 
EMC, which holds a 35 percent share of the $12 billion high-end storage market, said it will lend its considerable 
distribution and support muscle to leverage Data General's CLARiiON line of mid-range storage systems. 
"It's rare in a business career when you can do a single transaction that allows you to significantly enlarge the 
market opportunities you have and yet not move away from your core competency," EMC Chief Executive 
Michael Ruettgers said. 
EMC expects the size of its high-end storage marketplace to increase to $35 billion in 2001. By entering Data 
General's mid-range market, EMC expects it would add another $14 billion in market opportunity in 2001. 
In the fast-growing data storage business, Ruettgers said demand for information storage doubles each year from 
the world's 2,000 largest companies. 
EMC last week reiterated its plan to grow revenues to $10 billion in 2001, from $3.9 billion in 1998. Ruettgers said 
the $10 billion target had been from organic growth and the Data General acquisition would increase the figure, 
but he declined to say by how much. 
The deal is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2000 and "significantly" accretive in 2001, Ruettgers said. 
EMC shares fell $4-1/16 to $56 in mid-afternoon trading. Analysts attributed the drop to the deal's 
unexpectedness and concern that it would distract EMC from its legendary customer focus. 
Data General's CLARiiON storage products are recognised as technologically advanced, and its research and 
development capabilities could be useful for EMC's existing products, the companies said. 
"It extends (EMC's) reach," said analyst John Rosenthal of Burnham Securities. 
Analyst Michael Geran of Pershing/Division of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette agreed that the deal "makes strategic 
sense." 
Geran said Data General faced the daunting expense of building its sales force to support its product line, and 
said Data General's storage business would nicely complement EMC's. 
For its third quarter ended June 26, Data General posted a loss of $3.1 million, or six cents a share, on revenues 
of $355.9 million. In May, Data General said it would hire 450 people over the next 18 months, most of them to 
support CLARiiON customers, at a cost of more than $100 million. 
"This will give them (EMC) a platform to sell into smaller capacity accounts," said analyst Thomas Mancino of 
Pacific Growth Equities. The deal also eliminates a competitor that EMC ran up against at its lower margins, 
Mancino said. 
The close geographic proximity of the two companies would also be a plus in integrating the firms, Geran noted. 
EMC is based in Hopkinton, Mass., while Data General is in nearby Westboro, Mass.

EMC has 12,000 employees and Data General has 5,000. Ruettgers said there will be "some mismatches of 
talent," but noted EMC has 1,500 job vacancies worldwide. 
Analysts said Data General's AViiON server business is a question mark. EMC said it would operate the server 
line as a separate unit and has no plans to spin it off. If it wanted to sell the server business, EMC would have to 
wait two years to do so under the deal's structure. 
EMC would issue 0.3262 share of common stock for each share of Data General. The deal values Data General 
at about $19.58 a share, based on EMC's Aug. 6 closing stock price, the companies said. 
Data General shares closed at 13-3/16 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. EMC finished then at 
60-1/16. 
The deal, expected to close before year's end, requires approval by regulators and Data General shareholders. 
The deal comes one week after International Business Machines Corp. agreed to buy Mylex Corp., a maker of 
controllers and adapters used in data storage systems, for $240 million. EMC is regarded as the market leader in 
this business.

HOPKINTON, Mass. -(Dow Jones)- EMC Corp. Monday said it has agreed to acquire Data General Corp. in a 
stock swap with an indicated value of $933.4 milllion. The deal would create a powerhouse in the computer 
industry's booming storage sector. 
Under the terms of the agreement, EMC (EMC) will issue 0.3262 of a common share for each common share of 
Data General (DGN), subject to certain adjustments. Based on EMC's closing stock price Monday of $57, the 
transaction values Data General at $18.59 a share. Data General, based in Westboro, Mass., had some 50.2 
million shares outstanding when it reported third-quarter earnings in July. 
When announced, the deal was valued at about $1.1 billion, or $19.58 per Data General share, based on EMC's 
Friday closing price of $60. The price represented a 48% premium to Data General's Friday closing price of 
$13.19. 
Wall Street on Monday applauded the deal, sending Data General's shares soaring $4.25, or 32%, to close at 
$17.438, on volume of 9.52 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 850,000. EMC shares sagged 
$3, or 5%, to end at $57, on volume of 10.8 million, compared with average volume of 5.7 million. 
EMC makes enterprise-storage systems and software for mainframe computers and open systems, while Data 
General provides servers, storage systems and related software. 
The deal would marry the companies' storage operations and leave Data General's Aviion server business to 
operate as a separate unit. 
"We have been successful in the high-end enterprise storage market for a number of years," said Gil Press, 
director of corporate information for EMC, but the Data General merger will allow the company to tap into the 
mid-range computer storage market through Data General's product line, he said. 
"It's a sizable market - $10 billion in 1998 - and it's growing fast, so we decided to seize the opportunity," Press 
said. 
Data General developed the Clariion fibre-channel disk-storage system - a line equipped with high-speed, 
fiber-optic connections - but has depended on resellers like Dell Computer Corp. (DELL) and Unisys Corp. (UIS) 
to market the system. Fibre channel is a next-generation technology which lets corporations with far-flung 
operations store data more easily and retrieve it faster than the current standard. 
In May, the company said it would establish a 450-member sales force to market the system directly to 
companies and governments. Analysts saw the direct-sales push as a risky gamble, particularly because Data 
General would be competing head-to-head with EMC, which is known for having one of the computer industry's 
strongest sales organizations. 
Data General's Clariion mid-range data storage products have "a very good reputation and brand name," Press 
said, but Data General "didn't have the sales muscle behind it," that EMC can muster. 
In a conference call Monday afternoon, EMC chief executive Michael Ruettgers said the acquisition will allow 
EMC to increase its target market by 40% to close to $50 billion next year. 
Ruettgers said the market for EMC's products was $12 billion last year and expected to grow to $35 billion by 
2000, but the projected share of market place growth after the merger will help push that toward $50 billion by 
2000. Last year, EMC reported revenue of about $4 billion, while Data General reported $1.5 billion.

The booming demand for information technology products among the world's leading companies, especially from 
the "dot.com companies" is resulting in a doubling of projected industry revenue year-to-year, and data storage 
products are a part of that, Ruettgers said. 
Internet Web sites, for example, are collecting more information about their users, such as tracking their 
preferences to develop a user profile, and "using it to a competitive advantage," he said. They are also using it to 
enhance customers' time spent at the site. That sort of technique relies on reliable and capacious data storage, 
Ruettgers said. 
EMC said it would account for the transaction as a pooling of interests for accounting purposes and a tax-free 
exchange of shares under Internal Revenue Service regulations. 
In a pooling, merging companies combine their balance sheets and avoid future earnings charges for goodwill, 
the premium acquiring companies pay over book value. 
EMC hopes to close the deal, which is subject to approval by Data General stockholders and regulators, before 
the end of the year. The acquisition will add to the company's earnings in 2000 and add "significantly" to earnings 
in 2001. 
Press said no decision has been made on potential management or work-force structure changes. EMC employs 
11,200 people world-wide, including 4,600 in Massachusetts. Data General has a work force of about 5,000, 
including 1,800 in Massachusetts.
