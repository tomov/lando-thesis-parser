2003 MAY 16 - (NewsRx.com & NewsRx.net) -- Johnson & Johnson announced sales for the first quarter of $9.8 
billion, an increase of 12.3% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, worldwide sales increased 
8.1%. Domestic sales were up 8.9%, while international sales increased 6.9% on an operational basis. 
Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $2.1 billion and $.69, increases of 12.9% and 
16.9%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2002. These amounts include after-tax special charges of 
$15 million taken in the first quarter of 2003 for in-process research and development costs associated with the 
acquisitions of 3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Orquest, Inc., 
"I am pleased with our ability to continue to deliver solid results in sales and earnings despite the challenges of 
intense competition," said William C. Weldon, chairman and CEO. "The breadth of our businesses in human 
healthcare serves us well, an excellent example this quarter being the strong performance of our worldwide 
consumer businesses." Weldon also stated, "The key to our long-term consistent performance is our ongoing 
investment in science and technology." 
Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $4.7 billion for the first quarter of 2003 represented an increase of 11.6% 
versus the prior year on a reported basis and 7.8% operationally. Domestic sales increased 10.3%, while 
international sales increased 14.7%. Sales growth reflects the strong performance of Remicade, a treatment for 
rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn disease; Duragesic, a transdermal patch for chronic pain; Topamax, an 
antiepileptic; Aciphex/Pariet, a proton pump inhibitor for gastrointestinal disorders, and Risperdal, an 
antipsychotic medication. Procrit/Eprex, a product for the treatment of anemia, was impacted by increased 
competition and had minimal reported growth. 
During the first quarter, the company announced a definitive agreement to acquire Scios, Inc., a 
biopharmaceutical company with a marketed product for cardiovascular disease and research projects focused 
on auto-immune diseases. Scios' product Natrecor is a novel agent approved for congestive heart failure and has 
several significant advantages over existing therapies. Their research and development program includes several 
potential new treatments for pain and inflammatory diseases, including an advanced p-38 kinase inhibitor 
program. The transaction is valued at approximately $2.4 billion, net of cash, and was expected to close in late 
April. 
Also in the quarter, the company announced and completed the acquisition of 3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc., a company with a technology platform focused on the discovery and development of potential new drugs in 
early stage development for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, oncology and inflammation. The 
transaction is valued at $88 million, net of cash. 
The company also received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Remicade (infliximab) for the 
additional indication of long-term treatment of fistulizing Crohn disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder 
that commonly affects the lower part of the small and large intestine, as well as Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine HCl) 5 
mg tablets for the treatment of muscle spasm associated with painful musculoskeletal conditions. In April, the 
company received FDA approval for Risperdal M-Tab (risperidone), a fast dissolving form of the schizophrenia 
medication that dissolves in seconds when placed in the mouth. 
Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics achieved sales of $3.4 billion in the first quarter of 2003, which 
represented an increase over the prior year of 13.7% on a reported basis and 8.0% operationally. Domestic and 
international sales increased 5.1% and 24.8%, respectively. DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal 
products, and Ethicon Endo-Surgery's minimally invasive surgical products achieved very strong sales growth. 
Also contributing to the overall performance of the segment were solid results from Cordis' circulatory disease 
management products and Ethicon's wound care and women's health products.

During the quarter, the company completed the acquisition of Orquest, Inc., a privately held biotechnology 
company focused on developing biologically-based implants for orthopaedics and spine surgery. Orquest's 
principal product, Healos Bone Graft Material, is designed to reduce the time and pain associated with standard 
bone graft harvesting and represents a therapeutic advance for patients requiring bone graft material for spine 
fusion or other surgery. 
Worldwide Consumer sales were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2003, an increase of 11.7% over the prior year 
on a reported basis and 9.6% operationally. Domestic sales increased 11.1%, while international sales increased 
12.4%.
