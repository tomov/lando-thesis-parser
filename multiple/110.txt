In August, the web search giant agreed to buy the mobile handset manufacturer at a 63pc premium to its share 
price in an effort to mount a challenge to Apple as a technology manufacturer. 
Larry Page, Google's chief executive, said at the time that it would "supercharge" Google's Android operating 
system and help extend it into areas other than smartphones. 
Crucially, it would give the company access to Motorola's 17,000 patents and 7,500 pending patents, helping it to 
defend the third-party mobile phone manufacturers that use its Android operating system from intellectual 
property legal claims. 
However, the acquisition would put Google in direct competition with customers which use its operating system, 
such as HTC, LG and Huawei, sparking concerns that it could abuse its dominant position.

EARNINGS PREVIEW: US Internet Companies In A Mixed Bag For 3Q 
EARNINGS PREVIEW: US Internet Companies In A Mixed Bag For 3Q

TAKING THE PULSE: While the fortunes of Internet companies reliant on search like Google Inc. (GOOG) and 
Yahoo Inc. (YHOO) appear to diverge more with every quarter, retailers like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and eBay 
Inc. (EBAY) have taken on increasingly similar trajectories. 
That's largely based on the turnaround efforts of the underdogs in both categories: Yahoo in search and eBay in 
retailing. Yahoo's plan has failed to show convincing momentum, but eBay's attempt to revive its marketplace 
segment has been paying off. The heavyweights, Google for search and Amazon for retailing, have been 
improving steadily, though both have been marked by significant spending strategies that have weighed on profit 
sometimes. 
COMPANIES TO WATCH: 
Google Inc. (GOOG) - reports Oct. 13 
Wall Street Expectations: Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect third-quarter earnings of $8.74 a share 
on revenue of $7.19 billion. A year earlier, the company reported $6.72 a share, or $7.64 excluding stock 
compensation costs, on revenue of $5.48 billion after deducting traffic-acquisition costs. Total revenue was $7.29 
billion. 
Key Issues: Since the Internet search leader's last report, it agreed to its largest acquisition ever, Motorola 
Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) for $12.5 billion, and faced its broadest antitrust scrutiny yet from U.S. officials. 
Operationally, Google's earnings have kept marching higher. Search ad revenue continues as the driving force, 
and cost increases seemed to abate in the second quarter. On the last call, Chief Executive Larry Page focused 
his comments on nonsearch ventures like Google+, but while he said Google is "only at 1% of what is possible," 
he soothed investor nerves about spending, saying the company would balance short-term and long-term results. 
Yahoo Inc. (YHOO) - reports Oct. 18 
Wall Street Expectations: Analysts predict third-quarter earnings of 17 cents a share on revenue of $1.07 billion, 
according to Thomson Reuters. A year earlier, the company reported a 29-cent per-share profit on revenue of 
$1.12 billion after traffic-acquisition costs. Total revenue was $1.6 billion. 
Key Issues: Yahoo's turnaround plan to pare down its wide-ranging operations and join forces with Microsoft Corp. 
(MSFT) in search has yet to reliably grow revenue. In the second quarter, earnings rose 11% as costs for 
development, sales and marketing declined but revenue also fell. While display advertising rose, unadjusted 
search advertising revenue declined 45%. The plodding turnaround effort culminated with the unceremonious 
ouster of Chief Executive Carol Bartz in September. Chief Financial Officer Tim Morse stepped into the CEO role 
on an interim basis, but the company is more focused on pursuing a sale of part or all of itself than on finding a 
permanent CEO, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 
eBay Inc. (EBAY) - reports Oct. 19

Page 5 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Wall Street Expectations: Analysts anticipate third-quarter earnings of 48 cents a share on revenue of $2.91 
billion. A year earlier, the company posted earnings of 40 cents a share, excluding stock compensation and 
charges--unadjusted, earnings per share were 33 cents--on revenue of $2.25 billion. 
Key Issues: The marketplace segment, the company's largest division, has started to reap the benefits of 
technology and fee changes made last year as part of eBay's turnaround effort. In the second quarter, 
marketplace revenue increased 19% and a climb in gross merchandise volume marked a full year of quarterly 
increases. The unit had lagged the wider online retailing industry, while eBay's online payments unit, which 
includes PayPal, has thrived. Chief Executive John Donahoe said on the last call that eBay has begun to 
capitalize on a blurring of online and offline commerce through its mobile shopping apps and the PayPal 
payments unit. 
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) - expected Oct. 20 
Wall Street Expectations: On average, analysts predict third-quarter earnings of 24 cents a share on revenue of 
$10.93 billion, versus last year's 51 cents and $7.56 billion, respectively. 
Key Issues: The online retailing leader has been investing aggressively in distribution and digital offerings at the 
expense of the bottom line in recent quarters, with profit in the second quarter dropping 7.7% even as net sales 
surged 51%. Last month, Amazon unveiled its Kindle Fire, a tablet designed to challenge the market-leading iPad 
from Apple Inc. (AAPL). The Kindle Fire is priced much lower than the cheapest iPad but lacks a number of 
iPad-like features; it has no camera nor microphone and limited internal storage, banking instead on cloud 
storage through the device's Wi-Fi connection. Leading up to the Kindle Fire launch, Amazon has also been 
testing a redesign of its website that makes tablet-based shopping easier and has been beefing up its streaming 
content offerings. 
(The Thomson Reuters estimates and year-earlier earnings may not be comparable due to one-time items and 
other adjustments.)

By John Letzing 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones)--Google Inc.'s (GOOG) plan to spend $12.5 billion on an Illinois-based hardware 
maker with a starkly different business model and far smaller profit margins has some observers scratching their 
heads. 
Google, like other Internet firms that rely on online advertising for revenue, has been able to remain highly 
profitable even as it presses ahead with sweeping expansion in terms of both employees and new services. 
Google has said buying Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) will give it tens of thousands of important patents, 
while "supercharging" its Android mobile software. Motorola Mobility will be run as an independent business, 
Google has said. 
But some observers can't quite grasp how Google would keep Motorola Mobility's hardware business, without 
seriously weighing down its enviable financial model. 
Google, Mountain View, Calif., stunned the technology world with its Aug. 15 announcement that it would buy 
Motorola Mobility, heir to an 83-year-old electronics concern based in a suburb roughly an hour's drive north of 
central Chicago. 
The move is a bold one for a Silicon Valley giant that has grown up on a steady diet of online ad revenue, and a 
seemingly odd step for a company with margins constantly under Wall Street's watchful gaze. 
During a conference call held to announce the purchase, Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette stressed 
that the deal doesn't affect Google's margins "in any way," as Motorola Mobility will be a separately run 
business. 
Google has appointed longtime executive Dennis Woodside to oversee integration of Motorola Mobility. Google 
declined to make Woodside available to comment. 
Google's $40-per-share bid for Motorola Mobility represents a roughly 63% premium to Motorola Mobility's 
share price on the eve of the acquisition announcement. In a regulatory filing made roughly a month after it was 
announced, Motorola Mobility disclosed that the deal was reached after a swift set of negotiations with a single 
bidder. 
According to data from FactSet Research, Google's net margin is expected to be 36.1% this year, compared with 
0.6% for Motorola Mobility. That means Google would keep about 36 cents of every dollar it earns after 
expenses, while Motorola Mobility would pocket less than a penny.

The U.S. Justice Department currently has the planned merger under antitrust review. 
Ben Schachter, an analyst covering Google for Macquarie Securities, initially believed Google would spin off 
Motorola Mobility's hardware business after the deal closes. He reasoned that while operating Motorola 
Mobility as an independent unit would mean reporting separate margin numbers, Motorola's hardware would still 
present too much of a financial drag. 
"No one really believes them," Schachter said of Google's stance that it would keep the hardware lines, shortly 
after the merger was announced. 
But Schachter has since changed his mind. The deciding factor: tablets. 
The analyst acknowledged that "probably 80 percent of investors" still believe Google will spin the hardware lines 
off. But after spending some time with company executives, Schachter thinks Google Chief Executive Larry Page 
"was concerned that the iPad would sort of own the category" of tablet devices if Motorola Mobility was left on 
its own to develop tablets based on Google's Android software. As a result, Schachter said he now thinks Google 
will retain the Motorola Mobility hardware lines. 
Apple Inc. (AAPL) has sold about 29 million of its iPad devices since it was unveiled at the beginning of last year. 
Motorola's tablet effort, the Xoom, so far has failed to win a wide audience. 
Investors are unlikely to place too much emphasis on Google's consolidated margin with Motorola Mobility, and 
will instead see the companies' margins as distinct, Schachter said. 
But Scott Kessler, an equity analyst who covers Google for Standard & Poor's, said investors will inevitably see 
Google in a different light after the acquisition closes. 
"We can't understand how people don't see how this injects a tremendous amount of uncertainty and risk to 
Google," Kessler said. 
In a statement published within Google's original papers filed for its 2004 initial public offering of shares, 
co-founders Page and Sergey Brin cautioned, "If opportunities arise that might cause us to sacrifice short term 
results but are in the best long term interest of our shareholders, we will take those opportunities." Page assumed 
the role of chief executive at Google in April. 
"That's great that they laid that out there, and they're adhering to it, but that's not necessarily what we're focused 
on," Kessler said, adding that investors now might prefer instead that Google work to maintain its financial 
standing. 
To be sure, Apple has been able to develop an integrated line of software and hardware, which includes the 
popular iPhone and iPad, while still retaining impressive margins. 
But Al Hilwa, an analyst with IDC, suggested that Apple is only capable of maintaining high margins thanks to an 
"absurdly narrow" range of hardware, which the Cupertino, Calif., company is able to produce cheaply and sell at 
high costs. 
"There is nothing in the Motorola [Mobility] acquisition that brings these Apple advantages," Hilwa said of 
Google's planned purchase. 
"Motorola will continue to make many phones that it will sell in a very diverse and fragmented Android market, 
where no single device will justify the design," he said.

Transformations of technology companies are fueling multibillion-dollar mergers and acquisitions and divestitures, 
as the industry consolidates and develops new businesses to compete for corporate IT budgets. 
Google's $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility, an Android operating system partner with a passel of 
patents, and Hewlett-Packard's decision to acquire UK software maker Autonomy for $10.3 billion - and to get out 
of the personal computer business - are the latest examples of the change in products and services that are 
reshaping the industry. 
The trend was evident in the first half of 2011, when M&A activity in the global technology sector nearly doubled 
from a year earlier. Among the notable deals were Texas Instruments' purchase of rival chipmaker National 
Semiconductor, Oracle's purchase of Sun Microsystems and SAP's acquisition of Sybase. 
Getting Out of PCs 
Palo Alto, California's HP, the world's largest maker of personal computers, is preparing to spin off the PC 
business, which accounts for a third of its revenue, and is paying a 79% premium for Autonomy. Leo Apotheker, 
who became CEO and president of HP in September 2010, says the $11.7 billion acquisition will allow the 
company to skip a generation of technology and help business clients track and understand their unstructured 
data. 
There is increasing momentum behind global technology M&A transactions heading into the second half of 2011, 
says Joe Steger, leader of global technology transaction advisory services at Ernst & Young. "Technology 
companies continue to stockpile cash, which gives them the flexibility to act when strategic M&A opportunities 
arise," Steger says. 
Cross-border deal volume in the second quarter of 2011 was up 32% from the same quarter a year earlier, and 
accounted for 46% of the aggregate value of global technology deals, he says, Increasing globalization and the 
growing volume of overseas cash accumulated by US companies may be behind the increase in cross border 
deals, Ernst & Young says. The US accounted for 56% of cross-border technology acquisitions in the second 
quarter. 
Microsoft used its overseas cash holdings to pay for its $8.5 billion acquisition of Luxembourg 
internet-phone-service provider Skype. 
Disruptive Innovation 
The rise in second-quarter technology mergers was driven by industry consolidation and ongoing disruptive 
innovation in areas such as cloud computing, smart mobility, Internet and mobile video, as well as the smart grid 
for electrical power distribution and solar energy, Steger says. 
"Importantly, even though 61% of all disclosed deal value was concentrated in the top 10 deals, we also saw 
significant dealmaking strength at the opposite end of the spectrum, in deals of less than SlOO million," Steger 
says. Cloud computing and software -as-a-service deals were pervasive, he notes. 
Google's acquisition ol Motorola Mobility and its 17,000 patents will enable the Mountain View, California search 
and online advertising company to better protect Android from anticompetitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and 
other companies, according to Larry Page, Google's cofounder and CEO.

Google's Biggest Deal 
Google paid a 63% premium for Libertyville, Minois's Motorola Mobility, not only for its strength in Android 
smartphones and devices but also because it is a market leader in in-thehome devices and video solutions, Page 
says. The cash deal was Google's largest acquisition ever. 
Android has become the world's most widely used smartphone operating system. Google licenses the system to 
device makers, including Motorola Mobility, Samsung Electronics, LG, Sony Ericsson and Acer.

Documents reveal Motorola Mobility convinced Google to raise takeover bid by $3 billion 
Documents reveal Motorola Mobility convinced Google to raise takeover bid by $3 billion

SAN FRANCISCO _ Google prized Motorola Mobility's patent portfolio so much that it threw in an extra $3 billion 
to get its takeover offer accepted last month. 
That tidbit emerged Tuesday in Securities and Exchange Commission documents that shed light on the 
negotiations that culminated in cellphone and tablet maker Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. agreeing to be sold to 
Google Inc. for $12.5 billion, or $40 per share. That's 33 per cent more than Google initially offered, according to 
the SEC filing. 
The proposed acquisition still requires approval from antitrust regulators. If the deal falls through, Google will still 
have to pay Motorola Mobility $2.5 billion. 
Google is digging deeper into its pockets than at any point in its 13-year history to protect its Android software 
from an onslaught of lawsuits alleging the technology for mobile devices infringes on other patents. Motorola 
Mobility offers some legal insulation because it already owns 17,500 mobile patents and has submitted another 
7,500 for approval. 
The discussions between the two companies began in early July, a few weeks after a group that included Google 
rivals Apple Inc. and Microsoft Crop. paid $4.5 billion for 6,000 patents owned by Nortel Networks. 
Andy Rubin, who oversees Google's mobile operations, made the first contact with Motorola Mobility CEO 
Sanjay Jha, in early July according to the documents. Later, Google CEO Larry Page and Nikesh Ahora, the 
company's chief business officer, entered the talks. 
After nearly a month of confidential discussions, Google offered $30 per share in an Aug. 1 letter to Motorola 
Mobility's board. At the time, Motorola Mobility's stock was hovering around $22 per share. 
Motorola Mobility rejected the first bid and asked for $43.50 per share on the advice of Silicon Valley investment 
banker Frank Quattrone of Qatalyst Partners. 
Google then suggested a price of $37 per share before finally agreeing to pay $40 per share on Aug. 9. 
The final $12.5 billion price tag exceeds the combined total that Google had paid for the 136 previous acquisitions 
that it has completed since going public in 2004. Those earlier deals cost Google a combined $9.1 billion. 
Buying Motorola Mobility is considered to be risky because it will thrust Google into the business of 
manufacturing hardware for the first time and threatens to alienate other device makers who have helped promote 
the free Android software. If the deal goes through, it will also test Google's ability to avoid culture clashes as it 
absorbs Motorola Mobility's 19,000 employees into its workforce.

It took less than seven weeks, but it became more expensive quickly. 
From the first discussions in early July to a formal announcement on Aug. 15, Google moved swiftly this summer 
to secure a $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility, according to a filing submitted on Tuesday. The search 
giant, which was eager to own Motorola's extensive patent portfolio, was also willing to pay up. 
After floating an initial bid of $30 a share on Aug. 1, Google raised its offer price to $37, before settling at $40 a 
share. In just weeks, the offer increased by more than $3 billion. 
For that, Motorola can thank Frank P. Quattrone, whose investment bank was hired on Aug. 1. 
The filing, which maps out the background of the merger, discloses how the deal came together in the wake of 
Google's failed bid for Nortel's patent portfolio. In early July -- mere days after Google lost out to a consortium led 
by Apple and Microsoft -- Andrew Rubin, the company's senior vice president of mobile, reached out to Sanjay 
Jha, the chief executive of Motorola Mobility, to discuss "the possible impact of and potential responses" to the 
Nortel purchase. Over the next several days, discussions intensified, roping in more executives, including 
Google's chief, Larry Page, and Nikesh Aurora, the company's chief business officer. And by mid-July, the 
parties had agreed to a confidentiality agreement, as Google began due diligence on Motorola Mobility's patent 
portfolio. 
Although talks initially centered on Motorola's patents, the focus quickly shifted to takeover talks. On July 28, 
Google said it would entertain a bid in the range of high $20s to low $30s. On Aug. 1, it came back with a formal 
letter and a $30 offer. 
Enter Mr. Quattrone. On that day, Motorola Mobility hired Mr. Quattrone's Qatalyst Partners and Centerview 
Partners to serve as financial advisers. 
According to the filing it was Qatalyst, which has recently advised some of the largest takeover transactions in the 
technology sector, that prodded Google to go higher. On Aug. 5, after a telephone meeting with Motorola's 
directors, an unidentified Qatalyst representative contacted Google's chief legal officer "to reject the $30 per 
share offer and suggested that Google increase its proposed price to $43.50 per share." 
On Aug. 9, Google came back with $40 a share. 
At the tail end of the process, Motorola Mobility's board considered seeking other buyers, but ultimately 
concluded that it was "preferable" to negotiate on a confidential basis with a single potential acquirer, rather than 
to conduct a private or public auction. Six days later, the deal was done.

Google Inc. on Thursday said it bought restaurant-review company Zagat Survey LLC, thrusting the 
Internet-search giant into the new roles of content creator and print publisher and buttressing its emerging 
local-business advertising business. 
Google didn't disclose the price it paid for New York-based Zagat, whose pocket-sized maroon books rate local 
businesses including restaurants, hotels and other attractions with the help of 350,000 contributors world-wide. 
Zagat, whose online presence is small compared with some competitors, has been called "the gastronomic bible." 
The deal comes at a time when Google -- and its ambitions to capture more local-business ads -- are under 
scrutiny by federal antitrust authorities, who are looking into allegations that the company undermines 
online-review sites such as Yelp by directing its search-engine users to specialized Google Places pages that 
provide information and reviews on local businesses. 
Google has denied any anticompetitive practices but has said it creates its services to benefit users, rate than 
other websites. A Yelp Inc. spokeswoman declined to comment Thursday. 
In an interview, Marissa Mayer, a Google vice president, and Zagat co-founders Nina and Tim Zagat said they 
planned to continue publishing the Zagat books for now and that the company's reviews from more than 100 
countries would be integrated with the business-listing sites Google Maps and Google Places. 
Google has said more than 20% of all searches on its site are related to local businesses. 
The acquisition fits squarely into one of Google's top priorities under Chief Executive Larry Page: providing 
people with information about local businesses, including ratings and reviews. 
Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., is trying to make money by getting local businesses to spend money on 
Web ads -- its main source of revenue -- or offer special discounts to Google's users via Google Offers, among 
other things. The company tried to buy Yelp in 2009, but the deal fell through, people familiar with the matter have 
said. 
Though Google has been on an acquisition spree, picking up many small technology and online-advertising 
companies over the years, it rarely has purchased other well-known consumer brands, let alone companies that 
publish their own content. Last month it agreed to buy Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. for $12.5 billion, and in 
2006 it paid $1.65 billion for YouTube. 
Though Google has been increasingly successful in getting its own users to post local-business reviews, the 
removal of the outside reviews left its business listings with less information. 
Mr. and Mrs. Zagat, who started their company in 1979, will be joining Google and said they expected to remain 
at the company for a period of years. The couple had looked to sell the business in 2008 but gave up after five 
months, citing the fragile economy. Ms. Mayer said she began speaking to them about an acquisition in March of 
this year. 
Zagat's publishing arm is relatively large; the company has said its New York City guide to restaurants sells more 
than 600,000 copies a year. Its website, which gets a small amount of traffic compared with Yelp and others 
rivals, has a partnership with OpenTable.com to help visitors make restaurants reservations.

Ms. Mayer said that partnership "is a healthy one and one we're interested in continuing." Still, OpenTable Inc.'s 
shares were down 8.3% at $57.50 Thursday in 4 p.m. trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

When Google Inc. co-founder Larry Page said that he would take over as chief executive earlier this year, he 
promised that he would shake up the Internet search giant to speed up decision making. Instead, much of the 
shaking up has happened to the new CEO. 
Challenges have piled up for Mr. Page since he assumed his post in April. They include a broad U.S. antitrust 
probe of the company's practices; the settlement of a long-running criminal investigation into Google's advertising 
business; and shifting industry forces that led him to make a deal to buy mobile-device maker Motorola Mobility 
Holdings Inc. Since he took on his new role, the company's stock price has declined 9.1%, compared with a drop 
of 8.4% for Nasdaq stocks as a whole. 
Last week, federal prosecutors who had investigated Google's practice of allowing ads from illegal online 
pharmacies on its Web search engine between 2003 and 2009 singled out Mr. Page. They said he had personal 
knowledge of the alleged crime and failed to prevent it. The federal prosecutors made their comments after 
Google paid $500 million last week to avoid criminal charges. 
A Google spokesman declined to comment on what Mr. Page did or didn't know of the ad practices. He added 
that "the investigation was not related to current advertising practices and that the company was moving on." The 
company declined to make Mr. Page, 38 years old, available for comment. 
Other setbacks have included a failure to reach a deal with music labels that would let Google's new Internet 
music service sell songs and albums; a public disclosure by the company in June that China-based "bad actors" 
spied on Gmail accounts, and the failure to win a July auction for Nortel Networks Corp.'s technology patents, 
which Google said pushed it to make its purchase of Motorola. 
But according to colleagues, Mr. Page has dealt with the eventful past few months by focusing on matters within 
his control, including positioning Google in new lines of business. 
"Larry's very aware of all the things that are playing out internally and externally, and he cares about it," said 
Sundar Pichai, who leads Google's Chrome browser and operating system. "While he takes all that into his mind, 
the way he approaches work is with a strong focus around products and users." 
There have also been positives. His reorganization of the company was largely well-received by employees; in 
April, the government approved Google's purchase of ITA Software, which will help Google build a travel-search 
service; and Google+, the company's fledgling attempt at social networking, has seen early growth. Employees 
also credit Mr. Page with facilitating a change in the look of numerous Google services, including the search 
engine and Gmail. 
Mr. Page has also learned from criticism. Amid questions about Google's growth, Wall Street analysts had griped 
in April that they didn't hear enough from Mr. Page on his first earnings call. During that call, the new CEO said he 
was "really excited" about the company's performance and prospects but didn't discuss his strategy or stay to 
answer questions from analysts. 
But on the July quarterly call, which followed stronger results, the new CEO spoke extensively about his strategy. 
Among other things, he said Google would have no trouble finding ways to earn money from the growth of its 
Chrome Web browser, YouTube video site and Android mobile-operating software, which powers more than 135 
million devices world-wide.

Google is "only at 1% of what is possible" and "that is why I am here working hard to lead the company into the 
next level," Mr. Page said during the call. 
Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., said Mr. Page "has been a pretty quick study" in 
communicating with investors. "It's clear that Larry Page isn't satisfied with Google's dominant position in Web 
search and intends to broaden the areas of dominance," Mr. Rohan added, even though that is inviting more 
government scrutiny and "bumps in the road." 
Internally, numerous Google employees say Mr. Page enjoys a broad base of support. Over the past few months, 
he has tried to shake up the company as he promised he would, clarifying lines of accountability and priorities 
through a broad reorganization. In addition, he eliminated projects that didn't contribute to those priorities. 
Mr. Page has also taken an interest in newer products, such as local-business advertising initiatives and Google+, 
the social-networking and Facebook Inc. rival whose performance Mr. Page has tied to the size of employee 
bonuses this year. 
Meanwhile, with employees, Mr. Page has tried to shed his image as an introvert. Still, the external headaches 
have forced Mr. Page to respond quickly. Earlier this summer, Google said it was facing a broad U.S. Federal 
Trade Commission investigation into its practices that could take years to resolve. 
After that, Google in July changed the way its search engine displays information about local businesses, which is 
among the issues the FTC is probing, according to people familiar with the matter.

Can Motorola Folks Become Googlers?

Can Motorola Folks Become Googlers?

Google is in unchartered waters with its acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings and its 19,000 employees, 
which would increase its global workforce by 66% upon completion of the deal. Like any ship in choppy seas, the 
rookie sailors are most at risk. 
In typical mergers, the acquiring company is expected to lay off people in duplicate positions. Google, a software 
company, and Motorola, a manufacturer, are on opposite ends of the technology spectrum, so the usual rules 
may not apply. 
"Because Motorola is in such a different industry, Google won't be comfortable coming in and taking control of the 
manufacturing operations and handset design; it's just not their core competency so they have to leave Motorola 
virtually intact," said Kerry Rice, an Internet analyst who covers Google at Needham Company. 
The jobs of most Motorola employees are safe, analysts said, and it's even possible they may get some Google 
benefits such as lavish perks and above-market salary compensation. 
In the short-term, analysts said, Google will keep to its word of maintaining Motorola as a separate entity and 
layoffs will be few and far between. For Motorola employees, that may mean they will eventually get a taste of the 
lavish perks that Googlers are known to enjoy. 
"One scenario is that Google is telling the truth and they run it as a separate company with a better parent 
company and more capital, and employment goes up, and there is even room for perks and salary growth," said 
Matthew Thornton, a senior analyst at Avian Securities, LLC, who covers telecommunications. In a blog post 
announcing the merger, CEO Larry Page wrote, "we will run Motorola as a separate business." 
Motorola did not respond to requests for comment. 
Some Motorola employees fear layoffs and are selling their stock, assuming that the company's share price, 
which jumped 56% on the announcement Monday, won't go higher soon, said one employee at the company's 
Libertyville, Ill., headquarters. Others hope Google will accelerate the transformation of the company's sluggish 
corporate culture that began under CEO Sanjay Jha. Many hope to call themselves Googlers someday soon, said 
the employee, a software engineer. 
Motorola will host a "town hall" meeting for its employees next week to answer questions about the merger, 
according to a memo sent to employees by Jha after the merger announcement. 
Since Jha was hired from Qualcomm Inc. in 2008, Motorola's mobile phone business has undergone many painful 
re-organizations, including thousands of layoffs, and more mundane cost-cutting measures such as moving office 
e-mail and word processing from Microsoft Office and Exchange to Google Apps. 
While the 83-year-old company has been badly wounded by the company's missteps and failures in the mobile 
market, Jha's reforms have helped re-build morale, said Thornton, the Avian Securities analyst. 
"I think the Silicon Valley culture has crept in there and I think there's a renewed sense of pride," Thornton said of 
Motorola. "It's been a painful process, but it's a place where people want to work." 
The downsizing of the last few years may also help protect the company's remaining employees, said Mark 
McKechnie, a telecom equipment analyst at ThinkEquity LLC. "Motorola was a fairly lean operation. They were on 
the razor's edge of being profitable," he said. Motorolalost $56 million in its most recent quarter.

Other scenarios that could play out include Google selling the hardware components of Motorola, keeping only 
the patent portfolio it needs to protect its Android operating system. If Google couldn't find a buyer for the 
hardware business, it could close operations and sell manufacturing facilities. In that case, many employees 
would lose their jobs, Thornton said. 
Most analysts agree that significant changes won't occur for Motorola employees for at least two years. "It's really 
six months until the deal goes through, then six months of absorbing the company, so it's two years before you 
see impact and influence on Motorola and its operations," said Clayton Moran, a senior analyst at Benchmark 
Company covering Google. 
What Google does with Motorola will have less to do with acquisition's 19,000 employees and more to do with 
Google's long-term business interests, said Gene Munster, a senior research analyst at PiperJaffray who covers 
Google. Having a hand in designing handsets will take a backseat to preserving the Android "ecosystem" in which 
many companies all have free access to the mobile operating system, Munster said.

The Google -Motorola Deal: The Man Behind the Rise of Android 
The Google-Motorola Deal: The Man Behind the Rise of Android

At the core of Google Inc.'s $12.5 billion Motorola deal is Silicon Valley engineer Andy Rubin, who in six years 
has reordered the wireless market and positioned the Internet giant as a central player in it. 
Mr. Rubin, 48 years old, has changed Google's organizational structure and become one of the most powerful 
people at the company. Under his leadership, the operating system known as Android has become the most 
widely used software on smartphones -- surpassing the creations of Apple Inc. and Nokia Corp. -- and powering 
tablets from many companies. 
Mr. Rubin's success has enabled Google's search engine and digital-advertising business to spread rapidly 
through the mobile world. 
When Google co-founder Larry Page became CEO in April, Mr. Rubin was promoted to be one of 18 senior vice 
presidents. His star has continued to rise, culminating in his personal involvement in Monday's deal for Motorola 
Mobility Holdings Inc., said a person familiar with the matter. 
People close to the deal said one of Google's motivations was its desire to design devices, not just the software 
that powers them, thus giving it the sort of influence that rival Apple enjoys with its iPhone and iPad. 
Google declined to make Mr. Rubin available for an interview. 
A longtime builder of phones, Mr. Rubin started Android in 2003 but struggled to get funding. 
Android attracted Google's attention in part because Mr. Rubin had previously met Google founders Mr. Page and 
Sergey Brin, who were fans of a phone called the Sidekick, which Mr. Rubin had helped build while running an 
earlier start-up called Danger. 
Between 2005 and 2007, Android was largely a secret project within Google. Its mission: create a modern 
operating system for smartphones that would allow powerful Internet applications and break the stranglehold of 
wireless carriers, who then dictated which applications could be installed on phones. 
Unlike Microsoft, which levied fees on device makers that used its mobile operating system, Google planned to 
give away Android software, believing it could make back its investment through online-ads served up on the 
phones. Android's open-source development plan also allowed programmers outside Google to help enhance the 
software. 
By 2007, with about 100 engineers working for him, Mr. Rubin began to negotiate with partners on creating the 
first Android phone, even as Google was developing mobile applications including Web search and Google Maps 
for the still-secret Apple iPhone, which didn't launch until that June. 
In mid-2007 he faced a setback when LG Electronics Co. backed out of a deal to build the first Android phone, 
said a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Rubin then turned to little-known HTC Corp., which had built a phone 
for Microsoft. 
With the launch of the iPhone, Apple became a major competitor but also provided a boost to Android. The 
iPhone's strong sales spurred handset makers to take up Android.

Page 21 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
By November, Samsung Electronics Co., Motorola and LG all signed on to Google's "open handset alliance," a 
consortium of more than 30 hardware makers, carriers and application companies that said they would help build 
Android devices. 
The first Android phone, the G1, launched in the fall of 2008 to poor reviews but impressed hardware makers and 
carriers enough for them to begin approaching Mr. Rubin. Android's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., 
became a mecca for mobile CEOs. 
In the middle of 2009, when Android still had around 150 employees, Mr. Rubin decided he wanted a dedicated 
business team -- an unheard of concept at Google. 
Not all has gone smoothly. Mr. Rubin's effort in early 2010 to sell the Google-branded HTC Nexus One 
smartphone directly to consumers got bogged down. Yet the broader Android strategy was working, as device 
makers continued to build better Android smartphones. 
Mr. Rubin and the rest of the Android team were elated when Apple CEO Steve Jobs took a swipe at them in the 
fall of 2010, said a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Jobs said that Android was problematic because 
customers and app developers such as TweetDeck had to deal with a "mess" of numerous versions of the 
software. 
In a blog post, however, the CEO of TweetDeck, Iain Dodsworth, came to Android's defense, saying it wasn't 
difficult to work with.

Two Paths for Google and Motorola

Two Paths for Google and Motorola

Google turned the world upside down yesterday with its $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility, its biggest 
acquisition ever -- and nobody even saw it coming. Except, well, Google. CEO Larry Page's statement during the 
company's earnings call just a month ago now seems like a sly hint of the blockbuster deal to come. 
"I see more opportunities for Google today than ever before, because believe it or not, we are still in the very early 
stages of what we want to do," he said. What the company wants to do, some analysts believe, is become the 
dominant player in both smartphone operating systems, which it already is, and in the handsets themselves. 
At least one analyst argues that despite its protestations that this acquisition is a defensive measure against 
patent litigation, Google will eventually shut out its "partners" from Android, making Google the sole proprietor of 
the super popular Android phones. 
If Google does keep the Motorola Mobility hardware business -- rather than eventually sell it off -- its employees 
may not only be safe from layoffs, but could actually see their ranks grow. 
"Absolutely Motorola will add employees on the R&D and wireless front," Will Strauss, president of Forward 
Concepts, a Phoenix, Ariz.-based boutique market research firm specializing in the wireless semiconductor 
industry, told FINS. After a few years of layoffs and downsizing, the company's hiring is now on the uptick, 
Strauss said. 
Motorola Mobility recently agreed to retain its headquarters and 3,000 jobs in Libertyville, Illinois in exchange for 
$100 million in tax breaks over 10 years, plus $4.25 million for capital expenses and jobs training. 
But under a new Google regime, Motorola Mobility's tech teams could eventually begin to migrate west to 
California, where Google is headquartered and where many wireless companies are located, including San 
Diego's Qualcomm, Strauss said. Motorola Mobility CEO Sanjay Jha, a former Qualcomm executive, still 
maintains a home in San Diego and commutes to Libertyville during the week. 
Motorola "has very little talent they can steal in the Chicago area in the world of wireless," Strauss said. "You 
want to go where the skilled bodies are." 
Of course, maybe the thought of integrating its new acquisition's 19,000 employees into its 28,768-person 
workforce is too big a challenge for Google and it downsizes Motorola Mobility, putting the handset maker's 
employees at risk of losing their jobs. 
"It's kind of clumsy for Google to own a handset company," said Mark McKechnie, a telecom equipment analyst at 
ThinkEquity LLC in San Francisco. "To me, Google did this for intellectual property and not for the handset 
business. As of right now they keep it running, but I don't rule out any de-emphasis of the handset company" in 
the future.

Internet heavyweight Google has snapped up Motorola's former mobile phone unit for $US12.5 billion in its largest 
acquisition yet. 
Saying the deal will give it access to thousands of patents that will help to protect its Android operating system 
from "anti-competitive actions" from rivals Apple and Microsoft, Google added that the deal would "supercharge" 
its mobile phone software. 
The mobile industry is in a fierce fight for intellectual property with Google, Microsoft, Apple, Samsung and others 
fighting in the courts for supremacy in the global smartphone and tablet computing market. 
Google is a relative newcomer to mobiles but has made rapid inroads in recent years, flogging its Android 
operating system to numerous handset manufacturers around the world, such as Taiwan giant HTC. Since late 
2007, Google has placed Android on more than 150 million handsets. 
However, the Motorola Mobility buy marks a game-changing move for Google, as it pits the search giant against 
dominant hardware players such as Apple and Nokia, as well as a raft of companies that use Android as 
operating system of choice for their mobile phone handsets. 
The deal is almost certain to heighten anti-trust concerns about Google's activities, which span everything from a 
dominant position in the search advertising market to electronic online libraries, voice over internet telephone, 
mobile phone operating systems, cloud-based office productivity applications and now mobile phone hardware. 
In a post to a Google blog, chief executive and founder Larry Page said Motorola's early commitment to use the 
Android operating system in 2008 made the Motorola Mobility business a "natural fit" for Google that would 
"supercharge" Android. 
Motorola was formerly the Mobile Devices division of Motorola until it split from its parent company in January to 
become Motorola Mobility Holdings. 
Mr Page was quick to paint the Motorola Mobility buy as a defence against "anti-competitive patent attacks" 
from Microsoft and Apple. 
"Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Google's patent portfolio, which will enable 
us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies," he said. 
Last month, Apple and Microsoft led a consortium of technology companies in a $US4.5 billion purchase of 
roughly 6000 patents from Nortel Networks, the Canadian telecommunications maker that filed for bankruptcy in 
2008. World No. 5 smartphone maker HTC has publicly backed Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility but 
analysts expect the deal is causing some angst behind closed doors. Photo: Reuters 
Google, which lost out in the bidding, criticised the deal as an anti-competitive strategy. Several weeks later, 
Google acquired more than 1000 patents from IBM. Motorola holds more than 17,000 patents. 
"This is an emphatic exclamation point that Google is a mobile company," Macquarie Capital analyst Ben 
Schachter told The New York Times. "This is clearly a defensive deal, they were backed in a corner and they had 
to protect the Android platform."

The price of $US40 a share represented a 63 per cent premium to Motorola Mobility's closing price on Friday. 
The deal was unanimously approved by both boards. 
"It's a lot of money," Richard Windsor, Nomura global tech specialist, said. "Our valuation is substantially below 
that price." 
Telstra chief executive David Thodey said the deal made sense because Google needed to own a major handset 
maker to produce devices to compete with Apple. He said the Android operating system needed "a deeper level 
of integration" with the phones it was running on, but questioned whether the Silicon Valley behemoth might have 
bitten off more than it could chew. 
"The real question is . . . how will Google go at actually being a manufacturer?" he asked. "Google's model is to 
never talk to a customer. How will that work if it's now the Google phone. Who's going to provide the support?" 
Mr Page, meanwhile, sought to assuage any concerns that Google's Android mobile phone manufacturing 
partners might have. "This acquisition will not change our commitment to run Android as an open platform," he 
said. "Motorola will remain a licensee of Android and Android remain open. We will run Motorola as a separate 
business." 
Google has released quotes from key mobile phone hardware partners HTC, Samsung, LG and Sony Electronics 
backing the deal, but Gartner research director Michael Gartner said a less positive reaction was likely behind 
closed doors. 
"You have to wonder what kind of a morning the folks at HTC, Samsung, LG and Sony Ericsson are having right 
now," Mr Gartner told AFP. 
"This puts a lot of pressure on third-party OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] who built their businesses on 
Android." Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer is tipped to make a renewed pitch to some of Google's biggest mobile 
phone partners. Photo: Reuters 
However, while Mr Gartner said a lot of companies in the industry would need a strategy rethink, the deal could 
also put Google in a bind. "The challenge for Google is very simple – nobody has ever successfully licensed a 
platform and competed with licensees. Because if you do better, your licensees get frustrated . . . If your licensees 
do better than you then you get frustrated, even if no money is changing hands." 
In the mid-1990s, Apple allowed hardware makers to licence its operating system to build so-called Macintosh 
clones. Chief executive Steve Jobs abandoned it as ill-conceived. 
Forrester Research analyst John McCarthy said the deal could open the door for Microsoft to move on Google's 
mobile phone manufacturing partners. Microsoft has faced broad criticism over its mobile phone operating system 
and struggled to gain real traction as Apple's and Google's efforts reaped big rewards. 
"Forrester can hear [Microsoft boss] Steve Ballmer and company pitching the Asian players on how Microsoft is 
the only hardware agnostic player left," he told AAP. 
Discussing the deal on a conference call, Google expressed confidence that it would win regulatory approval, but 
legal experts have said the buy is likely to attract scrutiny. 
Google has faced increasing calls for regulators to rein in its activities as it spreads its reach throughout internet 
and mobile communications and it is already the subject of a US Federal Trade Commission investigation of its 
strength in online search. 
"We think this is a competitive transaction," Google chief legal officer David Drummond said. "This is not a 
horizontal transaction, Google has not materially been in the handset business." 
But Santa Clara Law associate professor Eric Goldman told Reuters that US authorities could take action, either 
directly against Google or more broadly in the industry.

Shares of HTC Corp, the worlds No. 5 smartphone maker, closed unchanged yesterday amid investor concerns 
that Google Incs acquisition of US handset maker Motorola Mobility could undermine its partnerships with 
Android handset makers, such as HTC, thus jeopardizing HTCs market position in the long run. 
Analysts also said the likelihood of Google helping to boost HTCs patent strength in its lawsuits with Apple Inc 
looked slim in the near term. 
The Google-Motorola deal, however, sent the stock prices of Motorolas local handset suppliers, Compal 
Communications Inc and Arima Communications Corp, soaring by the daily 7 percent limit to NT$32.15 and 
NT$19.75 respectively, as the deal is expected to boost Motorolas Android smartphone portfolio. 
Everybody is betting on a Motorola turnaround. Motorola will get more help from Google to push its Android 
handsets with the deal, Yuanta Securities Co analyst Bonnie Chang said. 
HTC yesterday said the Google-Motorola deal would not affect its partnership with Google. 
The HTCs stock price closed at NT$827, retreating from a 2.9 percent gain in early trading yesterday. The 
benchmark TAIEX fell 0.27 percent. 
This is a positive development for the Android ecosystem, which we believe will benefit HTCs promotion of 
Android phones, HTC said in a statement. The partnership between HTC and Google remains strong and will not 
be affected by this acquisition. 
However, the acquisition of Motorola could turn Google from a partner to a competitor with the more than 30 
Android-operated handset companies, analysts said. 
We believe that the potential increase of Motorola Mobilitys competitiveness may also bring more pressure to 
other Android phone makers, Citigroup analyst Kevin Chang said yesterday in a report. 
With a 14 percent market share, HTC is the biggest Android handset maker in the US, where the Android system 
has outpaced rival operating systems such as Microsoft Corps Windows Mobile, according to market searcher 
Nielsens tally. Motorola came next with an 11 percent share. 
Morgan Stanley shared Citigroups concerns. 
We are concerned whether HTC can maintain its lead [position in the] long-term, Morgan Stanley said in a report. 
Although Google plans to run Motorola Mobility as a separate business, it may be tempted to favor it when 
launching new versions of the Android operating system, Morgan Stanley said. 
That could lead to a change in the landscape of the global mobile operating system market. Android held a 43.4 
percent share of the smartphone market at the end of the second quarter this year, ahead of Nokia Corps 22 
percent and Apples 18 percent, according to statistics from market researcher Gartner Inc. 
Macquarie said existing Android makers may begin to consider shifting some resources to Windows 7 devices, 
while IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said the deal was a wake-up call for most Android players, prompting them 
to realize how dependent they are on Google and how quickly Googles plans can change their businesses.

On Monday, Google CEO Larry Page told investors during a conference call that this would not happen, saying 
Motorola would be run as a separate company that licenses Android software, just as firms such as HTC and LG 
Electronics Inc do. 
In fact, the acquisition of Motorola Mobility would better protect the Android ecosystem, Google told its top five 
partners that, as the deal included 17,000 granted patents. 
However, UBS said it expected the deal would do little help to HTCs current legal battle with Apple. 
HTC may still have to resolve the legal issues that are unrelated to the Android operating system, UBS said. 
The US International Trade Commission ruled on July 15 that HTC had infringed on two of Apples patents. They 
were not directly linked to the Android operating system, as the commission ruled against all of Apples claims 
against Android. 
HTC shipped 11.02 million units of smartphones last quarter, almost double its shipments of 5.91 million for the 
same period last year, according to Gartner. Its global market share also expanded to 2.6 percent from 1.6 
percent.

Google's acquisition of handset maker Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion may well be "the deal of the year" 
that reshapes the global market for smartphones and media tablets in the near term, analysts said. 
Apple, whose innovation has driven the adoption of those devices and the software that runs on them, must now 
a face a rival with nearly similar strength in integrating hardware expertise, advanced software and a large 
developer community. 
Larry Page, co-founder and chief executive of internet search giant Google, could not have made that goal 
clearer after announcing the Motorola Mobility acquisition on Monday: "Together, we will create amazing user 
experiences that supercharge the entire Android ecosystem for the benefit of consumers, partners and 
developers." 
Launched in November 2007, Google's Android operating system now powers more than 160 million devices 
produced by a network of 39 manufacturers. These devices are supported by 231 telecommunications network 
operators in 123 countries. 
According to a report by market research firm In-Stat, the Motorola Mobility deal provides Google with the 
opportunity to "[enable] its vision in the way that Apple enables its vision with its products". 
Android's big advantage of being adopted by different manufacturers for a range of so-called smart devices has 
apparently become a major drawback. 
"Many smartphone manufacturers produce Android smartphones, and as tough competitors will do, each has 
tried to make its Android phones stand out from the crowd with unique tweaks," In-Stat said. "With the many 
versions of Android currently being shipped in phones [and tablets], each with different hardware capabilities, you 
have a bit of a mess." 
As an example, Lenovo Group's mainland-released media tablet, LePad, runs a version of Android that has been 
customised to support features designed for the local market. 
Although Google innovated consistently with the Android platform, it has failed to effectively tie software upgrades 
to new hardware which developers could leverage in order to create compelling new applications. The Motorola 
Mobility acquisition is intended to correct that flaw. By comparison, Apple built support for the iOS operating 
system - used on its iPhone and iPad - by developing hardware and software that worked in conjunction with 
applications offered by the company's App Store. 
"Providing developers with an environment in which they can succeed will be critical to building long-term support, 
which is essential to consumer interest," said Josh Martin, of research firm Strategy Analytics. 
Tim Renowden, an analyst at Ovum, said the Motorola deal would transform Google into a so-called "managed 
device platform", in which it controls all aspects of Android - including hardware, software, content and online 
services. 
Another highly touted result of that transaction is the significant intellectual property treasure chest that Google 
will possess.

Page 29 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Motorola Mobility chief executive Sanjay Jha said the company has more than 17,000 patents granted 
worldwide and more than 7,500 applications pending. 
"We have tremendous strength, not only in wireless standards but also wireless non-essential patents, which are 
the patents which are required to deliver competitive products in the marketplace," Jha said. "As a result of the 
combination of these patents, we believe we'll be able to provide a much better support to the businesses at 
Motorola Mobility, as well as support the Android ecosystem." 
The acquisition is expected to bolster Google's negotiating position with Apple, in the event that Apple takes legal 
action over other Android-based products the same way it did with Samsung Electronics products in Europe. 
Apple was granted injunctions against the sale of Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia and every European 
Union member state except the Netherlands. That device, a rival of the iPad, is the subject of a patent lawsuit by 
Apple against the South Korean manufacturer. 
"If nothing else, Google will be able to assert Motorola's intellectual property for the 3GPP and 3GPP2 cellular 
phone specifications, which are used in both the iPhone and iPad," said Francis Sideco, principal analyst for 
wireless communications at market research firm IHS iSuppli. 
Pierre Ferragu, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein, described that patent portfolio as "a game changer" for Google. 
Besides providing a defence against litigation from Apple and Microsoft, "it will most likely help Google defend 
itself in the ongoing dispute with Oracle", Ferragu said. 
Oracle sued Google last year, claiming that Android infringed its Java patents. Oracle got those patents when it 
bought Sun Microsystems last year. Oracle claimed damages of up to US$6.1 billion. 
Despite Page's declaration that Motorola Mobility was "a natural fit" for Google, there are analysts that see a 
future divestment of the hardware manufacturing assets. 
"We do not believe that Google is interested at becoming a phone vendor," said Gartner analyst Carolina 
Milanesi. "This is about defending Android and moving it forward with the right developments." 
Macquarie Securities said HTC and Samsung could be interested, but Huawei Technologies was a more likely 
buyer. "By acquiring Motorola Mobility, Huawei could share higher brand recognition, leading to market share 
expansion," it said. "Both companies share a similar culture as low-cost handset makers, which could benefit 
them in unifying their supply chain management."

Google on August 15th, 2011 entered into a contract with Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. to 
acquire the company at USD 40 per share in cash (approximately USD 12.5 billion). The contract 
has been approved by the boards of directors of both the companies. The purpose of this 
acquisition is to maximise the advantages from the android ecosystem and the betterment of 
mobile computing. 
Commenting on the acquisition, Larry Page, CEO, Google said “Motorola Mobility’s total 
commitment to Android has created a natural fit for our two companies. Together, we will 
create amazing user experiences that supercharge the entire Android ecosystem for the benefit 
of consumers, partners and developers. I look forward to welcoming Motorolans to our family of 
Googlers.” 
Also speaking about the deal, Sanjay Jha, CEO, Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. said “This 
transaction offers significant value for Motorola Mobility’s stockholders and provides compelling 
new opportunities for our employees, customers, and partners around the world. We have 
shared a productive partnership with Google to advance the Android platform, and now through 
this combination we will be able to do even more to innovate and deliver outstanding mobility 
solutions across our mobile devices and home businesses.” 
Google will operate Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. as a separate business. Motorola Mobility 
Holdings, Inc. will remain a licensee of Android and Android operating system will remain as 
an open operating system. This acquisition is the biggest investment done by Google so far. 
Google launched its open operating system, Android in 2007. In four years, this operating system 
has become one of three leading operating systems most in demand by consumers, whose 
market share has increased to 43.4 per cent in 2Q2011 as compared to 17.2 per cent in 2Q2010 
globally1. With this acquisition, Google will enter into the smartphone manufacturing business 
completely, and hence give a tough competition to other manufacturers including Apple (Apple 
iOS manufacturer) and Research In Motion (Blackberry OS manufacturer), who are already losing

At the core of Google Inc.'s (GOOG) $12.5 billion Motorola deal is Silicon Valley engineer Andy Rubin, who in six 
years has reordered the wireless market and positioned the Internet giant as a central player in it. 
Mr. Rubin, 48 years old, has changed Google's organizational structure and become one of the most powerful 
people at the company. Under his leadership, the operating system known as Android has become the most 
widely used software on smartphones--surpassing the creations of Apple Inc. (AAPL)and Nokia Corp. (NOK, 
NOK1V.HE)--and powering tablets from many companies. 
Mr. Rubin's success has enabled Google's search engine and digital-advertising business to spread rapidly 
through the mobile world. He has also played a role in recruiting talent to Google, including Andy Hertzfeld, a 
former Apple programmer who helped develop Google+, the company's new social network. 
(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal website, WSJ.com.) 
When Google co-founder Larry Page became CEO in April, Mr. Rubin was promoted to be one of 18 senior vice 
presidents. His star has continued to rise, culminating in his personal involvement in Monday's deal for Motorola 
Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI), said a person familiar with the matter. 
People close to the deal said one of Google's motivations was its desire to design devices, not just the software 
that powers them, thus giving it the sort of influence that rival Apple enjoys with its iPhone and iPad. 
That would play into the strengths of Mr. Rubin, who for years built gadgets for start-ups, one of which was 
acquired by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) in 1997 only to lose momentum. 
Google declined to make Mr. Rubin available for an interview. 
Colleagues call him an inveterate tinkerer who tries to anticipate industry changes but also loves details such as 
writing software code. They also say he is a demanding boss and can sometimes be difficult to work with, leading 
to turnover and burnout in Android's ranks. People at other companies in the mobile market privately argue that 
Mr. Rubin wields too much influence over handset designs by companies using Android software. 
But these colleagues also say Mr. Rubin is loyal and generous to his team of several hundred employees. About 
every six months, he throws a party for employees at his home, which, like Google, is in Mountain View, Calif. 
After the first Android phone launched in the fall of 2008, triggering a multimillion payout in Mr. Rubin's contract, 
he gave a portion of that money to all of his employees as a bonus--the first of its kind at Google, said a person 
familiar with the matter. Employees received anywhere from $10,000 to around $50,000, the person said. 
Steve Perlman, a close friend and frequent colleague of Mr. Rubin's since the 1980s, when both worked at Apple, 
said making robots is a favorite personal pastime for Mr. Rubin. The Chappaqua, N.Y., native has filled his Silicon 
Valley house with robots. (The name of the start-up he sold to Google in 2005--Android Inc.--reflects his passion 
for robots). 
A longtime builder of phones, he started Android in 2003 but struggled to get funding. At one point he needed Mr. 
Perlman's cash to pay office rent. 
Android attracted Google's attention- in part- because Mr. Rubin had previously met Google founders Mr. Page 
and Sergey Brin, who were fans of a phone called the Sidekick, which Mr. Rubin had helped build while running

Page 34 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
an earlier start-up called Danger. The Android acquisition--which amounted to Mr. Rubin and several other 
employees--raised eyebrows in Silicon Valley. But Google didn't disclose what it planned to do with the business. 
Between 2005 and 2007, Android was largely a secret project within Google. Its mission: create a modern 
operating system for smartphones that would allow powerful Internet applications and break the stranglehold of 
wireless carriers, who then dictated which applications could be installed on phones. 
Unlike Microsoft, which levied fees on device makers that used its mobile operating system, Google planned to 
give away Android software, believing it could make back its investment through online-ads served up on the 
phones. Android's open-source development plan also allowed programmers outside Google to help enhance the 
software. 
By 2007, with about 100 engineers working for him, Mr. Rubin began to negotiate with partners on creating the 
first Android phone, even as Google was developing mobile applications including Web search and Google Maps 
for the still-secret Apple iPhone, which didn't launch until that June. 
In mid-2007, he faced a setback when LG Electronics Co. (066570.SE) backed out of a deal to build the first 
Android phone, said a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Rubin then turned to little-known HTC Corp. (HTCXF, 
2498.TW), which had built a phone for Microsoft. He also secured deal with T-Mobile USA, which provided 
wireless plans for the phone, and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), which provided the phone's microprocessor. 
With the launch of the iPhone, Apple became a major competitor but also provided a boost to Android. The 
iPhone's strong sales spurred handset makers to take up Android, after they struggled to build their own operating 
software. 
By November, Samsung Electronics Co., Motorola and LG all signed on to Google's "open handset alliance," a 
consortium of more than 30 hardware makers, carriers and application companies that said they would help build 
Android devices. 
When asked for his reaction to the alliance, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer nearly cracked up laughing during a 
press conference in Tokyo. "We have many, many millions of customers," he said. "They're welcome in our 
world." (Microsoft now has a very small market share in smartphone operating systems.) 
The first Android phone, the G1, launched in the fall of 2008 to poor reviews but impressed hardware makers and 
carriers enough for them to begin approaching Mr. Rubin. Android's headquarters at Building 44 on the Google 
campus in Mountain View, Calif., became a mecca for mobile CEOs--and, at times, awkward encounters between 
executives from rivals who would see each other in the halls, said a person familiar with the matter. 
In the summer of 2009, then-Verizon Wireless CEO Lowell McAdam visited Building 44, cementing the shift in 
power. That fall, Motorola and Verizon Wireless sparked new adoption of Android by releasing the Droid with a 
huge marketing campaign by Verizon Wireless. The device and its later versions gained traction with consumers. 
In the middle of 2009, when Android still had around 150 employees, Mr. Rubin decided he wanted a dedicated 
business team--an unheard of concept at Google, where engineers and business executives had separate 
organizations, these people said. With support from then-CEO Eric Schmidt, Mr. Rubin created the first "business 
unit" inside of Google. Since then other groups, including the Chrome browser team, have become business 
units. 
Not all has gone smoothly. Mr. Rubin's effort in early 2010 to sell the Google-branded HTC Nexus One 
smartphone directly to consumers got bogged down when Google tried to connect its phone site to wireless 
carrier systems for billing and credit checks, among other problems. 
Inside of the Android team, the failure of Nexus One was a huge letdown, said a person familiar with the matter. 
Mr. Rubin said in an interview at the time that Google "broke even" on the investment. 
Yet the broader Android strategy was working, as device makers continued to build better Android smartphones. 
Mr. Rubin and the rest of the Android team were elated when Apple CEO Steve Jobs took a swipe at them in the 
fall of 2010, said a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Jobs said during an earnings conference call that Android 
was problematic because customers and app developers such as TweetDeck had to deal with a "mess" of 
numerous versions of the software. 
In a blog post, however, the CEO of TweetDeck, Iain Dodsworth, came to Android's defense, saying it wasn't 
difficult to work with.

Google has acquired Motorola Mobility, the No. 1 U.S. mobile phone maker and pioneer in the field of mobile 
communications devices. The Internet search giant, which produces and supplies the Android operating system 
to cellphone makers, has followed in Apple's footsteps by entering the smartphone market. If Google decides to 
charge other phone makers to use its Android OS system or give Motorola priority over other smartphone makers, 
Korean companies such as Samsung and LG electronics are expected to feel the brunt as they have until now 
received Android for free. Google CEO Larry Page wrote in his official blog on Monday that Google has agreed to 
buy Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion, or $40 a share, which marks a 63 percent premium on Motorola's 
closing price of $24.47 on Friday. The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies, and the merger 
will be completed early next year. 
"Google acquired Motorola Mobility, but the Android OS will continue to be operated as an open platform," Page 
said. "Motorola will remain as a manufacturer that uses the Android OS under license." But Google's acquisition 
effectively creates a powerful new rival for Korean smartphone makers. Motorola, which was established in 1928, 
was the first company to begin commercial sales of cell phones, a market it dominated globally with Nokia until 
the early 2000s. However Motorola quickly lost its share to Samsung and other Korean cellphone makers as it 
failed to transition to digital quickly enough and was impacted further by the popularity of Apple's iPhones. Early 
this year, Motorola divided its operations into communications equipment manufacturing (Motorola Solutions) and 
cellphone making (Motorola Mobility).

CAIRO: Google is entering the mobile computing competition and increasing its patent portfolio with its $12.5 
billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility. 
The deal shows that Google is easing out of its comfort zone and promising an enhanced Android experience. 
“Together, we will create amazing user experiences that supercharge the entire Android ecosystem for the benefit 
of consumers, partners and developers,” Larry Page, CEO of Google, said in a statement. 
Google will pay Motorola Mobility $40 per share cash, a 63 percent premium to the closing price of Motorola 
Mobility shares on Friday, according to a statement. 
“We have shared a productive partnership with Google to advance the Android platform, and now through this 
combination we will be able to do even more to innovate and deliver outstanding mobility solutions across our 
mobile devices and home businesses,” Sanjay Jha, CEO of Motorola Mobility, said. 
Despite the acquisition, Motorola Mobility, a dedicated Android partner, promises that Android will remain open 
and that it will remain a licenses. 
“Motorola Mobility’s total commitment to Android has created a natural fit for our two companies,” Page said. 
Google plans to run Motorola Mobility as a separate business. 
Andy Rubin, senior vice president of mobile at Google, said that Google will continue working with their Android 
partners to develop and distribute innovative Android-powered devices. 
“Our vision for Android is unchanged and Google remains firmly committed to Android as an open platform and a 
vibrant open source community,” Rubin said. 
Jha said that this transaction offers significant value for Motorola Mobility’s stockholders and “provides 
compelling new opportunities for our employees, customers, and partners around the world.” 
The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals in the US, 
the European Union and other jurisdictions, and the approval of Motorola Mobility’s stockholders. 
It is expected to close by the end of 2011 or early 2012. 
“I look forward to welcoming Motorolans to our family of Googlers,” Page said.

Motorola acquisition a huge gamble for Google

Less than six months after taking over as chief executive, Google co-founder Larry Page has placed the Internet 
giant's most audacious wager yet. 
The $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility dwarfs Google's previous purchases and thrusts a company 
that has made its fortune in Internet search and advertising into an entirely new arena -- hardware. 
The Illinois-based Motorola Mobility makes mobile phones, tablet computers and TV set-top boxes -- areas 
where the Silicon Valley-based Google has no experience other than writing the software to power the devices. 
Integrating an 80-year-old company with 19,000 employees and manufacturing plants around the world will pose 
a serious challenge and technology analysts are divided on whether Google can carry it off. 
Whether it does or not, analysts are unanimous in saying that the bold move by the 38-year-old Page, who 
replaced Eric Schmidt as Google's chief executive in April, has changed the landscape of the booming mobile 
industry. 
"The repercussions are huge," Gartner research director Michael Gartenberg told AFP. "It shows that it's so hard 
to look at this market beyond the short term because we've seen so many twists and changes. 
"Palm went from irrelevant to being bought by Hewlett-Packard, Nokia was on the ropes and suddenly you have a 
new CEO and a very close relationship with Microsoft." 
Gartenberg said the Motorola Mobility purchase gives Google the "opportunity to pursue their pure vision of 
Android," the mobile operating system it currently licenses to handset manufacturers around the world. 
"It shows they understand the importance of vertical integration, end-to-end hardware and software," Gartenberg 
said. "A lesson that Apple, RIM (Blackberry maker Research In Motion) and HP have already learned." 
Google has the resources to "shake up everyone else's business model if they so choose," he said. "Google can 
now undercut everyone if they choose in terms of premium handset pricing, go to the carriers with a different set 
of terms." 
Former Wall Street analyst Henry Blodget, editor-in-chief of the Business Insider website, was among those 
expressing doubt about the wisdom of the deal. 
He noted that it gives Google a much-needed portfolio of patents to protect Android from lawsuits but said it will 
be a "colossal disaster" unless Google "quickly sells off Motorola's hardware businesses." 
"Google is a massive global software company with huge profit margins, genius engineers, extraordinarily high 
pay scales and a near-monopoly on the most amazing advertising business the world has ever seen," Blodget 
wrote. "Motorola is a has-been, low-margin, global hardware-manufacturing business that operates at 
break-even." 
According to Blodget, "mergers of this size rarely work well (or smoothly), even when managed by companies that 
are very experienced at making huge acquisitions (which Google isn't)." 
Google's largest previous purchases were online advertising firm DoubleClick for $3.1 billion and YouTube for 
$1.65 billion.

"Google has no idea how to run a global hardware manufacturing business," Blodget continued. "The global 
hardware manufacturing business is so brutally tough that even companies that know how to run global hardware 
manufacturing businesses don't do it very well -- Exhibit A: Motorola." 
As for Wall Street, investors also appeared to be initially skeptical of the Motorola Mobility acquisition. 
Google shares lost 1.16 percent in New York on Monday and shed another 3.27 percent on Tuesday to close at 
$539.00. 
Standard & Poors, meanwhile, downgraded its opinion of Google shares on Tuesday to "sell" from "buy" saying 
the Motorola Mobility purchase poses a "risk to the company and stock." 
S&P said the acquisition could "negatively impact Google's growth, margins and balance sheet," and cut its 
12-month target price to $500 from $700.

Google's unexpected bid to buy cellphone maker Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion intensifies its rivalry with 
fellow tech titan Apple, as both companies battle for the lucrative smartphone market. 
The acquisition — Google's biggest ever — marks a departure for the search company, which has always given 
its popular Android software to phone makers but now will be able to build the devices itself. Even more crucial for 
Google, the Motorola purchase would give the company a giant trove of the most coveted commodity in the tech 
industry these days: patents. 
Motorola boasts more than 17,000 patents relating to wireless technology. That will expand Google's patent 
holdings by more than eight times as the company tries to play catch-up in a Cold War-like race among tech firms 
to build intellectual property arsenals — or risk destruction as they increasingly sue one another for idea theft. 
Having more patents means a company can make money by licensing technology to other companies, or a 
company can target rivals by either launching patent-based lawsuits or sitting on patents to ward off litigation. 
Google and its Android partners, including Motorola, Samsung and HTC, have been hit with multiple lawsuits 
alleging patent violations by Apple, Microsoft and Oracle. Google's rivals say stolen technology has powered 
Android's meteoric rise. 
But Google has argued that it is unfairly being ganged up on by companies intent on killing Android, which has 
quickly become the most popular operating system for smartphones. 
"Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Google's patent portfolio, which will enable 
us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies," wrote 
Google's chief executive and co-founder Larry Page on the company's official blog. 
Page and other Google officials sought to portray the company's purchase of Motorola as good for competition, 
especially since the search giant is under investigation by U.S. and European antitrust enforcers for unfairly 
hurting rivals. 
The Federal Trade Commission is already looking at broad worries about how Google leverages its dominance. 
As is typical for acquisitions of this size, the Motorola deal will also be reviewed separately by federal officials — 
most likely from the Department of Justice, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
Antitrust experts said the deal could be tough for officials to challenge because Google would be expanding into a 
new area, cellphone manufacturing. Courts typically are more worried about deals where a company acquires a 
firm with which it already competes head to head. 
Melissa Maxman, an antitrust attorney at Cozen O'Connor, said that if anything, antitrust enforcers might add 
restrictions on Google's behavior to protect Android partners such as Samsung from being treated unfairly now 
that Google will also be making its own phones with Android. Company officials said in a conference call with 
investors Monday morning that it will treat all its Android partners equally. 
Even though the acquisition seems to push Google into uncharted markets, it plays into the company's central 
strategy of getting as many people as possible to use its search engine, which generates ad revenue. With mobile 
technology becoming the fastest growing and most lucrative part of the industry, Google has used Android to 
plunge into the mobile search market. 
"There's tremendous opportunity here," Page said on a conference call with analysts Monday. "Android is growing 
like crazy."

But some analysts said the move to acquire Motorola might have been prompted by Google's loss earlier this 
year in a bidding war for the patent portfolio of Nortel Networks, a Canadian telecommunications equipment 
maker that had declared bankruptcy. After Google made a bid for the patents, a group of the company's rivals, 
including Microsoft and Apple, swooped in together to buy Nortel's 6,000 patents for $4.5billion. 
Motorola Mobility's patent portfolio is far bigger than Nortel's. Google has a much smaller portfolio — estimated 
to contain about 2,000 patents — compared with older tech firms. 
"They had no choice," said Alexander Poltorak, chief executive officer of General Patent Corp. "They had to 
acquire a large patent portfolio." 
Many experts think that the entire patent system is broken because of how easily the government approves even 
the most abstract ideas. 
"This is a good example of saying of how huge an impact the patent system and its broken form is having on the 
technology industry," said Ed Black, president and chief executive of the Computer and Communications Industry 
Association. "It's making multibillion-dollar deals necessary, and it's triggering lawsuits all over the place."

Google /Motorola Deal Under Review by Hill Short-Term Impact Uncertain 
Google/Motorola Deal Under Review by Hill Short-Term Impact Uncertain

Capitol Hill is reviewing Google's proposed $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility, aides to lawmakers told 
us. The FCC will review the deal, but only to a limited extent, an FCC official said. Motorola Mobility has a few 
spectrum licenses and will have to apply for license transfers. In the near-term, it's hard to see how the deal might 
affect small carriers as well as lobbying on the FCC's proposed AllVid rules, officials told us. Google has much to 
gain from Motorola's extensive patent portfolio, executives and analysts said. The companies are "confident" the 
deal, which would help protect the Android system from patent threats, will get approved by regulators in the U.S., 
Europe and possibly other jurisdictions, executives said during a conference call Monday announcing the deal. 
The House Judiciary Committee "just received notice of the proposal and [is] reviewing it," a Judiciary aide said. 
Similarly, a spokeswoman for Senate Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said staff "is just 
beginning to review the issue." A spokeswoman for the subcommittee's ranking member, Mike Lee, R-Utah, said 
the acquisition "is among many issues we look forward to discussing with [Google Chairman] Eric Schmidt at the 
subcommittee hearing next month." That hearing, which had already been planned, is titled "The Power of 
Google: Serving Consumers or Threatening Competition?" The deal is expected to be completed by early 2012. 
Expect Hill questions about what the vertical transaction means for search engines, handset manufacturers and 
OS makers that compete with Google and Motorola, a Senate aide said. Google is dominant in the search market 
and has been increasing its presence in the mobile space, the aide said. Review of the deal should include 
consideration of how important Android is for handset manufacturers and if Google's control of Motorola would 
result in more restrictive terms for other manufacturers, the aide said. 
Rep. Robert Dold, R-Ill., welcomed Google to his district, home of Motorola Mobility. "After reaching out to 
Google this morning, I'm pleased that Google intends to have Motorola Mobility retain its presence here in 
Illinois," he said. "While more must be done to spur job creation, it is welcoming news for the people of my district 
and the surrounding suburbs that Google is going to have a presence here." 
The deal is procompetitive and is not a horizontal transaction, Google Chief Legal Officer David Drummond said 
on the conference call. Android would drive innovation, competition and end-user choices, he said. One of Google 
CEO Larry Page's main messages on Monday's call was that the deal won't change how they run Android. "We 
will run Motorola as a separate business and provide separate reporting," Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette 
said. The acquisition should "mildly" add to earnings, once the deal closes, he said. Google still has plenty of 
financial flexibility to pursue future opportunities, he said. That could include the purchase of more patents, 
Drummond said. Google's Android partners, including Samsung, Sony Ericsson, HTC and LG Electronics, said in 
a statement the transaction shows Google's committed to "defending Android." 
The American Cable Association will review the deal to understand the impact on the cable set-top box market, 
"which has been a frustrating one for small cable operators long beholden to the Motorola-Cisco duopoly," CEO 
Matthew Polka said. For many cable operators, the question is whether Google's takeover of Motorola as one of 
only two major manufacturers will make things better or worse, he said. ACA members will want assurances from 
Google that it is committed to the cable business model and won't use its market power to run roughshod over 
smaller cable operators, he said. Additionally, "the future holds great promise for rural consumers as small cable 
operators explore IP- and cloud-based solutions in offering video to subscribers on TVs, PCs and mobile 
devices," he said. Prior to the deal announcement, Google has had its own interests in all of these areas and it 
will be important that Google's other business interests don't unduly harm the growth of these new competitive 
market opportunities, he said. 
It's difficult to draw conclusions about how the transaction might affect lobbying on the FCC's proposed AllVid 
rules, industry executives watching that proceeding said. Motorola and Google's policy goals on AllVid don't seem 
aligned. Motorola, one of the two major vendors of cable set-top boxes, has recently been quiet on AllVid. In its 
last meeting with FCC officials on the matter it discussed how "AllVid mandates would likely harm consumers,

Page 43 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
including those in low-income households," an ex parte notice filed April 14 shows. Google has been an advocate 
for AllVid rules as a member of the AllVid Tech Alliance. With the acquisition so fresh and the target clearly not 
the set-top business, it's doubtful either party has considered how it would affect their AllVid lobbying, industry 
executives said. The proceeding has effectively been on hold at the commission (WID Aug 1 p3). 
It's not certain Google would keep the set-top box and other Motorola businesses that affect cable and pay TV, 
said Executive Vice President Marc Sokol of NeuLion, an IPTV set-top box vendor. "It's too early to know how 
Google is going to rationalize the product portfolio within Motorola Mobility." Google may decide to shed some of 
those assets, said Robin Wilson, vice president of business development at Nagravision, a conditional access 
vendor. "If you look at all the acquisitions Google has done so far ... they tucked the companies in relatively well," 
he said. "This one is hugely different." The cultural differences between the companies are stark, Wilson said. "It's 
night and day, even in Silicon Valley, between going to a Motorola facility and Google." 
If Google was to keep Motorola's set-top box business, it could extend the Android operating system into the 
pay-TV environment, Sokol said. "Ultimately, the cost of those devices could go down if they're all running 
Android as opposed to some operating system from which more revenue is extracted." It could allow Android 
application developers access to new platforms and classes of hardware, he said. Google will probably soon 
clarify its intentions for the set-top and other businesses where Motorola Mobility operates, because it needs to 
reassure existing partners in those markets, said Rovi's chief evangelist Richard Bullwinkle. "They have to either 
say 'Yes, we're entering the hardware space,' or 'We're not coming after you,'" he said. "But if I were one of the 
manufacturers who has chosen Google's TV platform -- Sony, for example -- I would be looking for clarification 
right now." 
Google has much to gain from Motorola's extensive patent portfolio, composed of more than 17,000 patents and 
more than 7,500 pending applications. The boost to Google's patent holdings would provide a formidable line of 
defense for the Android operating system, which has been "under threat" from competitors, Drummond said on 
Monday's call. "We've been saying for some time that we intend to protect the Android ecosystem ... We think that 
combining with Motorola and having that kind of a patent portfolio ... to protect the ecosystem is a good thing." 
This year Google lost two high-profile patent bidding wars to competitors. In July ,Google's stalking-horse bid to 
purchase 6,000 patents from Nortel, a bankrupt Canadian manufacturer of telecom equipment, was trumped by a 
$4.5 billion deal offered by a consortium of Google's competitors: Apple, Microsoft, Research In Motion, Sony, 
EMC and Ericsson. Earlier this year, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle and EMC out-bid Google for 882 patents from 
software maker Novell, which they purchased for $442 million. Drummond claimed that Google's competitors 
were using the patent acquisitions to mount a coordinated effort to increase Android licensing fees for phone 
manufacturers, in a blog earlier this month (http://goo.gl/3H7U7). 
Though the Justice Department typically handles telecom deals, this one could fall under FTC scrutiny. If a 
transaction is greater than $66 million, the companies must file premerger papers with both the DOJ and FTC, 
who later decide which agency will process the request. A Justice spokeswoman told us it's too early to comment 
on the proposed deal as "the acquisition was only announced this morning." Justice has been eyeing the patent 
battle for what it called "antitrust concerns," and forced Apple, Microsoft, Oracle and EMC to change the terms of 
their Novell patent acquisition back in April. 
The FTC refused to comment on the proposed acquisition. The agency is currently investigating Google on 
antitrust violations related to its search and ad businesses. All Google services will be subject to third-party 
privacy audits pending the completion of the FTC's Google Buzz settlement (WID March 31 p3). 
Small carrier officials said it's too early to tell whether the deal is good or bad news from their standpoint. "I think 
the jury is still out on whether the Google purchase of Motorola Mobility will be a good thing or bad thing for 
small carriers that still have real problems getting access to devices," said Steve Berry, president of the Rural 
Cellular Association. "Google could abandon the concept of building OS Android phones for the new 4G ... or they 
could focus on exclusivity deals with the largest carriers" which "could freeze out the smaller carriers," he said. 
But an executive with one competitive carrier said the deal could mean more competition. "This has the potential 
to reduce AT&T's and Verizon's near-complete control over the device market," the official. "Apple has shown that 
you can sell a device to consumers separate from a carrier. Google is one of the only other players in the industry 
with the power to do the same thing, but it lacked the hardware until now. If Google gets serious about the device 
business, it can be a disruptive force in today's virtually closed market for devices." 
At the $12.5 billion price tag, the deal represents the largest acquisition ever by Google, analyst firm Collins 
Steward said. The deal emphasizes the "tremendous future monetization potential of Android, as well as Google's 
huge bet on mobile," it said. Some Android partners are becoming increasingly annoyed with "Google's growing 
world domination," said Stela Bokun with Pyramid Research. As for Android partners among handset makers, the

deal "might not be so good for them in medium to long term," he said. Meanwhile, Google's ratings are unaffected 
by the deal, Standard & Poor's said. -- Yu-Ting Wang, Bryce Baschuk, Howard Buskirk, Adam Bender, Josh Wein

India, Aug. 16 -- I think Larry Page and Google co-founder Sergey Brin are paying most of the $12.5 billion they 
are for Motorola's Mobility's 17,000 patents. That's 28x of what Google had so far. Several thousand more are in 
the pipeline. 
Patent power is Page's bid to stave off unending infringement cases that he, the new CEO for 
four-and-a-half-months, faces around his Android platform. Once the acquisition is through, Page can assist 
handset partners like HTC and Samsung, who have recently seen many lawsuits while using his Android 
operating system. Apple has claimed that Android partners have violated its patents. 
Not surprisingly, Page denies patents are the reason. In fact, just to keep the regulators off his back, he has 
hinted that Motorola Holdings will remain a separate company. But to get their buck's bang, Brin and Page are 
sure to integrate the two entities as closely as possible. 
Then there'll be a closer integration with Motorola's slew of handset products. As the acquisition is completed, 
Page and Brin will finally have a handset manufacturer to better compete with Apple. 
Surely, Apple's Steve Jobs will fight hard to stop this from happening easily. But for now, Page has pulled off the 
right boost that the Android platform needed. 
Those worried, if not publicly, include Samsung and HTC too. While Page is busy assuring that he isn't going to 
twist the knife on them just for the sake of Motorola, that can happen sooner than later. For now, Samsung and 
HTC have their own selfish interests for supporting the acquisition. 
All said, we'll hear a lot more of the Android platform. That's because Microsoft shareholders would push for some 
action too. The company is under pressure to loosen its purse strings and buy Finnish partner, Nokia. The target 
company's shares are soaring soon after Page's acquisition. The idea seems misplaced. 
This is equally true for arguments that Page and Apple's Steve Jobs may also try to acquire Nokia. Jobs has 
around 4,000 patents. This may seem like good news for those who patiently held on to their Nokia stock, but I 
think that a buyout isn't happening soon! 
Nokia already has a partnership with Microsoft and certainly Microsoft may be the most tempted to be purchasing 
the company. But the present excitement could be shortlived. Nokia is already trading at a market cap of over $24 
billion. Does it have enough patent power to excite Microsoft, which unlike Google, has a huge patent reservoir of 
its own? I doubt that. 
Research in Motion, your friendly Blackberry maker, is another company who saw large gains, for the same 
reasons as Nokia. But while I own a Torch myself, I empathise with the argument that RIM is a dying product with 
lots of patents and a a load of cash. 
Page's acquisition is simply his way of "catching up" to the competition on a long term basis. The biggest threat 
before him is that the proposed deal will increase government scrutiny. The particular focus is on Page's abuse of 
power to stifle competition. The inquiries include Google's internet search and advertising businesses. Regulators 
are also keen to know if Page is using Android to ensure its services receive preferential treatment on devices 
using that free software. 
The men enjoying this the most are the folks at Motorola. Motorola Mobility CEO Sanjay Jha and the company's 
largest shareholder, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who had been pressuring Jha to cash in on the patent 
portfolio. Motorola has been struggling on the product side for years. In one day, its stock is up 57 per cent. 
Patents pay, and how!

Why Google had to have Motorola Mobility

Dan Gillmor: The acquisition has provoked comment about defensive buying of patents, but Google surely has 
more ambition than that 
For several years now, Google has been following a vow made by former CEO Eric Schmidt: mobile first. New 
CEO Larry Page is taking that dictum to a new level by announcing a deal to buy Motorola Mobility for $12.5bn. 
The implications of this deal depend entirely on how Google plans to use Motorola. If, as some claim, the deal is 
more about obtaining Motorola's mobile patent portfolio than anything else, we can expect escalating patent 
warfare between technology giants and limited innovation beyond that. If, however, Google intends to operate the 
business it is acquiring, we may see some broad and sweeping changes in the technology industry. 
If the deal is chiefly about obtaining Motorola's mobile patent portfolio, then Google would likely spin off the 
hardware end of the company and keep the software and patents. The patents would be vital weapons in its 
competition with Apple and Microsoft, as the two companies are using patent claims to try to slow the remarkable 
growth of Google's Android operating system, which has become the most widely used smartphone platform. 
But assuming Google intends to operate the business it is purchasing – and also assuming, as seems probable, 
regulatory approval of the deal – the landscape for Google, and the technology industry more broadly, will 
change. Some of the implications are clear already. 
Perhaps Google wants to be more like Apple, owning an entire ecosystem around Android. For all its success, 
Android has suffered from "feature balkanisation", as phone manufacturers and carriers have turned the open 
source system to their own aims. 
Motorola knows how to make good hardware (though it's been outdone in that regard by Samsung and HTC in 
the Android market), and one can imagine some excellent devices – once Google controls the outcome, as it did 
with its initial Nexus One phone (made by HTC) and Nexus S (Samsung). 
Such devices should include tablets, which have been a notably dry area so far for Google and its Honeycomb 
operating system (effectively, an advanced Android OS). To date, Android tablets, including Motorola's Xoom, 
have made very few inroads in an arena heavily dominated by Apple. That may change with an Amazon tablet 
this fall, but Google needs to create its own to showcase what is possible. 
In the near term, it is difficult to imagine any competitor fully matching Apple's ability to marry hardware and 
software with elegance and ease of use. Where Google could beat Apple, however, is by being less controlling of 
users than Apple has become: one reason many people (including me) have chosen Android is a preference to 
make more of our own decisions about how we want our devices to work. 
To the extent that Google uses Motorola to develop and launch superb devices, it will be competing directly with 
its partners. The company claims that the deal will not affect its relations with other Android handset makers, but 
that strikes me as fantasy. A cascade of happy talk in amusingly similar, supportive statements from Samsung, 
HTC, etc on Monday can't disguise the reality that they should be weighing their options with renewed urgency. I 
don't see why they should trust Google, at this point. 
So, who should be happy about this deal? Microsoft, among others. The Google-Motorola deal gives the 
Windows mobile platform a renewed lease on life. Microsoft could now position itself as the only major operating 
system that is platform-agnostic. That neutrality is somewhat suspect given Microsoft's recent alliance with Nokia,

Page 48 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
which includes a major investment and all kinds of special treatment, but it will be in Microsoft's interest to be as 
neutral as possible in dealings with its mobile partners. 
Another, less obvious dimension of this deal is that it may help Google make enormous strides in the television 
marketplace. Google has been trying, with limited success, to push Android into living rooms via Google TV. 
Given that Motorola makes set-top boxes, Google TV could become part of this market. But the other cable and 
satellite companies will have a lot to say about this – and they already consider Google a scary competitor, not a 
partner. 
The most widely discussed element of the deal – the patents – highlights one of the technology industry's worst 
problems. As Chicago Public Radio's This American Life recently reported, America's patent system is highly 
dysfunctional. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) routinely issues patents for "obvious 
non-inventions", many of which have already been invented. This enables patent "trolls" to extort settlements from 
companies allegedly violating those patents; this is, in effect, a tax on technology and a severe impediment to 
actual innovation. Meanwhile, several federal district courts – notably one in Texas – have become havens for the 
the patent trolls, further tilting the scales in favour of plaintiffs. And Congress, as usual, has refused to do its job. 
Among other acts of malfeasance, Congress has refused to give the USPTO the funding it needs to do the job 
properly, in part by appropriating the fees the agency collects from applicants in order to fund other programmes. 
A patent "reform" bill now under consideration and all too likely to become law would, by any reasonable analysis, 
make matters even worse. 
To the extent that the Google-Motorola deal is defensive, a buying of weaponry in the ever-escalating patent 
warfare, it can hardly be called productive. But I hope it's about much more than that, namely Google's intention 
to push harder in the mobile arena to open it up to more competition.

WALL STREET 
Motorola Mobility shares soared after Google bid $12.5bn to buy the handset group , helping to extend a rally in 
US shares from the end of last week. 
Mobility's shares were up 56 per cent to $38.24, catching up to the $40-a-share price that Google offered. 
That was a 63 per cent premium to the company's closing price on Friday. 
Google's shares slipped 2.6 per cent to $557.83, reflecting some of the risks of the all-cash deal at a time of 
intense competition in the mobile market. 
Analysts at Stifel Nicolaus lowered their price target on Google shares to $675 from $690, though analysts at 
Oppenheimer and Piper Jaffray maintained their targets at $690 and $750, respectively. 
A main motivation was to secure some of Motorola's patents and "protect the Android eco-system", said Stuart 
Jeffrey, analyst at Nomura. 
Larry Page, Google's chief executive, stressed that the Android platform would remain open to competing 
handset makers, such as Samsung , Nokia and HTC . Android has been slowed by competitive concerns in 
Europe where some groups have claimed competing licences. 
Shares in Oracle , one software company with which Google is locked in a dispute over licences, fell 0.4 per cent 
to $27.30. 
Analysts said the deal could boost some competitors. "Anything that slows Android momentum helps RIM and 
Nokia," said Mike Walkley, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. "Carriers are frightened of a choice of two carriers 
globally and, given that Google is now buying a handset-maker, they're even more likely to support a competing 
platform like Microsoft's." 
Shares in Microsoft added 0.8 per cent to $25.30 while US-listed shares of Research in Motion , maker of the 
BlackBerry, added 4 per cent to $25.55. 
Apple , maker of the competing iPhone and iPad products, was up 1.2 per cent to $381.60. Hewlett-Packard , 
which recently released its own tablet operating system, was up 0.3 per cent to $32.41. 
The broader S&P 500 index was up 1.2 per cent to 1,193.20 at midday, seeking its third one-day gain in a row for 
the first time since the beginning of July. 
It has nearly erased its losses from last week, down just 0.5 per cent, despite opening last week with a 7 per cent 
drop. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.1 per cent to 11,389.05 and the Nasdaq Composite index was higher 
by 0.7 per cent at 11,389.05.

Page 50 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
However, there was concern that the rally might not last. Volumes in US equities were their lowest by midday 
since before the US debt ceiling deal was agreed and well behind the record volumes seen as the market 
declined last week. 
The release of the Empire State manufacturing survey, a leading indicator of New York-region factory activity, 
showed shrinking activity for the third month in a row. 
"Whether this is a hardened bottom, or just a technical bounce on the way to lower levels depends on macro 
indicators," said Myles Zyblock, institutional strategist at RBC Capital Markets. 
Utilities, one of RBC's defensive recommendations, led all sectors in the S&P 500, up 3.2 per cent. 
Financials were 2.5 per cent higher, reversing some of their 5 per cent decline last week, the most of any sector. 
Bank of America shares were up 5.8 per cent to $7.61 after the bank said it was selling a Canadian credit card 
unit to Toronto-Dominion for $8.6bn. 
Shares in Transocean , the offshore drilling group that has bid $1.4bn for a Norwegian competitor , advanced 2.5 
per cent to $56.99. 
Lowe's , the home repair retailer, fell 0.8 per cent to $19.36 in spite of earnings for the quarter topping 
expectations, at 68 cents a share versus the 66 cents expected. 
However, US homebuilder confidence remained near its historic lows, unchanged in August versus July. 
Disappointing earnings led Estée Lauder , the cosmetics group, lower by 7.2 per cent, to $93.63. Earnings were 
24 cents versus the 24.9 cents expected. 
Analysts at Barclays Capital lowered their price targets on soft-line retailers, citing falling consumer demand amid 
an economic pullback and still-high input costs. 
Time Warner Cable dropped 1.2 to $64.71 after it said it had sealed its acquisition of Insight , a regional US cable 
television provider, for $3bn in cash. 
Interpublic Group , the advertising and marketing group, rose 1.5 per cent to $8.77 after it said it was selling a 
stake in Facebook to fund a share buy-back.

GOOGLE stepped up its assault on the smartphone and tablet computer market with the £7.7bn acquisition of 
handset maker Motorola. 
The search engine group is to pay $12.5bn for Motorola Mobility in a deal which gives it direct control over one 
of the largest manufacturers of mobile phones running Android, Google’s own operating system. 
The price, a 63 per cent premium to the value of Motorola Mobility at the end of last week, makes the deal the 
largest ever undertaken by the California-based company and was hailed by Google chief executive Larry Page 
as a ‘natural fit’. 
Motorola Mobility is already a partner of Google, but will remain as a separate business and licensee of Android, 
which will also remain an open platform. Shares in Motorola Mobility soared on news of the deal, which comes 
just eight months after the former Motorola split into two companies – Mobility, the handset company, and 
Solutions that supplies wireless services to business and governments. 
Google expects the purchase to complete by the end of 2011 or early 2012.

Google to acquire US mobile company's smartphone business to 'supercharge the Android ecosystem'. By Josh 
Halliday 
Google is to acquire Motorola Mobility, the US mobile company's smartphone business, in a $12.5bn (£7.6bn) 
cash deal. 
The takeover will boost Google's increasing dominance in the nascent smartphone and tablet computer market. 
The $40 a share deal is a 63% premium on Motorola Mobility's closing price on the New York Stock Exchange 
on Friday. 
Larry Page, Google chief executive, said: "Motorola Mobility's total commitment to Android has created a 
natural fit for our two companies. Together, we will create amazing user experiences that supercharge the entire 
Android ecosystem for the benefit of consumers, partners and developers. I look forward to welcoming 
Motorolans to our family of Googlers." 
Sanjay Jha, chief executive of Motorola Mobility, added: "This transaction offers significant value for Motorola 
Mobility's stockholders and provides compelling new opportunities for our employees, customers, and partners 
around the world. 
"We have shared a productive partnership with Google to advance the Android platform, and now through this 
combination we will be able to do even more to innovate and deliver outstanding mobility solutions across our 
mobile devices and home businesses." 
The deal represents Google's biggest challenge yet to Apple, which has led the way in the smartphone and tablet 
markets with the iPhone and iPad. 
Other manufacturers, including Samsung and HTC, will be free to release phones using Google's Android 
software. Google will run Motorola Mobility as a separate business. 
The takeover also pits Google, which has traditionally avoided involvement in hardware, against the 
manufacturing giant Nokia. The move comes just six months after the Finnish phone maker signed a strategic 
deal with Microsoft in an effort to rebuild its ailing fortunes. 
Motorola was the first mobile maker to partner with Google and release phones based on its Android operating 
system. 
Motorola spun off Mobility as a separate business in January this year. The manufacturing division primarily 
produces smartphones, such as the Motorola Droid and the Defy, but also makes tablet computers and digital 
set-top boxes. 
Analysts have long predicted that half of the world's smartphones will be using Android software by the end of 
2012, as manufacturers have rushed to adopt Google's operating system rather than develop their own. 
The deal is subject to US regulatory approval, which could prove a larger hurdle than usual given that Google's 
Android division is already being probed by anti-trust investigators. The companies said they expect the takeover 
to be completed in late 2011 or early 2012.

Andy Rubin, senior vice president of mobile at Google, said: "We expect that this combination will enable us to 
break new ground for the Android ecosystem. 
"However, our vision for Android is unchanged and Google remains firmly committed to Android as an open 
platform and a vibrant open source community. We will continue to work with all of our valued Android partners to 
develop and distribute innovative Android-powered devices."

Google 's Motorola play is all about the patents

TECHNOLOGY REPORTER 
Google Inc. is writing the biggest cheque in company history to save its Android operating system from a slow, 
litigious death. 
The Web search giant, which earlier this summer lost a high-stakes battle for Nortel's 6,000-patent portfolio to 
rivals Apple, Microsoft and Research In Motion, will purchase handset manufacturer Motorola Mobility for 
$12.5-billion (U.S.). The acquisition target's primary asset? An arsenal of 17,000 existing and 7,500 pending 
patents. 
“It's a huge deal,” said technology and intellectual property lawyer Arshia Tabrizi. 
“Everyone thought Google was dead in the water after their Nortel bid fell through. But it turns out they had a very 
nice plan B.” 
Google's big bet appears to be one of necessity. 
The company's Android operating system, which powers 150 million mobile devices from almost 40 different 
manufacturers, is the subject of hundreds of patent infringement cases worldwide. Increasingly, those cases 
aren't going Google's way, raising the prospect that the company's most successful product since its core search 
engine may be wiped out from many, if not all, major markets. 
Last week, Apple persuaded a German court to ban new shipments of Samsung's Android-powered Galaxy tablet 
throughout much of the continent, potentially crippling future sales. 
Apple alone is involved in dozens of similar cases against HTC and Motorola, the vast majority being 
Android-related patent infringement claims. Microsoft is also involved in legal action against Android 
device-makers. Additionally, Google and Oracle are locked in a court case of their own. 
For years, Google has chosen to protect its innovations using trade secrets rather than patents. But in the past 
couple of years, firms have decided to lean on legal action in such cases, where Google's trade secrets are less 
effective because infringement in those cases requires that the offending company willingly obtain and copy the 
trade secret. Patents, however, can be infringed upon even if the offending firm develops the same technology 
without ever having heard of the patented innovation. 
With Motorola Mobility's patent chest – which includes many key pieces of intellectual property dating back 
almost 80 years – Google now has a means of settling at least some of the cases against Android by offering to 
license some of its own patents. 
“This is by and large a defensive play,” Mr. Tabrizi said. “Now Google can look at cross-licensing, so when Apple 
comes after them they can say, ‘Well, you're infringing on this, this and this.'” The extent of Google's concern 
about its patent vulnerability is readily apparent. In a note announcing the proposed Motorola Mobility 
acquisition, Google CEO Larry Page accused rivals such as Microsoft and Apple of “banding together in 
anti-competitive patent attacks on Android.

Page 55 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
“Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Google's patent portfolio, which will enable 
us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies.” 
Last month, after losing the Nortel auction, Google quietly bought a suite of more than 1,000 patents from IBM. 
Although the price tag was not disclosed, it is likely that, between the IBM deal, the Nortel auction and the 
Motorola Mobility acquisition, three of the biggest deals in the technology world this year have revolved around 
the transfer of lawsuit bargaining chips. 
Indeed, for weeks investors had speculated that Google would next make a run at patent-holding firm InterDigital, 
according to Frost & Sullivan analyst Ronald Gruia. Following today's acquisition news, however, InterDigital 
shares plummeted more than 14 per cent on the Nasdaq. 
RIM shares, on the other hand, jumped nearly 10 per cent on Monday, closing at $26.59 (Canadian) on the 
Toronto Stock Exchange, at least partially as a result of speculation that the Motorola Mobility purchase may 
push Microsoft to make an acquisition of its own. 
“Whenever something like this happens,” Mr. Gruia said, “it makes you think, ‘Okay, who's next?'” 
***** 
WHAT'S AT STAKE 
The fee 
The $12.5-billion (U.S.) deal values Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. at $40 per share in cash, a 63-per-cent 
premium to its closing price Friday. 
The terms of the deal also feature an unusually rich reverse breakup fee of $2.5-billion, or 20 per cent of the 
price, if Google cancels the deal. 
The risks 
Google, a software maker, would be thrust into a manufacturing role, running factories and dealing with suppliers 
and inventories. With the purchase of a handset maker, Google also runs the risk of becoming a competitor to the 
customers who buy its Android phone operating system. 
The market leader 
Google's Android became the number one smart phone operating system last fall, surpassing Apple and Nokia. 
Google says more than 150 million Android devices have been activated worldwide since the launch of the first 
handset in 2008, and that 550,000 devices are being activated every day.

SEOUL (Dow Jones)--Google Inc.'s (GOOG) move to acquire Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) is aimed at 
protecting the intellectual property of the Android software platform, Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE) said 
Tuesday. 
"Samsung Electronics welcomes Google's proposed acquisition of Motorola, which is aimed at protecting the 
patents owned by the Android camp," Samsung's spokesman Kevin Kim said. 
"The acquisition won't affect Samsung's mobile business." 
J.K. Shin, president of Samsung's mobile communications division, has sent a message to Google Chief 
Executive Larry Page saying the Korean company welcomes the deal as it "demonstrates Google's deep 
commitment (to the Android operating system)," Kim said. 
Google, which has spurred widespread adoption of its Android mobile operating system by licensing it for free to 
mobile phone manufacturers, Monday said it agreed to acquire Motorola for about $12.5 billion.

Google Deal Shakes Up Asia's Mobile Landscape 
Google Deal Shakes Up Asia's Mobile Landscape

Google Inc.'s move to acquire Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. sets up a competitive landscape with the Asian 
companies that -- aside from Motorola -- have become the biggest producers of smartphones using its Android 
operating system, including HTC Corp., Samsung Electronics Co., LG Electronics Inc. and Huawei Technologies 
Co. 
Taiwan-based HTC, once a little-known contract manufacturer of handsets, has in recent years become one of 
the world's top smartphone vendors by creating popular Android devices like the Evo and Thunderbolt. In the 
second quarter, the company had 11% share of smartphone shipments globally, up from 6.8% a year earlier, 
according to research firm IDC. 
Samsung and LG of South Korea and Sony Ericsson, the Japanese-Swedish joint venture between Sony Corp. 
and Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, have also pushed heavily into Android devices. 
And Huawei and ZTE Corp., both Chinese telecom-equipment makers that have made aggressive pushes in 
handset manufacturing, are gaining in the burgeoning market for smartphones costing under $200. 
Google sought to allay concerns about how the acquisition might affect those companies, with CEO Larry Page 
saying on the company's blog that the deal "will not change our commitment to run Android as an open platform" 
and that Google will run Motorola as a separate business. "Many hardware partners have contributed to Android's 
success and we look forward to continuing to work with all of them to deliver outstanding user experiences," Mr. 
Page said. 
An HTC spokeswoman said the company supports the deal, which "is a positive development to the Android 
ecosystem, which we believe is beneficial to HTC's promotion of Android phones." 
Samsung, LG and Huawei declined immediate comment. Sony Ericsson and ZTE didn't respond to requests to 
comment. 
Google faces potential challenges managing Motorola Mobility's China business, which analysts say is one of 
the company's key growth areas. Motorola Mobility has gone to great lengths to boost its China presence, 
including the production of several handsets designed only for Chinese users, with handwriting input and 
dual-SIM card capabilities, the small chips allowing access to mobile networks. 
Following a public spat with the Chinese government last year over censorship requirements and cyberattacks, 
Google moved its Chinese-language search services to Hong Kong and has been phasing out some of its key 
partnerships in the country. 
Access to key Google services, including Web search and Gmail, has become unstable, and makers of Android 
phones -- including Motorola Mobility -- have replaced Google services on their devices with services from rivals 
like Baidu Inc. and Microsoft Corp. for Chinese users. 
Chinese officials couldn't be reached to comment. 
Authorities have wide influence over both the Internet and the mobile-device industry in China, the world's biggest 
market by users in both categories. Motorola Mobility and other handset vendors must meet special 
requirements, including over wireless Internet technology, to have their products approved for sale in China, the

In a bid to strengthen its mobile business, Google announced on Monday that it would acquire Motorola Mobility 
Holdings, the cellphone business that was split from Motorola, for $40 a share in cash, or $12.5 billion. 
The offer — by far Google's largest ever for an acquisition — is 63 per cent above the closing price of Motorola 
Mobility shares on Friday. Motorola manufactures phones that run on Google's Android software. 
Android has become an increasingly important platform for Google, as global smartphone adoption accelerates. 
The platform, launched in 2007, is now used in more than 150 million devices, with 39 manufacturers. The 
acquisition would turn Google, which makes the Android mobile operating system, into a full-fledged cellphone 
manufacturer, in direct competition with Apple. The deal answers a big question about Google's next strategic 
step in wireless. Google has been battling with Apple and Microsoft over patents. 
Last month, Apple and Microsoft led a consortium of technology companies in a $4.5 billion purchase of roughly 
6,000 patents from Nortel Networks, the Canadian telecommunications maker that filed for bankruptcy in 2008. 
Google, which lost out in the bidding, criticised the deal as an anticompetitive strategy. Several weeks later, 
Google acquired more than 1,000 patents from IBM. 
Motorola holds more than 17,000 patents. 
While the acquisition will move Google directly into the telecommunications hardware business, Larry Page, 
Google's chief executive, said in a blog post that "this acquisition will not change our commitment to run Android 
as an open platform. Motorola will remain a licensee of Android and Android will remain open. We will run 
Motorola as a separate business." 
Still, the deal is certain to attract significant antitrust scrutiny. The Federal Trade Commission is already 
investigating Google's dominance in several areas of its business. The company has agreed to pay a $2.5 billion 
reverse termination fee, if it walks away, and Motorola will pay a $375 million break-up fee if it takes another offer, 
according to a person close to the transaction, who was not authorised to speak. 
In a conference call on Monday morning, Google said it was confident that it will be able to win regulatory 
approval, since the deal will ultimately improve competition in the smart phone market. 
"We think this is a competitive transaction," David Drummond, the company's chief legal officer said. "This is not a 
horizontal transaction, Google has not materially been in the handset business." 
On the company's official blog, Page said Google was purchasing the handset maker to bolster its Android mobile 
operating system and increase the number of patents it owned. 
The acquisition has been approved by both boards.

Google and Motorola Mobilityannounced they’re joining forces in a $12.5 billion deal that could have a whole lot 
of impact on the tech industry. Apart from patent issues we addressed earlier, here are some things to consider 
about the deal and why it does (and doesn't) make sense: 
Google enters hardware: Google doesn't foresee any sort of regulation trouble on the horizon regarding this 
particular deal, because it’s a vertical acquisition.Google isn't currently a player in the manufacturer game, so this 
deal probably won't trigger too many alarm bells at the Federal Trade Commission over what it's doing in the 
mobile space. 
In some ways, the company is catching up — Apple does its own hardware and software, HP has WebOS 
through its Palm acquisition, and Microsoft is quite cozy with Nokia. 
That said, Arik Hesseldahl wrote at All Things Digital that it's possible that Microsoft will make some noise about 
the acquisition, given its public spat with Google over patents and its ongoing rivalry between Bing and Google. 
Android's open...right?: Okay, but what if you're Samsung, HTC or LG? The manufacturers may be saying — 
even if it is in a somewhat cookie-cutter fashion — that they're happy about the acquisition, but there has got to 
be some anxiety on their part that Motorola will now be Google's favored company. 
Google CEO Larry Page and mobile lead Andy Rubin both said multiple times during the conference call 
announcing the deal that they are committed to Android's open platform, and that it wouldn't make sense to 
restrict it to just one manufacturer. 
The acquisition also raises questions about what exactly is going to happen to the Nexus line, Google's only foray 
into manufacturing. HTC and Samsung have both taken a crack at making the phone to house the bleeding-edge 
of Android innovation for Google. Will Motorola now get preferential treatment? 
Competing with Apple: Cupertino looms over this deal like some sort of brushed-aluminum specter, as this is a 
clear move to set up an all-out mobile war between iOS and Android. 
It's easy to see this move as an attempt to curb the fragmentation of the Android platform and give Google a 
firmer hold over its open-source superstar. Will that help it compete with Apple? 
It really depends on how the Android really shakes out post-acquisition, but if Google does end up stepping on 
the toes of partners such as Samsung and HTC, it may encourage them to jump to Microsoft. 
It's obviously too early to tell, but investors don't seem so sure about Android's chances— Google is down in 
trading today, while Apple continues to grow with the rest of tech stocks. 
Google TV: Motorola is a leading set-top box manufacturer, meaning that this acquisition could spell good things 
for getting Google TV into more living rooms across the country. 
In this morning's conference call, Page and Motorola CEO Sanjay Jha said that they hope this partnership will 
spur further innovation when it comes to set-top boxes. With Motorola's network of cable contacts, Google's got a 
real opportunity to expand in this area.

This post has been updated since it was originally posted: 
In Google's largest acquisition to date, the company announced Monday that it hasagreed to acquire Motorola 
Mobility. The $12.5 billion deal is expected to help the company bolster its leading Android platform. 
Motorola Mobility, which spun off from Motorola in January 2011, is the maker of several of the most prominent 
handsets for Google's Android platform, including the Droid series of smartphones. 
"The combination of Google and Motorola will not only supercharge Android, but will also enhance competition 
and offer consumers accelerating innovation, greater choice, and wonderful user experiences," said Google chief 
executive Larry Page in a company blog post Monday. "I am confident that these great experiences will create 
huge value for shareholders." 
The deal will give Google control of Motorola's impressive portfolio of patents — something the company needs to 
fend off intellectual property lawsuits. The search giant has been aggressively pursuing patents for its mobile 
division, and recently acquired more than 1,000 from IBM.Google recently lost its bid for patents from bankrupt 
Canadian tech company Nortel to a consortium of the search company's largest mobile phone rivals including 
Apple, Microsoft and Research in Motion. The Department of Justice is looking into the deal, which raised 
antitrust concerns. 
"Why is the portfolio worth five times more to this group collectively than it is to Google?" said Robert Skitol, an 
antitrust lawyer at the Drinker Biddle firm to The Washington Post in July. "Why are three horizontal competitors 
being allowed to collaborate and cooperate and join hands together in this, rather than competing against each 
other?" 
Google's chief legal officer, David Drummond said on a conference call that he does not expect there to be any 
antitrust concerns about the Motorola acquisition. While Google has hardware agreements with HTC and 
Samsung for its Nexus phones, the company does not own a device manufacturer. 
"We believe strongly that this is pro-competitive transaction," Drummond said in a conference call. "Android has 
clearly added competition and innovation and increased user choice," he said. "Protecting that is pro-competition, 
almost by definition." 
Google said that it will run Motorola Mobility as a separate division, and Page, Drummond and Google's mobile 
head Andy Rubin stressed repeatedly during the call that this will not affect the openness of its Android platform. 
"We expect that this combination will enable us to break new ground for the Android ecosystem," said Andy Rubin, 
head of Google's mobile division in a statement. "However, our vision for Android is unchanged and Google 
remains firmly committed to Android as an open platform and a vibrant open source community. We will continue 
to work with all of our valued Android partners to develop and distribute innovative Android-powered devices." 
The companies expect to complete the deal by early 2012, pending approval from stockholders and regulatory 
agencies in the U.S. and Europe.

Why Google Is Spending $12.5 Billion to Acquire Motorola Mobility

NEW YORK – Google’s $12.5 billion agreement to acquire Motorola Mobility may not only make it a key mobile 
handset player and boost its Android mobile operating system, but could also benefit the Internet giant’s Google 
TV service. 
“Google gains a possibly more effective route into the home thanks to Motorola's set-top box business, which 
could provide a boost for Google TV,” said Noah Elkin, principal analyst at digital media research firm eMarketer. 
The Google TV software platforms allows TV sets and set-top boxes to access online video, but it has so far not 
taken off as much as Google would have liked. Given that Motorola is one of the biggest cable set-top-box 
makers, the deal could benefit the service. 
Barclays Capital pay TV analyst James Ratcliffe said Google could via the deal also become a "potential source 
of set-to-box innovation" for pay TV operators. "Within the major cable [TV distributors], Comcast has the most 
proportional exposure to Motorola set-top-boxes, which are also the primary platforms for Verizon FiOS and 
AT&T U-Verse." 
He predicted that pay TV providers "are likely to view this acquisition warily as an emerging competitor (Google 
Video/YouTube) now becomes a key vendor." On the positive side, "this transaction could accelerate integration 
of Internet capability into cable set-top-boxes," concluded Ratcliffe. 
Still, Google was mainly focused on other objectives in striking the Motorola deal, particularly the future of the 
Android platform and securing patents that it will can use as technology firms increasingly fight over intellectual 
property, according to observers. 
“Google is paying a significant premium to intrinsic value of Motorola Mobility, because there are few broad 
patent portfolios available in the marketplace today, and Motorola Mobility has one of the largest,” said RBC 
Capital Markets analyst Ross Sandler. “Google (via Android) and the various Android original equipment 
manufacturers are likely facing significant risk of licensing fees and lawsuits around the intellectual property used 
to build Android from Oracle, Apple, Microsoft and others.” 
He argued that the likely outcome of all of such lawsuits would be licensing agreements among the Android 
original equipment manufacturers, “and with this acquisition Google vaults itself to the top of the food chain in 
terms of intellectual property and removes some of those future expenses,” Sandler explained. 
Others echoed those views. Barclays Capital analyst Anthony DiClemente said that the acquisition of Motorola 
Mobility will give Google ownership of 17,000-plus approved and 7,500 pending patents. “Android has significant 
momentum, and as the Web increasingly shifts to mobile, we believe Google must protect its Android franchise, 
which is seeing over 550,000 daily device activations and has sold over 150 million devices.” 
Added Elkin: "Buying a handset maker, in theory, gives Google the same degree of control over the Android 
ecosystem that Apple enjoys with iOS.” 
However, Google “may also end up altering the balance with its hardware partners, making it challenging for 
Google to continue positioning Android as a truly open platform,” he added. 
Google CEO Larry Page on Monday highlighted the importance of the deal, saying it will “super-charge” Android. 
Google's Android has a growing share of the smartphones market, which will hit 28 percent this year, up from 24 
percent in 2010 and just 6% in 2009, according to eMarketer. Apple's share is expected to grow to 30 percent this

year from 28 percent in 2010, according to its estimates. 
In 2012, emarketer sees Android running on 31 percent of all smartphones, while Apple will hold steady at 30 
percent.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SUMMARY

Page 72 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Ben Schachter, Macquarie. 
BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE SECURITIES: The first question I have is specifically for David. I 
was wondering if you could help us understand really of the broad legal ramifications of the patent portfolio both 
before the deal closes and post the deal closing in terms of how it changes your legal strategy around how you're 
dealing with all the lawsuits. And then Patrick, (technical difficulty). 
OPERATOR: Pardon the interruption; we'll go to our next question. Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse. 
SPENCER WANG, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thanks, good morning. I guess my first question is similar to 
Ben's which is can we just get an overview of the Motorola patent portfolio? Our understanding is that there's over 
15,000 patents with another 7,500 pending. And then secondly for Patrick, our understanding is that there is a 
deferred tax asset at Motorola. Is this something that would -- that you would be able to utilize upon acquisition? 
Thank you. 
LARRY PAGE, CEO, GOOGLE INC.: Let's have David address the patent question. 
PATRICK PICHETTE, SVP & CFO, GOOGLE INC.: Hello, can you hear us, Amy? 
OPERATOR: I can hear you, sir. 
PATRICK PICHETTE: For some reason the calls are dropping. Why don't we actually answer -- can people hear 
us, Amy? 
OPERATOR: Yes, people should be able to hear you just fine. Right now Spencer. 
PATRICK PICHETTE: So why don't we actually answer the question on the -- the first two questions that we 
heard which were about the patents and then I'll cover the tax. 
OPERATOR: Please proceed, sir. 
PATRICK PICHETTE: David. 
DAVID DRUMMOND, SVP, CORP. DEVELOPMENT & CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER, GOOGLE INC.: Sorry about 
that. So just answering the first -- going back to the first question from Ben. Look, we -- the patent -- I'll let Sanjay 
speak to the existing Motorola patent portfolio. We've been saying for some time that we intend to protect the 
Android ecosystem; it's under threat from some companies who are looking to use patents (technical difficulty). 
And so I think while I'm not prepared to talk about specific strategies, we think that combining with Motorola and 
having that kind of a patent portfolio, which Sanjay can talk about in a moment, to protect the ecosystem is a 
good thing. 
SANJAY JHA, CHAIRMAN & CEO, MOTOROLA MOBILITY HOLDINGS, INC.: Thanks, David. Just talking about 
the patent portfolio that we have here at Motorola Mobility, we have over 17,000 issued patents worldwide, we 
have on top of that over 7,500 patent applications in process. We have tremendous strength not only in wireless 
standards but also wireless non-essential patents which are the patents which are required to deliver competitive 
products in the marketplace. And as a result of the combination of these patents we believe we'll be able to 
provide much better support to the businesses at Motorola Mobility as well as support the Android ecosystem. 
PATRICK PICHETTE: On my side for the NOLs, obviously Motorola has NOLs and taxes, deferred taxes related 
to them and we've taken that into consideration in our evaluation. So, thanks for the question. Why don't we go to 
the next question? 
OPERATOR: Anthony Diclemente, Barclays Capital. 
RON JOSEY, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Great, thanks. This is actually Ron Josey calling in for Anthony 
and thanks for taking our question. I just wondered if you can provide maybe a little more details on your 
conversations with Android partners and if there's a risk to them. I know you said you discussed with them prior to 
the acquisition. Just wanted a little more information. Thank you. 
LARRY PAGE: Thanks, Ron, for your question. I'll give that to Andy who has the most detail there. 
ANDY RUBIN, SVP OF MOBILE, GOOGLE INC.: I spoke yesterday to I think it was the top five Android licensees 
and they all showed very enthusiastic support for the deal. Android obviously was born as an open platform; it

Page 73 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
doesn't make sense for it to be a single OEM. We want to go as wide as possible and obviously all of our existing 
OEM partners help make it what it is today. 
LARRY PAGE: Thank you, can we have the next question? 
OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citigroup. 
MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Yes, a broad question for Larry, please. Larry, as you thought about 
different options here, what convinced you that actually acquiring Motorola was the optimal solution given you're 
going to be taking on some competencies that are clearly not core to Google, haven't been core to Google in the 
past in terms of manufacturing. So when you thought about the different ways that this deal could be struck or 
partnerships what made you decide this was the optimal one? Thank you. 
LARRY PAGE: I'm really excited about this deal and I think while there are competencies there that aren't core to 
us so, we're also -- as I mentioned, we're operating -- we'll plan to operate Motorola Mobility as a separate 
business so that they have competency there. 
And I'm really excited about protecting and supporting the Android ecosystem. And I think that their patent on 
Android two and a half years ago has really paid off and there's evidence from their success in the smartphone 
space. And we really believe that Motorola Mobility has tremendous opportunity for growth and will really create 
a lot of value in the future. 
And we really believe in the plans of the Motorola team, Sanjay and their vision for the future and really expect 
them to be successful. So I think this is a really unique opportunity and one that I'm tremendously excited about. 
MARK MAHANEY: Thank you, Larry. 
PATRICK PICHETTE: Let's go to next question, please. 
OPERATOR: Ross Sandler, RBC Asset Management. 
ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Thanks, guys. Two questions. Patrick, so you 
mentioned that this will be mildly accretive non-GAAP to Google. Can you just give us a time frame on that 
accretion? And then the second question would be around unit economics for Android going forward. So with the 
patent portfolio are you likely to have to pay any licensing fees along the lines of what HGT is currently paying or 
do you think that this will remove that risk? Thanks. 
LARRY PAGE: Thanks, Ross. Patrick, can you go ahead with the first question on the time and financials? 
PATRICK PICHETTE: Yes, the dilution and accretion question. So we expect actually that once the deal closes it 
will become marginally accretive immediately on that non-GAAP basis, so we're pretty thrilled about that. For the 
second question, why don't we let David cover it? 
DAVID DRUMMOND: Sure, this is David. Look, I think that we've seen some very aggressive licensing demands 
in the Android ecosystem and we think this is a result of having the patent portfolio we'll be able to make sure that 
Android remains open and vibrant and the kind of platform that lots of companies can (technical difficulty). 
LARRY PAGE: Thanks, Ross, for your questions. Can we have the next question? 
OPERATOR: Justin Post, Merrill Lynch. 
JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Great. You've had a lot of momentum with Android 
obviously. I want to follow up and just how do you think this changes Android from a partner's perspective? And 
you think you'll see your competitors like Microsoft and others really focus on how they're an open -- I mean not 
an open platform, but kind of a neutral platform? And do you think this really changes the overall mobile 
ecosystem? 
LARRY PAGE: Thanks for your question. I'll give the detail there to Andy, but I would say that we expect no -- 
there's no change in how we're running Android. Android is still open. Our partners are very excited about this 
and we are excited about it too. Andy. 
ANDY RUBIN: Thank you. Look, I mean, Motorola existed as one of the really, really early licensees of Android, 
they were a founding member of the Open Handset Alliance. After this transaction nothing changes, they're going

Page 74 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
to be a separate business and it's business as usual for Android. So I see it as basically protecting the ecosystem 
and extending it as well. 
LARRY PAGE: Okay, can we have the next question? 
OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Brian Pitz, UBS. 
BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, UBS: Great, thanks. Two quick questions. Your acquisitions have increasingly drawn 
FTC focus, Ad-Mob, ITA, AdMail, etc. Do you see that as a concern or impacting the timing of the close here? 
And then secondly, any comments to -- was this a competitive bid process and are there any change of control 
provisions we should really be focused on? Thanks. 
DAVID DRUMMOND: Sure, this is David. On the first question, this is a transaction obviously given its size that 
will require regulatory approval and a number -- certainly in the United States, certainly in Europe and possibly 
some other jurisdictions. 
We're quite confident that this will be approved. We believe very strongly this is a pro-competitive transaction and 
there are lots of reasons for that. But a couple of them -- Android has clearly added competition, innovation, 
increased user choice. We think that protecting that ecosystem is pro-competitive almost by definition. 
This is not a horizontal transaction. Google has not materially been in the handset business, so we think there are 
-- so this certainly doesn't draw those kinds of concerns and we certainly think this is a very competitive 
transaction. 
In terms of the -- you mentioned terms of the agreement. I think we'll be filing the agreement between Motorola 
and Google's public filings. We'll have the details of the agreement in those filings and those will be forthcoming 
shortly. 
LARRY PAGE: Our next question? 
OPERATOR: Ben Schachter, Macquarie. 
BEN SCHACHTER: Yes, sorry, guys, there was some confusion when I asked the original questions, just wanted 
to repeat them. If you could talk about legal ramifications both before the deal closes and after the deal closes 
and how that changes your position with some of the lawsuits that have already been filed. 
And then also, Patrick, if you could just go -- give the price a little bit more and help us understand how you 
actually put a price on the strategic value. Clearly a lot of this is around the portfolio, but how do you actually get 
to this price that you got and I also why no stock, why all-cash? Thanks. 
DAVID DRUMMOND: Ben, let me address the first part of the question and maybe turn it over Sanjay a little bit. 
In terms of before the acquisition closes those lawsuits will continue and be managed by Motorola, as they are 
now. I don't believe that Sanjay has more to add on those. And so I don't believe there is anything more to add. 
In terms of post acquisition, there's no -- we're obviously not going to talk about the legal strategy today. But 
suffice it to say that we believe we'll be in a very good position to protect the Android ecosystem for all of the 
partners. 
SANJAY JHA: Yes, Patrick, speaking about the valuation process, look, we're kind of clearly delighted that we 
expect the deal to in fact be mildly accretive on a non-GAAP basis, as I mentioned earlier, right. And then in that 
context, right, we really believe that we have a fair and full price for this transaction and it really is a transaction 
that gives us, when we did the valuation, great opportunity to accelerate the innovation success of Android. So it's 
in that context that we have the valuation. 
PATRICK PICHETTE: Thanks for your question, Ben. Can we go to the next question, please? 
OPERATOR: Jason Maynard, Wells Fargo. 
JASON MAYNARD, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO: Good morning, guys. I can appreciate you don't want to talk 
about the legal strategies at this point, but maybe you can talk about how do you manage, if you will, the business 
model issues related to your partners? What are the things that you're going to do to make sure that Android is 
still at the very least at an equal playing field? And how do you sort of firewall, if you will, some of the stuff or 
development issues that are invariably going to come up because you own Motorola now?

Page 75 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
LARRY PAGE: Thanks, Jason. I'll let Andy go into some detail on that. But I would say we've had tremendous 
success on Android because of our ability to manage and run that ecosystem with a number of different partners 
in the past and I expect we'll continue to do that well. And, Andy, please go ahead. 
ANDY RUBIN: Sure, and to add to Larry's points, we have this strategy where we have the Nexus program and 
we have this lead device strategy. That strategy has worked quite well to help focus the team. What we do is we 
select each -- around Christmastime of each year we select a manufacturer that we work very closely with to 
release a device in that time frame. 
That includes also semiconductor companies and all the components that go in the device. And essentially the 
teams huddle together in one building, they jointly work on these development efforts, they go on for 12 -- nine to 
12 months and ultimately at the holiday season or right before it devices pop out that are based on the this effort. 
We don't expect that to change at all. The acquisition is going to be run as a separate business; they will be part 
of that bidding process and part of that lead development process. And obviously Android remains open to other 
partners to use as they are today. 
LARRY PAGE: (technical difficulty) our next question? 
OPERATOR: Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs. 
HEATHER BELLINI, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. I actually 
had two this morning. I was wondering -- everyone is talking about the handset-related aspect of the deal. I was 
wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about how this might alter your ability to make a move more 
aggressively into the living room given their set-top box strategy. 
And the second question would be, to the extent you could talk a little bit about how the purchase of these patents 
might help in your defense in the case versus Oracle. Thank you. 
LARRY PAGE: Thanks, Heather, for your questions. I'll take a little bit of the first and Sanjay and maybe David 
can take the second. I think that Motorola is really a market leader in home devices and video solutions. We're 
really excited to work together with them and the industry to really accelerate innovation. Sanjay, can you add a 
little detail? 
SANJAY JHA: Thank you, Larry. We have a very close relationship with our carriers in the home space. As you 
know, there is a secular transition going on from what's called a QAM set-top box world to the Internet protocol, IP 
world. And I think in addition to that there is a great convergence happening between the mobile world and the 
content that enters the home through the set-top box. 
And I think as a result of this combination, and in working with our carriers, we'll be able to accelerate that 
convergence and deliver products which are -- which will delight customers quite friendly. So we're very excited 
about this combination. 
DAVID DRUMMOND: Sure. This is David, as to the second question -- we don't have anything more to add 
specifically about the Oracle strategy, but we can -- as you may have seen in our blog post recently, we believe 
that an ill-founded claim against Google and we're defending it very vigorously and we'll continue to. 
LARRY PAGE: The next question? 
OPERATOR: Youssef Squali, Jefferies. 
UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Thanks this is (inaudible) [Kahn] for Youssef. How competitive will you feel after 
acquiring these patents about your competitive position? Or in other words, how aggressively will you look to 
acquire more patents following this acquisition? 
LARRY PAGE: Thanks for the question. I'll let David address that. 
DAVID DRUMMOND: I think we've said for some time that we need to build our patent portfolio to make sure that 
Android and other businesses can be successful. So we will continue to do that. 
PATRICK PICHETTE: Great, thanks. Why don't I suggest is that if there are no more questions we'll actually turn 
it to Larry for his final thoughts and then we'll close the door for the questions. So, Larry, any last thoughts on --?

Page 76 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
LARRY PAGE: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Patrick. I think one thing I'd say is that we are really excited about this 
whole business and working with the Motorola team and all the employees and all the hard work there that's gone 
on over the years. And we at Google are very excited about this and I think the Motorola Mobility folks are as 
well and there's tremendous opportunity here. 
Android is growing like crazy; we think that will benefit all partners in the Android ecosystem including Motorola. 
And we're very excited about those opportunities going forward. It really allows us to supercharge the whole 
Android ecosystem. 
They made a great bet on Android that was really successful and that's made them the leading Android 
smartphone maker and we really believe that Motorola Mobility is poised for tremendous growth. And 
furthermore I'd say that the leading -- they're a leading home devices maker, that's also a big opportunity. And 
we're working with them and the industry to really accelerate innovation. 
So with that I want to thank everyone for joining us on such short notice and thank all of the employees at 
Motorola Mobility and at Google for all of their hard work and for all of you for spending time with us this 
morning.

Google deal gives Motorola Mobility's Plantation operations deep pockets 
Google deal gives Motorola Mobility's Plantation operations deep pockets

Shares of Motorola Mobility, which has operations in Plantation, soared Monday after Google announced plans 
to buy it for $12.5 billion in cash. 
The initial good news for South Florida jobs is that Google said Motorola Mobility will be run as a separate 
business. 
Motorola Mobility (NYSE: MMI) was up $13.65, or 55.78 percent, to close at $38.12, slightly below Google's 
offer of $40 a share. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) closed down $6.54, or 1.16 percent, to $556.34 a share. 
The deal is a watershed in the mobile handset market since Google's Android system has made inroads in a 
market dominated by the iPhone, made by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and BlackBerry, made by Research in 
Motion (NASDAQ: RIMM). Like Apple, Google will now have a captive hardware maker to go with its software. 
With control of mobile content, hardware and software, Google is going to be in a good position to compete with 
the Apples and Microsofts of the world, said Deborah Vazquez, CEO of Boca Raton-based IT staffing firm 
Protech and co-chair of the South Florida Technology Alliance. 
In addition, the deal "ensures that people will continue to innovate around the mobile space and in Android in 
particular," said Myk Willis, founder and CEO of Delray Beach-based Myxer, one of the largest service providers 
of personalized mobile entertainment. "HTC, Samsung and smaller companies, like ourselves, will now have a 
viable path to market in the mobile industry." 
Nonetheless, the announcement had little impact on Apple shares, which closed up $6.42, or 1.7 percent, to 
$383.41. 
The deal also offered a general tonic to the turbulent stock market, with the Dow closing up 213.88, or 1.9 percent 
to 11,482.90. Many technology companies have deep reserves of cash, so some Wall Street observers hope 
more tech deals could be in the offing. 
The deal brings a new deep-pocketed player to Broward County's growing wireless cluster and gives Google a 
treasure trove of 17,000 patents, which could be helpful as litigation increases in the competitive industry. 
Motorola Mobility lost $56 million on $3.33 billion in revenue for the quarter ended July 2. Google earned $2.51 
billion on revenue of $9.03 billion for the quarter ended June 30. 
Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions (NYSE: MSI) operate a 1 million-square-foot space for mobile device 
and home business services in Plantation, with about 1,400 employees. Motorola Mobility was previously the 
mobile devices division of Motorola, but became a separate company in January. 
If Google decides to add jobs in Broward County, the company could be eligible for a targeted industry incentive 
of up to $5,000 per job, depending on the average wage, said Bob Swindell, president and CEO of the Greater 
Fort Lauderdale Alliance. The alliance could also tap into funds from Gov. Rick Scott's Quick Action Closing Fund 
to make South Florida more competitive with other markets. 
Nonetheless, the deal "makes our ability to access Google a lot easier," Swindell said. 
"I think that a company like Google, spending that kind of money for a company with operations in South Florida, 
will bring some confidence and credibility to South Florida-based technology companies," Willis said. 
Broward County is a hotbed of wireless research because several major players moved in as Motorola downsized 
in 2008.

Page 78 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
RIM leases 127,976 square feet in Sunrise. Foxconn, a subsidiary of Chinese computer and electronics giant Hon 
Hai Precision Ltd., also has an engineering facility. Hon Hai is known for making the iPhone, among other 
products. 
These solid technology players, coupled with smaller niche companies, "start to create more of a critical mass 
and the type that we need to continue expanding on our footprint, in terms of technology," Vazquez said. 
South Florida is a hotbed of mobility and technology talent that is critical to Google's mission growth, she noted. 
Android will remain an open system, which means other companies can license it, as well, Google said. Motorola 
Mobility will be a licensee. 
In the technology field, it is common for a company to look for complementary technology that will help it further 
business, said Jane Teague, executive director of the Enterprise Development Corp. of South Florida. 
Companies cannot develop everything themselves, so executives typically go out into the marketplace and 
acquire companies that fill a niche, she added. 
Among Motorola's cutting-edge offerings is the Droid 3, which has a high-definition video screen, an 8-megapixel 
camera and a slide-out keyboard – the latter a feature the iPhone lacks. Priced at $59.99 with a wireless plan, the 
Droid undercuts the iPhone 4, which sells for $199 with a wireless plan. 
Google's offer has already been approved by board members of both companies. 
"Motorola Mobility’s total commitment to Android has created a natural fit for our two companies," Google CEO 
Larry Page said in a statement. "Together, we will create amazing user experiences that supercharge the entire 
Android ecosystem for the benefit of consumers, partners and developers. I look forward to welcoming 
Motorolans to our family of Googlers." 
"This transaction offers significant value for Motorola Mobility’s stockholders, and provides compelling new 
opportunities for our employees, customers and partners around the world," Motorola Mobility CEO Sanjay Jha 
said. "We have shared a productive partnership with Google to advance the Android platform, and now, through 
this combination, we will be able to do even more to innovate and deliver outstanding mobility solutions across 
our mobile devices and home businesses." 
"We expect that this combination will enable us to break new ground for the Android ecosystem," said Andy Rubin, 
Google senior VP of mobile. "However, our vision for Android is unchanged, and Google remains firmly 
committed to Android as an open platform and a vibrant open-source community. We will continue to work with all 
of our valued Android partners to develop and distribute innovative Android-powered devices." 
The transaction is expected to close by the early 2012.

Motorola Deal Could Boost Google TV 
Tech 
Motorola Deal Could Boost Google TV 
By Shara Tibken

The Wall Street Journal Online

Google Inc.'s proposed deal for Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. comes with a bonus--a strong set-top business 
that could help the Internet giant expand its Google TV offerings. 
Google TV, which allows users to search and access the full Web via TV sets and set-top boxes, has struggled to 
gain traction with consumers and has faced resistance from major networks. The device's high price point and the 
complicated interface have failed to appeal to users, who instead have turned to offerings from Apple Inc. and 
Silicon Valley startup Roku Inc. 
But Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility gives it an instant foothold in the set-top box market and a 
relationship with cable providers that previously viewed Google TV as a rival. In addition, it could allow Google to 
integrate its operating system into set-top boxes and introduce its own products similar to Apple TV, as opposed 
to working with electronics partners such as Sony Corp. 
"On top of everything else it's gaining, the acquisition gives Google the opportunity to set the direction on how it 
wants to see Google TV," Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg said. "Instead of trying to co-opt set-top boxes 
from [cable operators], now they have a company in the business of working with them and selling set-top boxes 
to them." 
That relationship could help Google increase its presence in people's living rooms and offer targeted video 
advertising. Motorola is among the top three set-top providers in the pay-TV industry, according to analysts. 
Motorola Mobility shares recently jumped 56% to $38.21, close to the offer price of $40 a share, while Google 
slipped 2% to $552.56. 
Google provided few details about its plans for Motorola Mobility's home business Monday, with Chief Executive 
Larry Page simply saying during a conference call that Google is "excited to work together with them and the 
industry to really accelerate innovation." 
Motorola Mobility Chief Executive Sanjay Jha said the company has "a very close relationship" with cable 
operators, something that should benefit the combined company. 
"There is a great convergence happening between the mobile world and the content that enters the home through 
the set-top box," he said. "And I think as a result of this combination, I mean working with our carriers, we'll be 
able to accelerate that convergence and deliver products...which will delight customers." 
Barclays analyst James Ratcliffe said the deal has risk and potential upside for cable providers, with the pay-TV 
providers likely viewing the acquisition "warily" as an emerging competitor now becomes a key vendor. He said, 
on the positive side, the transaction could accelerate integration of Internet capability into cable set-top boxes, 
which have not historically innovated as rapidly as the consumer electronics industry as a whole. 
Google unveiled its Google TV software to much fanfare at its developers conference last year. The product was 
part of the company's broader push to become a force in the distribution of TV shows, movies and other media 
content. But its partners have reported lackluster sales, reviews have been tepid, and not all Internet content has 
been available on the devices, including the popular Hulu video-streaming site. 
Logitech International SA, which makes the Revue set-top box and special keyboard built on Google's 
technology, last month said Revue revenue was "slightly negative" in the latest quarter as more units were

Page 80 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
returned than purchased. The company slashed the price of the Revue to $99 from $249 on hopes it would spur 
sales. 
IDC analyst Greg Ireland said that even if Google integrates its software into set-top boxes, cable operators likely 
will be hesitant to embrace Google TV. 
"It comes down to whether service providers want to give up control to Google," he said. "They want low-cost 
devices and don't want to pay for extra functionality that isn't driving their particular business interests." 
Mr. Ireland noted Motorola Mobility's Medios content-management software could benefit Google, allowing it to 
integrate its advertising into future versions of the platform. Medios allows service providers to manage content 
across multiple screens, with users able to start watching a video on their TV and then resume the movie on their 
tablet or smartphone. 
"With the adoption of connected devices ranging from game consoles to media tablets, the importance of the 
[set-top box] is diminished in future connected home and connected consumer content consumption scenarios," 
Ireland said. "Medios is a key part of this transition." 
Motorola Mobility earlier this month reported second-quarter sales of $907 million in its home business, up 2% 
from the previous year.

What Will the Google, Motorola Deal Mean For Your HDTV? Google's purchase of Motorola Mobility 
doesn't just affect smartphones; Google now owns a major cable box developer and manufacturer.

Google's purchase of Motorola Mobility made a lot of headlines this morning, with everyone asking what this will 
mean for Android phones. But that leaves a very important issue almost untouched: what the deal will mean for 
HDTVs and home theaters. 
Besides phones, Motorola Mobility also develops set-top boxes and DVRs. You can't go to Best Buy and pick 
them up, but if you get a digital cable box from any cable provider, there's a good chance it will be running on 
Motorola hardware. That means, as cable companies get new set-top boxes in, they won't just run on Motorola 
hardware. They'll run on Google hardware and software. 
Google hasn't forgotten about its smart entertainment technology, Google TV. While we haven't seen a new 
Google TV product this year, the company will likely announce a new version of the software in the next few 
months. With Motorola Mobility, there's a good chance we might see it appear in cable boxes. Google is getting 
a set-top box division with a massive and automatic install base, and the company would be foolish not to exploit 
it to increase market share of its own products. 
In a 
blog post announcing the deal, Google chief Larry Page acknowledged that Motorola is "a market leader in the 
home devices and video solutions business. With the transition to Internet Protocol, we are excited to work 
together with Motorola and the industry to support our partners and cooperate with them to accelerate innovation 
in this space," he said. During a later conference call, Page said Google will work with cable and telecom 
companies on that effort. We probably won't see Google TV set-top boxes this year, but January's Consumer 
Electronics Show might include the announcement of a whole new wave of cable boxes featuring the latest 
version of Google's software. While Google and Motorola Mobility probably won't show off any products besides 
Google TV itself, cable companies will start to show off their newest feature: Google TV built into the box, offered 
at a premium to digital cable customers. 
The Motorola Mobility buyout won't just mean Google TV built into cable boxes, though. Google has other 
software and services that would mesh well with digital cable services and Motorola's set-top boxes. Social 
networks like Facebook and Twitter have made a big impact on HDTVs and Blu-ray players, with several 
connected devices offering direct interaction, letting users keep track of their friends on their HDTVs. Google+ has 
picked up a lot of users, and with Motorola thrown into the mix, we could start to see Google's social network get 
support through cable providers. 
Even without Google TV and Google+ breaking onto Motorola boxes, Google's purchase will probably result in 
more Android integration with digital cable companies. Time Warner Cable's iOS app could see an Android 
equivalent, and Comcast and Verizon might see similar Android smartphone control of set-top boxes. With 
Google owning both the set-top box development process and the Android operating system, there would be no 
reason for it not to develop something that could locally control a cable box or set a DVR from far away. 
They might not be advertised on TV with surreal commercials involving cyborgs, but Motorola set-top boxes are a 
big deal for digital cable companies. Now that Google owns the company that made that box, you might see a lot 
more Google on your HDTV in the coming months.

Google is buying cell phone maker Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in cash. The deal will give the Mountain 
View, Calif. company the means to support the Android operating system through more than 16,000 patents and 
intellectual property and innovations. The move is Google's biggest acquisition to date. 
"Motorola's total commitment to Android in mobile devices is one of many reasons that there is a natural fit 
between our two companies," Larry Page, Google CEO, wrote in a blog post. "Together, we will create amazing 
user experiences that supercharge the entire Android ecosystem for the benefit of consumers, partners and 
developers everywhere." 
Global Equities Research Analyst Trip Chowdhry estimates that prior to this acquisition Google owned about 520 
patents related to Android, mostly in software. Motorola is one of nearly 40 manufacturers that build the Android 
operating system into its products. Only two other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) will own more 
Android-related patents, according to Chowdhry, with Samsung at 36,674; and LG at 31,276. 
"The brains, innovation and ideas all captured in the intellectual property make the difference," Chowdhry said. 
"This is an acquisition to make sure Google has the smartest people with the best ideas and a rich portfolio of 
patents. It is to protect Google's ecosystem." 
Chowdhry said Google will likely allow Motorola Mobility to run on its own, to enable the company to move 
forward in mobile innovations through near field communications and Google Wallet for mobile devices. 
Motorola holds 9.62% of the handset market, Chowdhry estimates. The company falls in line after Apple with 
32.08%; Samsung, 15.22%; HTC, 10.69%; and Research In Motion, 10.62%. 
Google will continue to struggle with smartphone market competitors. Nokia's share of shipments declined to 
15.1% in the second quarter, down from 23.6%, sequentially -- allowing Apple to climb one place to take the No. 1 
position, according to market research firm iSuppli. 
Apple only slightly outperformed the overall smartphone market, with its shipments rising by 9.1% sequentially. 
Samsung took the No. 2 spot, up from fourth place in Q1, as its shipments jumped by 55.6%. HTC posted the 
second-best performance among the top brands, with its shipments rising by 24.6 percent compared to the first 
quarter, wrote iSuppli Analyst Tina Teng in a research note. 
Last month, Motorola Mobility reported selling 440,000 units of the tablet Xoom, powered by Android, in the 
second quarter of 2011 -- but at a net loss of $56 million for the company overall. 
During a conference call with analysts in July, Motorola Mobility Chief Financial Officer Marc Rothman said Q3 
sales should rise slightly sequentially. As Xoom sales continue to accelerate, he expects smartphone and tablet 
shipments for the year to fall somewhere between 21 million and 23 million. This year, however, tablet sales are 
slower than expected -- although the company beat analyst estimates of 300,000 for the latest quarter. At the 
time, Motorola Mobility estimates were to ship between 1.3 million and 1.5 million tablets in 2011, down from 
roughly 2 million.

(Adds anti-trust and other details, fund manager's comment) 
By Sinead Carew and Alexei Oreskovic 
NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Google Inc's biggest deal ever, acquiring Motorola Mobility 
Holdings Inc for $12.5 billion, is an attempt to buy insurance against increasingly aggressive legal attacks from 
rivals such as Apple Inc. 
The acquisition of one of the mobile telecommunications industry's most storied names is Google co-founder 
Larry Page's boldest move since taking over as CEO in April, launching the Internet giant into a lower-margin 
manufacturing business and pitting it against many of the 38 other handset companies that now use its Android 
software. 
Motorola Inc was split this year into two: Motorola Mobility, which got the faster-growing cellphone and TV 
set-top box businesses; and Motorola Solutions, which sells gear like walkie-talkies to corporate and government 
clients. 
Google is paying a massive 63 percent premium to gain access to one of the mobile phone industry's largest 
patent libraries. The company had been under pressure to build a patent portfolio after losing out to Apple, 
Microsoft Corp and others in a recent auction of bankrupt Nortel's assets. 
Unlike the Nortel deal and others, the fact that Google avoided having to compete in an auction for Motorola by 
engaging in exclusive negotiations for the company underscores the pressure it was under to bolster its patent 
portfolio. Paying such a rich premium even though it was the only buyer dovetails with analysts' view that the 
increasingly litigious posture its competitors have taken over intellectual property left the Internet search giant with 
no choice but to pay up. 
"No matter how you think about this, you have to look at it through the spectrum of the Android ecosystem under 
incredible attack from an IP (intellectual property) perspective. And this is Google going out and trying to fix that," 
said W.P. Stewart Advisors Chief Investment Officer Jim Tierney. "The biggest implication here is that Google 
wants Android to be one of the dominant phone operating systems for years to come." 
Wall Street quickly anointed Microsoft a winner in this deal, with Windows benefiting should the move spur current 
Android partners to explore other options. 
The deal also stoked speculation that struggling Nokia and Research in Motion would become takeover targets 
themselves, sending Nokia's shares up 17.35 percent and RIM's up 10.3 percent. 
Google made its first foray into hardware by co-developing the Nexus One phone with HTC in 2010 -- an effort 
that met mixed results. Monday's deal, however, could mark the start of a shift to an Apple-style model, 
integrating mobile hardware with underlying software.

"Google decided to cross the Rubicon on the device side," said Fred Huet, head of telecoms and media 
consultancy Greenwich Consulting. "There has been growing frustration (at Google) about the lack and speed of 
internet centric devices. 
"With Nexus they tried to show the industry what they thought was the right evolution for handsets and it did not 
have an impact .... With the patents they make sure that Android stays strong." 
THE MORE THINGS CHANGE ... 
The acquisition is likely to draw even closer regulatory scrutiny than usual, with the search leader already the 
subject of antitrust inquiries. Experts will want to review how it affects mobile industry competition. 
But the deal -- which took Wall Street by surprise -- appears to mark a shift in strategy from Google's traditional 
Internet search and advertising empire and forays into video and social networking. 
"The danger is that other handset makers feel disenfranchised," said Nomura Securities global technology 
specialist Richard Windsor. "Motorola is the weaker player. This could actually collapse the entire community." 
Page, who also launched the ambitious Google+ social network since taking over as CEO, reassured investors on 
Monday this would not happen, saying Motorola will be run as a separate company licensing Android software in 
the same way as rivals like HTC Corp and LG Electronics. 
Phone makers including Samsung officially said they welcomed a deal that will aid their own legal battles, but 
some analysts questioned the sincerity of those claims, noting that rival companies would now be unlikely to 
heavily promote Android since it would benefit a direct competitor. 
Andy Lees, president of the Windows Phone Division at Microsoft, said in a statement that, "Investing in a broad 
and truly open mobile ecosystem is important for the industry and consumers alike, and Windows Phone is now 
the only platform that does so with equal opportunity for all partners." 
Some analysts also doubt that Google will continue manufacturing handsets in the long term. 
"We don't think they necessarily want to be in the handset business. They want those patents first and foremost," 
said Brian Pitz, an analyst at UBS. "This is really a game of protection." 
Analysts say that Google's rivals are likely to continue to enforce their patent rights on mobile devices through 
legal means. Microsoft, for instance, recently settled a lawsuit with HTC over the Taiwanese company's Android 
devices. Oracle is also seeking billions of dollars from Google for infringing on Java patents. Analysts expect 
Apple to continue its increasingly effective patent war against its rivals as well, which could hurt Google by 
potentially raising licensing costs that need to be paid to Apple. 
While Apple's iPhone leads in market prestige and is considered more innovative, Android has managed to 
quietly surpass it in market share. Android held a 43.4 percent share of the smartphone market at the end of the 
second quarter, ahead of Nokia's 22 percent, according to Gartner data. Apple ranked third with 18 percent, the 
data showed. 
Shares of Motorola Mobility jumped more than 55 percent on the news, while Google shares fell by roughly 1 
percent. 
The deal values Motorola Mobility at $40 per share in cash, a 63 percent premium to its Friday closing price. 
The terms of the deal also features an unusually rich reverse breakup fee of $2.5 billion, according to a source 
close to the situation. 
"It's a deal that will take time to pay off, but they have a lot of cash and they want to chase after profit," BGC 
Partners analyst Colin Gillis said. 
The deal delivers a windfall for investors including Carl Icahn, Motorola's top shareholder with a stake of just over 
11 percent. The activist shareholder had been urging Motorola to look into splitting off its patent business -- one of 
the biggest in the industry -- from its handset business, ranked eighth in the world by Gartner in terms of unit 
sales. In late July, Icahn even went so far as to estimate that Motorola could be worth $44 per share, or $13 
billion in a sale. 
Despite cashing out for $4 less than what he estimated the company was worth, Icahn said he was "quite happy 
with this result."

Page 87 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
It's unclear how much Icahn spent on his stake in Motorola since he started scooping up shares in 2007, but 
regulatory filings indicate it may have been about $3 billion. His stake in Motorola Mobility is worth about $1.34 
billion at the deal price, up by $520 million since Friday. Including his stake in Motorola Solutions, Icahn's total 
stake is about about $2.9 billion in the two companies. 
INTO THE LIVING ROOM 
As part of the deal, Google also gets Motorola's set-top box businesses, giving its nascent TV operation a 
much-needed boost by providing it with a more direct route into the home. 
Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett noted that Google, a frequent disrupter of the pay-television market via its 
ownership of YouTube and launching of over-the-top TV products that allow consumers to get streaming video in 
the home, will now be one of its largest suppliers. 
"It will be fascinating to see whether this tempers their enthusiasm for disruptive business models as they have to 
face the practical realities of satisfying their cable customers," said Moffett. "I think the cable industry would be 
delighted to see Google inside the tent." 
Google said it expects the deal to close by the end of 2011 or early in 2012, and that it was confident it would gain 
the regulatory approvals required in the United States and Europe and the blessing of Motorola Mobility's 
shareholders. 
Others aren't so sure. 
"The legal question here is would this deal give Google the incentive to make Android less open or somehow 
discriminate against the other smart phone and tablet makers," said Beau W. Buffier, a lawyer with Shearman & 
Sterling LLP. "That will be the key issues in any review both here in the U.S. or in Europe." 
The fact that the deal has the support of other major mobile device players who have a stake in the matter should 
help Google in the regulatory process. 
Lazard advised Google on the deal, while Motorola used Centerview Partners and Frank Quattrone's Qatalyst 
Partners, sources told Reuters.

Google has agreed to acquire mobile device manufacturer Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion. The acquisition is 
expected to close early next year. 
Motorola Mobility will operate as a separate business, Google said in a blog post announcing the acquisition. 
Google's Android mobile operating system is the sole OS running across Motorola Mobility's smartphones and 
tablets, Google CEO and cofounder Larry Page said during a conference call. Googleacquired Android in July 
2005. 
Andy Rubin, Android founder and SVP of mobile at Google, said during the conference call that Android will 
remain open for other device manufacturers to license. 
Android accounted for 54% of the ad impressions served by Millennial Media in the second quarter, while 
Motorola had the fifth-highest share of mobile ad impressions in June at 9%, the mobile ad network said. 
Motorola spun off its mobile device business into Motorola Mobility in January. Motorola Mobility reported a 
21% year-over-year increase in second-quarter net revenue to $3.3 billion, but posted a $56 million net loss.

--Competitors have tried Apple's approach and had mixed results 
(Updates to include Google comment in the sixth paragraph.) 
By Ian Sherr 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
SAN FRANCISCO -(Dow Jones)- Google Inc.'s (GOOG) proposed $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility 
Holdings Inc. (MMI) underscores the allure of a business model pioneered by one of the company's rivals: Apple 
Inc. (AAPL). 
On Monday, Google said it was buying the Libertyville, Ill., handset-and-tablet maker for its portfolio of roughly 
24,000 patents. Those patents would give the search giant protection of its intellectual property in an increasingly 
litigious technology environment. 
The move also gives the Mountain View, Calif., Internet company an opportunity to build handsets and tablets 
from the ground up with its popular Android operating system. That would mimic Apple's success in integrating 
hardware and software, a strategy that has also inspired other companies, including Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) 
and Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM, RIM.T). 
The growing desire to build integrated hardware and software highlights the success Apple has had with its tightly 
controlled iPhone and iPad platforms. Apple created the smartphone market with its iPhone, which was widely 
praised for its ease of use and functionality. And Apple's iPad dominates the market for touchscreen tablet 
computers despite a host of challengers. 
"Vertical integration is clearly the business model of the day," Gartner Inc. (IT) analyst Van Baker said. 
A Google spokeswoman directed reporters to comments Chief Executive Larry Page made earlier in the day 
during a press conference explaining the deal. During the call, Page said Android would remain an open-source 
platform available to all of the company's hardware partners. 
"We look forward to continuing our work with all of them on an equal basis," Page said. 
H-P declined to comment. Apple and RIM did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Google will also benefit from Motorola's already existing Android products. Motorola has been building Android 
phones for two years, releasing the popular "Droid" phone in 2009 to much fanfare in the U.S. Motorola has since 
expanded its lineup of Android phones to include low-priced models. 
Motorola has also tweaked Google's Android software, creating its own software called "Motoblur," which is 
designed to help customers connect with social networks, like Facebook Inc., more effectively. It also launched its 
"Atrix" phone earlier this year, a specialized device that docks with a keyboard and monitor to double as a laptop 
computer.

Page 90 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Of course, marrying hardware and software is not easy. Apple has pursued the strategy since it was founded in 
1976, giving it 35 years to refine the model. Challengers are already finding it difficult to replicate that success 
quickly. 
For example, H-P slashed the price of its TouchPad tablet, which uses an operating system the company 
purchased last year, after reviewers complained about both the hardware and software. 
RIM's first tablet, the PlayBook, has also fared poorly in the market. Critics have complained that its QNX 
operating system, which RIM also purchased last year, was not ready for prime time. 
"At the end of the day, it'll be difficult to compete against the design team in Cupertino," said Gleacher & Co. 
analyst Brian Marshall, referring to the California city in which Apple is headquartered. 
Still, Google has shown it is willing to try. Google has released new versions of Android at a rapid pace, adding 
new features that either match or surpass Apple's functionality. The latest iteration, called "Ice Cream Sandwich," 
marries Android's tablet and smartphone software, giving Google an opportunity to refine features that have 
become successful on each platform.

Google Faces Integration Challenges With Motorola Deal 
Google Faces Integration Challenges With Motorola Deal 
By Matt Jarzemsky 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

15 August 2011

Dow Jones Business News 
DJON 
English 
(c) 2011 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Google Inc.'s (GOOG) biggest purchase, the deal for Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. 
(MMI), presents the Internet company with its biggest challenge in integrating a new acquisition. 
Unlike its previous deals for online video provider YouTube and Internet advertising company DoubleClick, 
Google is buying an older, more established company with a focus on making hardware, not software. Plus, 
Motorola is based in the suburbs of Chicago, far from Google's Silicon Valley home. 
"It will be interesting to see just how deeply ingrained Motorola will be within Google," said Chris Hazelton, a 
mobile and wireless analyst at research firm 451 Group. "Will it be the golden child or just the black sheep that 
gave them all their" intellectual property? 
Motorola's patent portfolio is a key feature of the deal. Google has fewer patents in mobile technology than some 
competitors, which could hobble it as smartphone companies increasingly look to patent litigation to give 
themselves an edge. 
Google Chief Executive Larry Page said Monday that Motorola will operate as a separate entity and that "my 
intention is to work closely with the Motorola teams and let [Motorola Chief Executive] Sanjay [Jha] and his 
management team drive the business." 
Both companies declined to comment further on the integration process, which will go a long way to determining 
the deal's success. 
Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette said Monday that Google has "a proven track record on 
acquisitions." Other notable purchases by the company include DoubleClick, the display-ad provider it bought for 
$3.11 billion in 2007, and YouTube LLC, which it acquired for $1.56 billion in 2006. 
The DoubleClick deal was a significant step in Google's expansion into advertising, which has become a core 
business alongside search; meanwhile, Pichette said in July that strength in YouTube and other new areas 
helped drive the company's strong second-quarter financial results. However, both deals were smaller than 
Motorola and involved software companies. 
Google not only moves into the hardware business with the Motorola acquisition but is forced to help turn around 
the company's declining market share. Motorola sold 10.2 million mobile devices in the second quarter, good 
enough for a 2.4% market share, down from 2.5% a year earlier, according to Gartner. 
"It's an open question whether Google, a novice in hardware, can turn Motorola around without anointing it 
favored status within the Android license community," Needham & Co. analyst Charlie Wolf said. Doing so, 
though, could push away other vendors, such as Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE). 
"If Google were to favor Motorola, the company risks alienating its other Android licensees," Wolf said, noting 
there are 38 such licensees. 
Adding to the merger's complexity is the different attitudes at the two companies. Motorola's broader corporate 
culture, with an emphasis on process and procedure, differs from Google's more flexible, innovation-driven 
approach. 
"In some sense, they're both engineering-driven cultures," said Ken Delaney, vice president of research at 
Gartner Inc. "There's probably a spirit of more flexibility in Google than there was inside Motorola."

Page 92 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
In addition to their Android partnership, the companies do have some connections. Hazelton noted that Motorola 
recently acquired Three Laws Mobility, a startup that makes security software for Android devices and was 
founded by former Google employees. 
"Motorola has been working with Google for a while on a lot of projects," the 451 Group analyst said. "The 
communication links are already there."

--Google purchase would lend it about 17,000 new patents 
--Motorola has been more active in patenting than Google 
--Google cites need for protection from Microsoft, Apple 
By John Letzing 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
SAN FRANCISCO -(Dow Jones)- Google Inc.'s (GOOG) planned acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. 
(MMI) will provide it with a trove of intellectual property that could help protect it against a weakness in its 
open-source software strategy: A lack of emphasis on locking down patents. 
On Monday, Google said it would pay $12.5 billion in cash to buy Motorola, which makes a host of handsets that 
run the search giant's Android operating system. Android, which is also used by other manufacturers, is the most 
popular smartphone operating system in the world with 43% of the market, according to Gartner Inc. 
Android is an example of open-source software that is designed to allow outside engineers to tinker with the way 
it works. While that makes Android highly customizable--companies using the software can optimize it for their 
devices--it also has left the operating system vulnerable to intellectual-property lawsuits. 
Motorola's patents will help Google address that weakness, which already has prompted a lawsuit by database 
giant Oracle Corp. (ORCL). Motorola, of Libertyville, Ill., holds or has applied for a total of 24,500 patents. 
The proposed acquisition comes as patent protection emerges as a key area of corporate strategy. Technology 
companies are amassing intellectual-property arsenals to both defend against litigation and as a weapon for 
countersuits. Google's partners, including Motorola, have been popular targets of lawsuits, including actions by 
Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). 
"Google has a very small patent portfolio compared to its peers, said David Mixon, a patent attorney at Bradley 
Arant Boult Cummings LLP, noting that is an outgrowth of the company's participation in the open-source 
movement. "They tended to neglect development of their patent portfolio." 
Motorola could help change that dynamic. 
The company, which split from Motorola Inc. earlier this year, has outpaced Google in terms of patent activity. In 
the five years ending in December 2010, Motorola had roughly 4,300 pre-grant applications for U.S. patents, 
according to IFI Claims Patent Services. That is more than four times the number of pre-grant applications for 
Google in the same period. 
In the year through July 26, Motorola has been awarded 174 U.S. patents, compared to 168 for Google, 
according to IFI Claims Patent Services. 
Motorola's patents include an "ornamental design" for a device storage case, granted last month, and a method 
for maintaining the flow of data to devices from data centers, granted in June. 
Motorola's intellectual-property strength has been noted by investor Carl Icahn. Last month, Icahn disclosed in a 
regulatory filing that he had urged Motorola Mobility to explore options for its valuable patent portfolio.

Page 94 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Apple and Microsoft both have sued Motorola as a proxy for Google, claiming that Motorola devices running on 
Android violate their patents. Google Chief Executive Larry Page said in a blog post that the acquisition would 
help Google protect Android from such litigation. 
"Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Google's patent portfolio, which will enable 
us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies," Page said. 
A Google spokesman declined to provide further comment. 
The patent trove also may help Google protect itself from direct litigation. 
Last August, Oracle sued Google, claiming that Android infringed on patents and copyrights associated with the 
database company's Java software. 
Earlier this month, Oracle sought unsuccessfully to have Motorola Mobility produce a witness for deposition in 
that case, which is expected to come to trial in October. 
An Oracle spokeswoman declined to comment.

By Tom Loftus 
Today's $12.5 billion Motorola Mobility deal represents Google's largest acquisition to date, but the Internet 
giant has forged quite a number of deals--at least 100--over the past 10 years. 
Here's a look at some past deals, from the most influential to one might-have-been. 
DoubleClick 
Deal announced: April 13, 2007 
Price: $3.1 billion 
Google was only a marginal player in the display advertising market when it picked up dot-com bubble survivor 
DoubleClick, a veteran display ad company that ruled the market and the relationships with its gatekeepers--the 
online publishers and ad agencies. 
Today Google has become a display ad player in its own right. According to eMarketer, Google is expected to 
grab 12.6% of the U.S. display-ad market by the end of the year, or $1.3 billion, up from 9.6% last year. Earlier 
this year, Google announced that it was using DoubleClick Ad Exchange to expand into the video marketplace. 
Android 
Deal announced: August 17, 2005 
Price: $50 million (estimated) 
When Google purchased the 22-month-old startup from tech wunderkind Andy Rubin in the summer of 2005, who 
could have predicted how fast its open-sourced mobile operating system would grow? After their purchase, the 
Android team developed the mobile device platform that would become the Android operating system. The rest is 
history. At Google's quarterly earnings call last month, CEO Larry Page said that 550,000 phones a day are 
being activated with the Android OS. 
Rubin remains a vice president of engineering at Google. 
Admob 
Deal announced: Nov. 9, 2009 
Price: $750 million 
The purchase of the mobile advertising platform earned Google a review by the Federal Trade Commission 
based on complaints that Google was buying its way into the market. The deal was eventually approved. Recently 
the Wall Street Journal cited people close to the deal saying that the business could generate $1 billion in 
revenue for Google within the next year to 18 months. 
YouTube

Page 96 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Deal announced: Oct. 9, 2006 
Price: $1.65 billion 
The video site is the world's No. 3 website in terms of unique monthly visitors. Last year YouTube generated $544 
million in net revenue from advertising. Positioning itself to become a major player in the living room as online 
video streaming sites gain acceptance as go to sources for home entertainment, YouTube recently announced 
plans to spend as much as $100 million in commissioning low-cost content. 
The site is expected to generate more than $800 million this year in net revenue (the site's share after payouts to 
content creators). 
ITA Software 
Deal announced: July 1, 2010 
Price: $700 million 
Google's move to buy flight-data company ITA Software attracted the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice 
after airline ticket search and booking sites such as Kayak, Sabre Holdings and Expedia voiced concerns that 
Google could use its search engine dominance to direct users to its own travel services. 
The Justice Department approved the buyout in April of this year. As part of the agreement, Google must license 
ITA technology to other websites for five years. 
Dodgeball 
Deal announced: May 12, 2005 
Price: Unknown 
An early acquisition, Dodgeball used a mobile text service to facilitate location-based meet-ups in 20 U.S. cities. 
The service did not last in the Googleplex and by 2009 it was discontinued. One of Dodgeball's founders, Dennis 
Crowley, would later start the popular location-based service Foursquare.

By Shira Ovide 
Let's be frank: Google has been a spectacular failure in television. But could Google's $12.5 billion purchase of 
cell phone maker Motorola Mobility help snatch victory from the jaws of defeat? 
Motorola Mobility and Cisco are the dominant providers of those ubiquitous boxes that control cable television 
service. That might be a handy market foothold for Google, which in the last year has launched Google TV -- a 
mash up of cable-TV listings and Web video. 
So far, Google and its partners, Logitech International and Sony Corp., have found rough seas. Logitech, in fact, 
recently said returns of Google TV are outpacing sales. Yes, that is NEGATIVE revenue from Google TV. Ouch. 
In today's conference call with Wall Street analysts, Google was asked whether it can use Motorola Mobility to 
make a more successful push into TV. In what sounded to us like a very carefully scripted answer, Google CEO 
Larry Page said Motorola is a "market leader in home devices and video solutions....We're really excited to work 
together with them and the industry to really accelerate innovation." 
Hmmm....that's not much of an answer. Motorola Mobility CEO Sanjay Jha also chimed in that his company's 
takeover by Google can "accelerate convergence" of the traditional TV world and the Internet. So stay tuned, 
folks. Recall those rumors that Apple is working on its own Internet-enabled TV? Maybe Google will give up on 
the middle man and also work on its own TV? 
At the very least, small cable operators are holding their breath about the possible market fallout from the 
Google-Motorola deal. 
"We're going to review the deal to understand the impact on the cable set-top box market, which has been a 
frustrating one for small cable operators long beholden to the Motorola-Cisco duopoly," The American Cable 
Association, a trade group of small and medium-sized cable companies, said in a statement today. 
"ACA members will want assurances from Google that it is both committed to the cable business model and won't 
use its market power to run roughshod over smaller cable operators."

Of ALL THINGS DIGITAL 
Quick take from Google Inc.'s (GOOG) investor call to discuss its pending deal for Motorola Mobility Holdings 
Inc. (MMI): The search company is spending $12.5 billion on around 25,000 patents, and getting a handset maker 
too. 
That's if you take the company at its word: Google insists that it's going to run Motorola Mobility as a separate 
operating unit, and that doing so will mean that it won't grant it any special advantages compared to other Android 
partners like Samsung Electronics Co. (SSNHY, 005930.SE), HTC Corp. (HTCXF, 2498.TW), etc. 
So if that's the case, the real value would seem to be Motorola's patent stash, which Google thinks will be a 
valuable weapon in the high-stakes arms race that has recently started up. Which is why Google executives used 
the word "protect" at least six times while explaining the deal Monday morning. 
Google Chief Executive Larry Page used the verb in his opening remarks, referencing Apple Inc. (AAPL), 
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and others; he and his lieutenants used the word most often when discussing Motorola's 
patent portfolio. Presumably they'll use the same language when they discuss the deal with regulators in the U.S. 
and Europe. 
--- 
EARLIER 
Guess that federal antitrust investigation isn't spooking Google, after all. The search company is buying 
Motorola's mobile handset business for $12.5 billion. Google says its purchase of Motorola Mobility "will enable 
Google to supercharge the Android ecosystem and will enhance competition in mobile computing." If it closes, the 
$40-a-share purchase will represent approximately a 63% premium to Motorola Mobility's closing price on 
Friday. 
First and foremost, Google is buying a major manufacturer of its phones that support its Android line. Last 
quarter, Motorola sold 10.6 million handsets, up 28% from the year-earlier quarter. Of that, 4.4 million--or about 
42%--were smartphones. It also sold 440,000 media tablets. 
It is not a cash machine: Last quarter the company, spun off from the main Motorola business at the beginning of 
the year, lost $53 million on sales of $3.3 billion; it had operating losses of $23 million. 
Google and Motorola Mobility will host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time; I'll cover it live here. 
8:31 a.m.: Good morning! Thanks to Google for puncturing yet another hole in the "August is a slow news month" 
theory.

Page 99 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
8:32 a.m.: On the call: Larry Page, Google CEO; Sanjay Jha, Motorola Mobility CEO; Patrick Pichette, Google 
CFO; David Drummond, Google corporate-development boss; Andy Rubin, Android head; Nikesh Arora, Google 
chief business officer. 
8:35 a.m.: Here's Larry, reading from a statement. Chronology: In May 2005, I met Andy Rubin, who had a "crazy" 
vision for open-source platform for mobile. Now Android is "one of the leading platforms in the industry." "Andy, or 
should I say Android, has grown tremendously" since the 2007 launch. 
8:36 a.m.: Praise for Motorola: "Sanjay made a big bet" by using Android as sole MMI developer. 
8:37 a.m.: Specifically calls out MMI patent portfolio, "which will help protect" Google from Apple, Microsoft, 
others. 
8:39 a.m.: We've talked to "key partners" in ecosystem and they're all excited about this. (Doesn't mention any, by 
name, though.) 
8:39 a.m.: Now Sanjay Jha, who's in Mountain View, Calif., with his new to-be bosses. 
8:40 a.m.: After focusing on Android, "the results speak for themselves." 
8:41 a.m.: Reeling off statistics about international success, partnerships. 
8:41 a.m.: Now Patrick Pichette. 
8:41 a.m.: Going over basics of deal: Says deal will be "mildly accretive." MMI will run as separate business. 
Won't affect Google's core business in any way with regard to profit, operations, etc. Also won't prevent us from 
doing other M&A--we've done 120 in the past couple of years. 
8:43 a.m.: Q&A 
8:43 a.m.: Q: For Drummond--please go over legal consequences of patent portfolio, both pre- and post-deal. 
(Guess not: technical difficulties) 
8:44 a.m.: Another question about patent portfolio--true that there are 15,000 patents and another 7,500 pending? 
(Google seems to be having tech problems with the calls.) 
8:45 a.m.: OK, here's Drummond: I'll let Sanjay talk about MMI patents. We've said we'll protect Android's patent 
situation, and it's under threat from "some entities," but combining with MMI "is a good thing." 
8:46 a.m.: Jha: We have more than 17,000 patents and another 7,500 pending. "We believe we'll be able to 
provide much better support to businesses" at MMI and Android. 
8:47 a.m.: Pichette says yes, MMI has some NOLs (tax issue). 
8:47 a.m.: Q: More details on chats with Android partners you said were psyched about this, please. 
8:48 a.m.: Rubin: I talked yesterday to Top 5 Android licensees. Doesn't make sense for Android to be a single 
OEM, so we expect to keep working with everyone. 
8:48 a.m.: Larry, why buy Motorola when manufacturing is not core to your competency? 
8:49 a.m.: Page: "I'm really excited about this deal." But we'll operate MMI as a separate unit, and they have 
competency. This is about "protecting" and accelerating growth of Android. (Basically a nonanswer.) 
8:50 a.m.: Q: Time frame on accretion? Also, will you have to pay licensing fees, a la HTC, or does this remove 
that risk? 
8:50 a.m.: Pichette: We expect that once the deal closes, it becomes accretive immediately. 
8:51 a.m.: Drummond: "We've seen some very aggressive licensing demands in the Android system," but sort of 
a nonanswer here, too.

Page 100 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
8:51 a.m.: Q: How does this change Android from partner perspective? Do you think Microsoft now positions itself 
as a "neutral" platform? 
8:52 a.m.: Page: No change to Android. Still an open ecosystem. 
8:52 a.m.: Rubin: Nothing changes. Motorola remains a separate business. This is about "protecting the 
ecosystem, and extending it as well." 
8:52 a.m.: Q: What about Federal Trade Commission and other regulators? Also, were there other bidders? 
8:53 a.m.: Drummond: Obviously we'll need regulatory sign-off in the U.S., Europe and maybe elsewhere. "We 
believe this is a pro-competitive transaction." Android has added competition and user choice, and so "protecting 
that ecosystem" is pro-consumer "almost by definition." 
8:54 a.m.: We'll have details on the transaction via public filings shortly. 
8:55 a.m.: Q: Legal ramifications pre- and post-deal, especially with regard to existing lawsuits? Also, why is this 
an all-cash deal? 
8:55 a.m.: Drummond: Motorola will continue to manage patents before deal. We won't talk about post-acquisition 
strategy today, but "we obviously feel we'll be in a good position to protect the ecosystem." 
8:56 a.m.: Pichette: We think it's a great deal. 
8:56 a.m.: Q: I know you don't want to talk about legal strategies, but talk about the business model issues with 
regard to partners. How do you keep a level playing field? 
8:57 a.m.: Page: We've been very successful with Android because we've worked with lots of partners. We'll keep 
doing that. 
8:57 a.m.: Rubin: Every year we pick a lead partner to work with on a device. We don't expect that to change at 
all. Motorola will be part of that bidding process, run as a separate company. 
Q: How does this alter the ability to make a living-room move, given Motorola's set-top business? Also, how does 
this affect Oracle Corp. (ORCL) wrangling? 
A: Page. "We're really excited" to work with MMI's home business. 
Jha: Big convergence happening between set-top and mobile. We're very excited about that. 
Drummond: Nothing more to add about Oracle. 
9 a.m.: Q: How aggressively will you look to acquire more patents after this deal? 
Drummond: We've said we need to build a patent portfolio. So we'll continue to do that. 
9:01 a.m.: Closing remarks from Larry. "We are really excited about this whole business." "We at Google are very 
excited." Tremendous opportunity. "We're very excited." Plays up home devices business, too. 
Call is over.

By Kara Swisher 
Of ALL THINGS DIGITAL 
With the entry of Google Inc. (GOOG) into the handset-making market, the search giant has declared a number of 
things, most especially that its own future is all about mobile. 
With the $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI), the struggling but iconic maker of 
mobile devices, Google has put a huge stake in the ground in this highly competitive market and shaken up the 
entire ecosystem. 
A lot of this is about patents, as Google CEO Larry Page said in his blog post about the megadeal Monday 
morning, and about acquiring a bigger portfolio that Google has long sought unsuccessfully for its Android mobile 
operating system, despite onerous efforts. 
But the dramatic acquisition by Google is also a declaration that mobile is more important to it than the skein of 
alliances it has built for Android with phone makers worldwide as part of its objective of making it the dominant 
mobile platform for smartphones and tablets globally. 
While Google has been reaching out to other hardware partners to assure them, and has said they all will remain 
the same in Android-land, the large mobile manufacturers who have placed their trust in Google--especially 
Samsung Electronics Co. (SSNHY, 005930.SE) and HTC Corp. (HTCXF, 2498.TW)--have to be wondering what 
to do now. 
Make no mistake--they already resent Google from time to time, the way Compaq or Dell (DELL) has resented 
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) in the PC business. 
But since Google already showed favoritism to Motorola by letting them do the first Honeycomb tablet, the Xoom 
(although it didn't do any good), that discomfort will only increase now. 
While Google managed to get the partners into lockstep on today's announcement, with a whole web page titled 
"Quotes From Android Partners," each of them using the exact same phrase "defending Android" in their quotes 
feels a little like they are victims of Stockholm syndrome. 
Yes, we concur with everything the Borg tells us to! Defending! Android! We're Droids too! (Calling Patty Hearst 
stat!) 
The impact on everyone--from Microsoft and its partner Nokia (NOK) to Apple (AAPL) to Research in Motion Ltd. 
(RIMM) and also to all the wireless carriers--will be felt immediately. 
And, of course, by government regulators, who have watched warily as Google has marched into business after 
adjacent business to its core search one. 
This deal, which will require approval, is sure to even further put all of Google's businesses in the crosshairs of 
rivals, who will agitate for investigations.

While Android has been conceived at Google as an "autonomous unit" within the company--run by longtime 
mobile vet Andy Rubin--it has now entered a new and perhaps dangerous phase for all involved. 
Because while such a union is not uncommon in the mobile business -- Apple and RIM do software and hardware 
together and Google has released its own Nexus phone (made by others) -- no one has done it via acquisition 
and in such a definitive way. 
And what an acquisition it is. Or, perhaps more accurately, could be.

By Shira Ovide 
Our first thought when Google announced a $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility: Holy cow. Google 
wants to be Apple. 
Instead of visualizing Google CEO Larry Page in a Steve Jobs black turtleneck, think of Google's biggest ever 
deal as a shield against lawyers. 
Yes, Apple's success with the iPod, iPhone and iPad prove the benefits of tightly meshing together easy-to-use 
hardware and software. Google has so far done the opposite with its Android software for phones: let anyone who 
wants to make the hardware license the Android software. Free will! 
But in theory, Google could go the Apple vertical route if it clinches ownership of Motorola Mobility and its 
phones, tablet computers and TV set top boxes. And that may eventually happen. 
For now, though, Google says it doesn't want to do that. The company said it plans to operate Motorola as a 
separate company, which of course is a plan that is less likely to annoy the phone-handset makers that have 
been Google's partners in making Android phones, and will be partner-competitors by virtue of Google's 
ownership of Motorola Mobility. 
But we'll take Google at its word. What it really wants out of Motorola Mobility is its guts: the patents. 
The word "patent" was mentioned 24 times on Google's conference call this morning to discuss the Motorola 
Mobility deal. Over and over, Google newbie CEO Larry Page and other executives talked about how Motorola 
Mobility's portfolio of thousands of patents will help protect Google and its Android phone software from 
"anti-competitive threats" from Microsoft, Apple and other companies. 
Remember that Google lost out to Apple, Microsoft and others in an auction of a patent trove owned by failed 
Canadian telecom firm Nortel for Nortel Networks. Google has sounded harsher and harsher notes -- particularly 
against old rival Microsoft -- over their recent maneuvers in intellectual property auctions. 
Microsoft, Apple and Oracle have sued Android licensees HTC, Motorola and Google iteself over allegations of 
intellectual property violations. Google's top lawyer David Drummond has called the lawsuits "hostile organized 
campaign against Android by Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other companies, waged through bogus patents." 
Drummond and other Google executives wouldn't talk about the litigation in today's conference call. But 
Drummond did refer to having Motorola's patent portfolio to "protect the ecosystem" of the Android software. Wall 
Street seems to approve, even if $12.5 billion seems a steep pricetag for a shield against lawsuits. 
"The big thing it plugs for Google is: Google's patent portfolio is only a few thousand, and they have been the 
target of a significant amount of patent litigation," Evercore Partners analyst Alkesh Shah said. "Motorola's patent 
portfolio provides a very strong defense against all this litigation."

Update 8:29. Adds comment from Google CEO Larry Page and premarket quotes for RIMM and Nolia. 
NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- In a surprise deal, Google has agreed to buy Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, two 
companies said Monday. 
Google is paying $40 a share for Motorola Mobility Holdings, a premium of 63% over its closing price on Friday. 
Google said that access to Motorola, which makes phones that run on Google's Android mobile operating system, 
will "enable Google to supercharge the Android ecosystem and will enhance competition in mobile computing." 
"Motorola Mobility's total commitment to Android has created a natural fit for our two companies," said Google 
Chief Executive Larry Page in a press release. 
Google's stock fell about 3% in premarket trading while Motorola's rose more than 60%. 
Motorola, like BlackBerry maker Research in Motion and Finnish smartphone company Nokia, have all struggled 
to keep pace with Apple, the maker of the popular iPhone. 
Nokia's stock jumped more than 7% in premarket trading and RIM was up 4%. Apple was little changed. 
Motorola Mobility began trading as a separate company earlier this year. The company split from Motorola 
Solutions, which makes telecom equipment for public safety use.

RICHARD QUEST, CNN ANCHOR, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Google says, hello, Moto; and ups the ante 
against Apple and the iPhone. 
We have problems, but they are manageable. President Obama intends to limit debt and deficit worries. 
And the chief executive of Estee Lauder says, lots of promise in the make-up business. 
A new week, I'm Richard Quest. I mean business. 
Good evening. 
Google is turning the mobile phone world upside down, effectively making old Android partners its new rival. It is 
buying Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion. Not only does Google make the world's most popular smart phone 
software, now it will be able to make its own hardware to run it on, too. 
Join me in the library and we will go into some detail, exactly how this deal comes together. For Google it is the 
biggest acquisition of the company to date. Now the second biggest for Google was Double Click for 3.1 billion in 
2007. The Motorola deal is subject, of course, to regulatory approval. But at $12.5 billion for Motorola, the Mobility 
deal is sizeable. The price it is paying, it is a 63 percent share price for Mobility. 
Now, talking about Motorola Mobility, Motorola split into two last year. Motorola phones, tablets set top boxes, 
and Motorola, of course, the Solutions Networking. The company couldn't maintain the impetus of its popular 
phones. Now, many of you will recognize this one. This was the old time port, the first tri-band phone, for 
trans-Atlantic users. And then, of course, you had the Razor phones, in its various, different guises. Well, 
Motorola had real constructive gains and leads with these models, which they, frankly, didn't manage to quantify. 
So, Android came along. Motorola is to be a separate unit. The Droid, according to Larry Page, now he says, the 
`Droid will be run within Motorola, as a separate division of Google Open Platform. We'll run Motorola as a 
separate business. But it won't be that simple, as you can see from here. 
Because at the moment you have Motorola and you have Google. Now, this is the hardware. That is the software. 
Put them together, and you end up, supposedly, with something that will be bigger and better. But similar deals 
are being done elsewhere. For instance, this is Nokia with Microsoft. This is what the Nokia phones look like 
running the Windows 7. You have Nokia, you have Windows, and again, you have the two coming together, 
software, and hardware. Similarly, to an extent, HP; HP bought WebOS, the old PALM. It is running the two 
things, hardware and software. Move along to Blackberry and you really do wonder, what is Blackberry going to 
do with its own solutions. It's hardware and the software, but frankly that is being somewhat left behind. The 
daddy of them all, is the Apple iPhone, which everybody aims to beat. 
But these are the chaps and the chapesses (sic), who perhaps have got some real problems. Sony Ericsson, LG, 
Samsung, HTC. Where do they fit into this whole problem, and this whole equation? 
Let's join and talk more about this. Richard Windsor is the global technology marketing analyst at Nomura 
Securities. Richard joins me from Dubai. 
What are Google playing at? They are effectively getting into bed with one of the manufacturers to the detriment 
of the others. 
RICHARD WINDSOR, NOMURA SECURITIES: That is exactly what it looks like on the surface. What we suspect 
is actually going on here is that the rest of the manufacturers in the Android community actually need a lot of 
patent protection. And actually this deal is most likely to be about the patents that Motorola has. And in fact, what

Page 107 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
we suspect will happen in maybe six to months to one year's time, is Google will probably divest the hardware 
business, the handset business and the set top box business, because frankly, it is not core to what we think its 
core strategy is. 
QUEST: Whoa! Whoa! What you are saying is, cherry picking. They've gone after the patents and the software, 
basically keeping the software. And they really don't care who makes the boxes? 
WINDSOR: That would seem to be it. The issue, really, is here is that Motorola has 17,000 patents that it has filed 
all the way through the creation of wireless standards. And the problem is, is that the Android community at the 
moment is largely made up of the Asian players, HTC, ZTE and Samsung. And these guys really need patent 
protection because what you have seen is that the likes of Microsoft and Apple are going after the Android 
community by suing them for infringement of their patents to try and limit their success of the Android community. 
QUEST: But if you-but, Richard, if we look, you have Motorola and Google. And you have got Nokia with 
Windows 7. This coming together of software and hardware, at the same time as you have these Asiatic 
companies, is this a deliberate blurring of the lines? 
WINDSOR: Well, the thing is, what is actually happening is, is that arguably it is better for hardware and software 
to be fully vertically integrated. That is what Apple has actually shown. But the problem you've got here is that if 
Google persists in that strategy and really puts all of its weight behind Motorola and kind of, in a way, cuts HTC, 
cuts Samsung, cut ZTE, they cut them loose. You actually run the risk of collapsing the entire Android community, 
because right now, it is the HTC, Samsung, and ZTE phones that are really selling in volumes. 
QUEST: All right. 
Can we learn from all of this-and I've got in my hand, as you might be able to see, the Time Port and the Razor, 
two phones of which I'm sure you are familiar. But don't we really learn from all of this, that just because you are 
popular today, as with Nokia, as with PALM, as with Blackberry, it doesn't meant to say that you stand a hope in 
hell's chance of still being popular this time in two years. 
WINDSOR: I think that is absolutely correct. The real question at the moment is, is at the moment it is all about 
cool applications. It is all about a great looking user interface, touch screens. The answer is, you know, what 
happens in two year's time, is that what users actually want from a mobile device may change significantly. And it 
is quite possible that whatever that change is, Apple might miss it. And the balance of power may shift yet again. 
That is entirely possible. 
QUEST: Fascinating stuff. Richard, thank you very much coming in late, in Dubai, we appreciate your time. 
Richard Windsor joining me from Nomura, in Dubai. 
After the break, Barack Obama is packing up his economic troubles. He's on the road, we will hear what the 
president has to say as he tours the American Midwest. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, good evening. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
QUEST: While leaders are trying to put last week's market convulsions firmly behind them, and prove that they 
have the remedy for the global economies chronic pains. Barack Obama is on a tour of the American Midwest, 
crucial electoral heartland in all of this. The president says it is a listening tour and he's not due to make any big 
economic announcements. When the president spoke a short time ago in Minnesota he appealed for an end of 
the political gridlock, again, which took America to the brink of default. 
(DESK BELL CHIMES) 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There is nothing that we're facing that we can't solve 
with some spirit of America first; a willingness to say we're going to choose party-we're going to choose country 
over party, we're going to choose the next generation over the next election. 
(APPLAUSE) 
If we are willing to do that, then I have absolutely no doubt that we can get this economy going again. That we 
can get people working back again, small businesses can start growing again.

QUEST: Barack Obama, in the Midwest, where he is on the bus (ph). 
(DESK BELL CHIMES) 
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy is on travels of his own. He meets with the German Chancellor Angela 
Merkel on Tuesday, a summit. They will be talking about how better to govern the Eurozone. Apparently they will 
not be talking about a euro bond. On Thursday we will hear how French ministers plan to save more money. Mr. 
Sarkozy has given them a week to come up with fresh ideas to cut the French deficit. He wants to stop rumors 
that France could loose its AAA credit rating. 
(DESK BELL CHIMES) 
Nina Dos Santos is in Paris, joins me tonight. 
So, if they are not talking about the euro bond, and they are probably not talking about anything that might 
actually accentuate a rift between them, what would be the core of their discussions? 
NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that is the $64,000 question now really, 
Richard, isn't it, here in Paris. What we do know is that whatever they say is crucial to this, the euro, the common 
currency, 17 nations share this currency. It is their money in the European Union region, some 320 million people. 
And really, this is being bill, at the moment, Richard, as the make or break summit for the euro, as yet, it is 
unclear exactly what they are going to be discussing. 
What we could see, some economists here have been telling me, is that we could see some kind of agreement 
for Eurozone leaders to come together more often and to speak more often and coordinate their economic policy. 
Of course, that is one of the reasons why the bond market have been giving Eurozone leaders such a tough time 
over the last 18 months. Is because we have a monetary union, but we don't have a fiscal one. 
QUEST: All right. All right. 
July 21, European summit, Eurozone summit, that sets out the regulations for an expanded and strengthened 
stability facility. Are they likely to either, reaffirm or enhance that, or is it also possible they will move forward, 
really give the idea of fiscal union a push? 
DOS SANTOS: Well, it seems, if you read some of the literature on this matter, but obviously, you know, it does 
change depending on who you speak to, as well. And it is changing rapidly, this picture as well. As of course, the 
bond market starts to price in some kind of fiscal union it seems as though Angela Merkel may, according to 
some German newspapers, be softening in her stance of a kind of fiscal union. 
You mention euro bonds. Now, the markets are saying, increasingly, talk among you politicians is cheap. We 
want to see action. 
QUEST: Right. 
DOS SANTOS: What they want to see is euro bonds issued and backed by 17 nations and they say that that will 
calm the debt markets. But the Germans are saying, we will not give that unless we have fiscal union as well. And 
that could be further down the road. 
QUEST: Finally, how significant is it that they have chosen to have this meeting in the middle of-or the back end 
of August, when frankly, anybody who is anybody in France would normally be on the Riviera. 
DOS SANTOS: I can tell you that most people behind me, on the Champs- Elysees, in fact are probably on the 
Riviera. Paris is absolutely deserted at the moment. It is a public holiday today, across much of continental 
Europe. 
And that is one of the reasons why it is so significant. France, we have got to remember, we knew on Friday, flat 
lined in terms of its growth. France became the latest Eurozone country to incur the wrath of the bond market. 
Who already started, Richard, pricing in a downgrade for its debt. Now, what this means, is if France were to get 
a downgrade-and we must stress that all of the ratings agencies have said for the moment they confident with 
their outlook on French debt, they're not earmarking it for a downgrade. But if France were to get a downgrade 
that would mean that the onus of putting more money into that European stability fund, the ESFS, would come 
onto, for instance, Germany and some of the other countries that were AAA if France were to loose its AAA 
rating. That is why it is so significant. That is why it is happening tomorrow.

QUEST: Nina Dos Santos who is in Paris, and with all those empty streets will be able to get a decent table for 
dinner. Nina Dos Santos, from Paris. 
Barack Obama is heading to Iowa for his second town hall meeting of the day. Part of a three-day tour of the 
Midwest that we were hearing about earlier. Brianna Keilar is traveling with the president and sent this dispatch. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (On camera): Here in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, 
the first of five stops the president will make in the Midwest over the next three days. The president was very 
quick to skewer the political climate in Washington, that delivered the bruising debt deal. He didn't call out 
Republicans by name, but it was very clear who he was criticizing. While the White House is insistent that this is 
not a series of campaign stops, the president took aim at almost everyone in the Republican presidential field. 
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You know the debate the other party candidates 
were having the other day, when they were asked, to reduce our deficit, reduce our debt, would you be willing to 
take a deal where it was $5 of spending cuts for every $1 of increased revenues. Who would take it? Everybody 
said, no. They said how about $10 to $1; $10 in cuts for every $1 increase in revenue. 
Are you saying that none of you would take it? And everybody raised their hand. None of them would take it. 
Think about that. I mean that is just not common sense. 
KEILAR: The president has faced a lot of criticism from Republicans for this bus tour. Some calling it a no-jobs 
tour, other saying it is a campaign stunt. But the White House says it is very important for President Obama to 
come out, listen to Americans, listen to their concerns, get some ideas. And we didn't hear any new specific jobs 
proposals. Just ones that he has been touting recently, extending unemployment benefits, extending the payroll 
tax cut, an infrastructure bank to increase infrastructure spending. But White House officials say the president will 
be rolling out some new jobs proposals in the coming weeks. Brianna Keilar, CNN, Cannon Falls, Minnesota. 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
QUEST: After the extraordinary events of last week, I'm sure you are as exhausted as the rest of us are, the way 
the market seesawed. Do you know we had seven days, which is the first time in history, apparently, where you 
had an up, down, up, down, session over the last week, and a bit. And then, of course, we had the four days of 
400-point moves. You will be perhaps a little bit relieved, chance to take a breath. 
(DESK BELL CHIMES) 
QUEST: The Dow is up 162 points. We are comfortably over 11,000- well, I say, comfortably, but you know as 
well as I do, that what is comfortable one day can be most uncomfortable the next. Up 1.5 percent, at 11,432. 
Let's make sure it stays that way for the rest of the hour. 
In a moment, "Future Cities" and there are difficult choices in Lebanon's capital city. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
QUEST (On camera): Building the Beirut of the future and deciding which buildings to keep, after the break. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
QUEST: This month on "Future Cities" we are in Beirut. It used to be called Paris of the Middle East. Now, five 
years after the war with Israel ended, there were still home-grown troubles which are threatening the stability of 
the country. For instance, just last Thursday two men were killed in a Beiruti suburb, when a bomb exploded. It is 
ongoing incidences like this that make it much more difficult for Lebanon to attract much needed investment. 
Even so, perhaps, despite of this, construction in the capital steams ahead. And as construction continues, there 
are concerns that historic buildings, that define the country, won't be a part of the city's future. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
MONA HALLAK, ARCHITECT, PRESERVATIONIST: I can paint this famous building because it really right in the 
center of the history of Beirut. Architecturally it is a pioneering example avant-garde architecture. Historically it 
summarizes the beauty of living in Beirut before the war. And it summarizes the fight to preserve Beirut's heritage.

Page 110 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
QUEST (voice over): The yellow house is at the heart of the debate over Beirut's future. Modernize and change, 
or preserve and restore. This particular building was a sniper's nest during Lebanon's civil war. The imposing 
bullet ridden facades stand as a monument to both the beautiful and the blood turns of Beirut's history. 
HALLAK: In 1975 life stopped, abruptly. The war came. The war just abused every single place in the city. And 
this was abused equally. This became a killing machine. 
From this room three different snipers, you can see the traces of the bullets right here. For me this is a monument 
to the civil war. This is real. I think this is what we need in the city. 
QUEST: Ever since the civil war ended real estate in Beirut has been booming. Along with many damaged 
buildings developers wanted to tear down the yellow house and replace it with a tower. Saving this building has 
taken the architect Mona Hallak 13 years. This is just one of hundreds of heritage buildings in Beirut. 
Elsewhere in the city, construction frenzy continues upwards undeterred. 
(On camera): I can see at least 10 cranes from this balcony. A testament to the amount of building taking place in 
the Lebanese capital, the problem and the fear is many of the traditional buildings are being knocked down and 
replaced by tall look alike, me-too buildings. 
NABIL GHOLAM, ARCHITECT AND URBAN PLANNER: I think it is a mixed blame. I think we have to take some 
of the blame, as architects, the public, in general, who doesn't stand for what they believe in, and a government 
that represents the public, which hasn't been able, in the last 20 years, since the war is over, pretty much, to set 
up proper protection system and we are loosing whatever is left very fast. 
HALLAK: Five years ago this was an intact heritage cluster. There was an old building there, now it is a tower 
under construction. Simply this is not a cluster anymore. The city of Beirut will look like Dubai in six year's time if 
we continue like this. 
QUEST (on camera): As you walk around the city you soon discover that some of the older beautiful buildings are 
now dwarfed by much larger tower blocks that are seemingly out of proportion to the local neighborhood. 
(Voice over): One area that does have proper planning is Beirut's downtown. Destroyed by the war, it was rebuild 
by the developer Solidere, a company especially established for the purpose. Solidere has restored several of the 
city's traditional buildings. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is a neo-Arabesque. This is the real thing. It is not some kind of pastiche. These are real 
buildings. They have been restored. And it is one of the main central streets of the historic core. 
QUEST: The city's mayor points out, elsewhere in Beirut, beyond the confines of Solidere's land, even less has 
survived. 
MAYOR BILAL HAMAD, BEIRUT: This is one of the reasons why I wanted to come to this office, and to this chair. 
What we are doing now, anybody who wants a permit to bring down, to destroy and old building, before coming to 
(UNINTELLIGIBLE), they go to the Ministry Of Culture. If they think that building should be classified, they won't 
give the permit. So this way we can, a little bit, control the destruction of heritage buildings all around Beirut. 
QUEST (voice over): Activists like Hallak are not waiting for new laws to save old buildings. Accustomed to long 
periods of political turmoil, she says in today's Beirut, it is down to individuals, and not governments to fight for the 
survival of the city's identity. 
HALLAK: It is going to become the museum of memory of the City of Beirut. This will be a place where people 
learn about the city, and maybe learn to respect it more, love it more, and protect it more. 
QUEST: For now, this is one building that has found new life in Beirut's future. 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
QUEST: And we will be in Beirut for the rest of August, everyone there, of course, as "Future Cities" continues. 
After the break, America threw billions of dollars at its economy. And still, this summertime, making a living is far 
from easy. We'll be talking to the former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich, whether the U.S. stimulus can 
deliver jobs, and whether more is needed.

(DESK BELL CHIMES) 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. 
This is CNN. And on this network, the news always comes first. 
Regional pressure is increasing for Syria to end its crackdown on dissent. Pictures like these emerged described 
online as Syrian gunships shelling one of their own cities. Turkey has repeated demands that Syrian President 
Bashar al-Assad stop the violence immediate and that the Syrian people's democratic demands be met. 
Mixed reaction to a judge's decision to ban TV cameras from the trial of the former Egyptian leader, Hosni 
Mubarak. Some say it will help maintain objectivity. Others worry about transparency. The trial has been 
adjourned until September the 5th, while officials consider evidence. 
After a string of deadly attacks across Iraqi cities, the prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, is asking security forces not 
to let the killers catch their breath and to pursue until they're finished. At least 75 people lost their lives on Monday 
half of them in a double bombing in Kut. 
Barack Obama has embarked on a three day bus tour through the American Midwest. The White House says he'll 
be talking about job growth in rural communities. Some Republicans are mocking the tour as a thinly disguised 
campaign trip. One called it a magical mystery tour. 
Now, with markets fluctuating and fears of a double dip recession, questions are being asked about whether the 
original American stimulus package actually worked, whether more now needs to be done and just how damaged 
is Barack Obama as his approval rating slips below 40 percent. At this sort of level, is he not in serious trouble? 
Joining me now is the former U.S. Labor secretary and the public policy professor, Robert Reich. 
He joins me from the University of California at Berkeley. 
Dr. Reich is also the author of "Aftershock," the book, which is now available in paperback. 
We start with the politics, Mr. Reich, and then we'll go to -- to economics, because politics, at the moment, seems 
sexier than economics, although that's maybe not always the case after last week. 
But let's just start. How -- how worried should Barack Obama be that his -- his approval rating is now under 40 
percent? 
ROBERT REICH, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, FORMER U.S. LABOR SECRETARY: Richard, any president 
should be very, very concerned, going into an election year, whose approval rating is under 40 percent. This does 
not spell, necessarily, a victory, although the odds that a sitting president will be reelected are quite good, if you 
look at American history. 
But the odds get much, much lower if the economy is very bad and people are pessimistic. 
QUEST: Right. 
REICH: Consumer confidence right now is at a low, almost a record low. 
QUEST: So to the extent that, and particularly if we look at the Republican contenders, who do seem to be very 
much right-wing, very much conservative, and, to some extent, if it plays out as it seems -- and I understand, sir, 
we're a long way. But there will be a very stark, divisive choice. 
REICH: Yes, there will be. I mean Republicans have really, in the last 90 years, if you go back in American 
history, have basically promoted one fundamental idea and that is that government is bad, government needs to 
get out of the way, everything would be better with less government. Ronald Reagan was the major progenitor of 
this view, but it really predated him. It goes back to Herbert Hoover, Calvin Coolidge. 
And that is exactly what today's Republicans are saying -- all of our problems, all of our anxieties, the bad 
economy is all due to government. This is very different from the Democratic and very difficult from the Obama 
administration's view.

Page 112 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
QUEST: Except -- OK, so we're in this scenario. We've got growth numbers in France non-existent, growth 
numbers in Britain verging on recession, growth numbers in the United States stagnant, unemployment high. 
Are you in favor, Professor, of a straightforward another bout of fiscal stimulus and QE3 monetary stimulus? 
REICH: Well, as John Maynard Keynes, John Maynard Keynes, the great British economist, told us and 
instructed us and actually we followed for about 40 years, when the private sector cannot do it... 
QUEST: Right. 
REICH: -- that is, when consumers cannot buy, when businesses will not hire because consumers are not out 
there, then government has got to be the purchaser of last resort. And that means, yes, rather than a politics of 
austerity, we need now expansion and expansive fiscal and monetary policies, not only in the United States, but 
in Europe. In fact, historians will look back right now on what Europe is doing and what the United States is doing 
in terms of contractionary policies and say they were crazy. 
QUEST: Is what's happening, the austerity measures, do you see any similarities between what happens now 
and what happened in the 1920s and 30s, where they did make very similar contractory -- contraction efforts 
instead of expanding the economies, which ultimately led to the Great Depression? 
Are there similarities or am I barking up the wrong tree? 
REICH: Well, the biggest similarity is 1936-1937, when, in the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who actually, 
his expansionary fiscal and monetary policies was -- were beginning to lead us out of the trough of the recession, 
which hit its bottom in 1933. Then he pulled back in 1936 and 1937. His advisers said, no, we cannot, we have to 
balance the budget, we've got to cut spending. Also, the Federal Reserve Board, our monetary authority... 
QUEST: Right. 
REICH: -- pulled back on the monetary -- the money supply. 
And then in 1937, what happened? 
The United States economy sunk way back into depression once again. 
QUEST: All right... 
REICH: And that is the danger right now. 
QUEST: To those who would say, watching this program tonight, who would say, Robert Reich is a Democrat 
who's never seen a government program and a government spending program that he didn't like or wanted to 
spend more money on, what would you say? 
REICH: Well, I'd say two things. Number one, when I was part of the Clinton administration, we actually did cut 
spending. I took a -- my own department, I went from 20,000 employees down to 16,000 employees. But that was 
a particular point in time in which the government and the economy -- the economy was expanding. So 
government could pull back. 
When the economy is contracting, you won't -- you need government to expand. And again, anybody watching 
this program who doubts this has only to look at history. The stimulus program that the Obama administration 
embarked on was not nearly large enough given that state and local governments in the United States were 
cutting like mad, pulling back, at the same time, almost negating the stimulus, and given, also, that the falloff... 
QUEST: So -- so... 
REICH: -- in demand was much larger than anybody had assumed. 
QUEST: All right. So if debt to GDP in the U.S. is already heading to 100 percent, 92 percent or whatever it is by 
some measures, what pre -- what number are you prepared to let it rise to as you continue to fund a stimulus 
package? 
REICH: Well, Richard, remember -- and you said it very well just now -- the debt to GDP is the critical point. So if 
we grow the GDP, if we get growth back... 
QUEST: Oh...

Page 113 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
REICH: -- that debt/GDP ratio actually starts declining. So we need to stimulate the economy in order to get 
growth back. If the private sector cannot do it, remember, consumers here and consumers, indeed, in Europe, 
also, are burdened with debt, are scared about the future, their jobs are declining, their wages are declining. In 
these circumstances, government has got to stimulate growth so that the debt/GDP ratio, three or four or five 
years from now, actually comes down. Otherwise, we're in very, very serious trouble. 
QUEST: We're now -- but it comes to the final question, because we're back to politics, really. The choice -- and I 
come back to this idea that, I mean, perhaps not since the last the election or (INAUDIBLE), the choice the 
American people are going to have next year will be one of the starkest that perhaps either of us can remember, 
between those on the left and those on the right, particularly if we end up with a -- a more right-wing Republican 
nominee like Perry or Michelle Bachmann. 
REICH: Well, yes. It looks like it's going to be a very stark choice. But what -- what irks a little bit, I have to be 
completely frank with you, Richard, is that in the American media and in the world media, the assumption is that 
the truth lies about halfway between what is correct and what is incorrect. I mean I the economics profession, 
among economic policy people, among people who have expertise in government and politics, there is almost no 
doubt that we need, right now... 
QUEST: All right... 
REICH: -- to have more stimulus. This is not something that is a fringe idea. Keynesianism was the backbone of 
American policy. 
QUEST: All right. 
REICH: And over the last eight recessions, indeed, if you look at... 
QUEST: All right... 
REICH: -- the Great Depression, it worked. 
QUEST: We'll have to leave it there before the satellite finishes. You and I could talk much more and hopefully we 
will, in the future. 
Mr. Robert Reich joining us from California. 
The markets -- how are they trading? 
After last week, anything, a bit of -- I don't know whether I actually want a robust upwards session or just a bit of 
peace and quiet this week. 
Alison Kosik is in New York. 
As we come toward the end of the summertime in the -- for New Yorkers, what do you prefer, a quiet session or a 
robust, rapacious session? 
ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: I -- I think I'll go for quiet after what happened last week. 
And -- and, you know, we are having a nice quiet session to the up side, as you can see. You know, the Dow 
holding onto its gains, up 161 points. And what's interesting is that Wall Street is shrugging off a really downbeat 
manufacturing report. It was the Empire State Manufacturing Index. It missed by a long shot. The survey showed 
that -- that manufacturing fell deeper into negative territory in August, mentioning manufacturing activity in the 
New York area contracted for a third straight month. 
But investors are looking past it today, Richard. They're looking at some deal news, especially after companies 
have been hoarding cash, with -- with such uncertainty in this economic climate, that the fact that they're putting 
their cash to work is that they public opinion -- is a big positive. For one, Google has signed Motorola Mobility for 
$12.5 billion. Shares of MMI are surging 55 percent. 
Also, Bank of America is selling its Canadian credit card business. That's giving a boost to BOA's searches, up 
more than 8 percent. In fact, BOA is leading the Dow. 
Also, an accusation by offshore driller, Transocean, that's boosting the gains, as well. But as you know this, 
Richard, three days of gains do not make a trend. So we will see how the day ends...

Page 114 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
QUEST: Yes. 
KOSIK: -- and tomorrow is also a new day for (INAUDIBLE)... 
QUEST: I... 
KOSIK: -- (INAUDIBLE). 
QUEST: I disagree with you, Miss. Kosik. After last week, two hours... 
KOSIK: With what? 
QUEST: -- two hours of the Dow going in one direction is a trend after what we saw last week. You're right, we've 
got to have a few more days before (INAUDIBLE). 
KOSIK: We do. 
QUEST: Alison Kosik is in New York tonight. 
After the break, the managing director of the World Bank, the assistant manager is leaving her post. I'll have an 
interview with Ngozi after the break. And we'll find out why she thinks of the world's poor are better off than they 
used to be. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
QUEST: Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is the managing director at the World Bank. That is, until tomorrow -- well, pretty 
much tonight. 
She's about to return to her former role as Nigeria's finance minister. 
On her last day at the World Bank, she joined me from Washington -- always good to have Ngozi on the program 
-- to discuss major issues of development aid. 
And with all the policies that have been put in place on her watch, the core question, whether the world's poorest 
are now in a more secure place? 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
NGOZI OKONJO-IWEALA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WORLD BANK: The world global environment is now so full 
of uncertainties that we cannot be totally complacent, that the 44 million people who were thrown into poverty with 
the food crisis are now in a better place. 
I think we have to continue to be vigilant because we've got the food crisis, we've got the global financial crisis 
that you referred to. And we -- we -- all of them serve to make it very important that the global community 
continues to look at the situation of the poor people around the globe. 
QUEST: Do you leave your job with a feeling that you have made a difference or that you have merely made a 
dent? 
OKONJO-IWEALA: That's a very tough question. You know, I think it's easier for other people to judge whether 
one has made a difference or not. 
But let me say this. I've had a wonderful time at the World Bank. I've been very privileged to be able to do that 
job, as I'm very privileged to be asked to go back to my own home to help. And let me tell you, there are a few 
things I think, you know, I'm proud of, that where the World Bank has made a difference with -- and where I think 
I've contributed. 
The first is that during the 2008-2009 food crisis, we were able to put together a fund of $1.2 billion that, you 
know, helped the poorest -- the 79 poorest countries in the world to weather the food crisis. And financial crisis, 
the World Bank has been very active. I also contributed to that, in helping countries with policies and financing to 
make their way through the crisis. 
QUEST: Time for you to get angry, though.

Page 115 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Are you angry at the way in which the world is still geared and the policies of G-20, G-7, are still geared to 
developed world and skewed toward the rich? 
OKONJO-IWEALA: Of course I'm angry that in today's world -- or I'm -- I'm upset that we still have a billion people 
who go to bed hungry and that we still have a situation like famine in the Horn of Africa, when we have a world 
that is perfectly capable of dealing with these problems. 
So, yes, I -- I would feel better if the world would have the political will to deal with the security situation in the 
Horn of Africa so that we can help them with long-term solutions to food and food security. I would feel better if 
the G-20 could also focus on the problems of low income countries. 
But let me tell you, the world is becoming more and more multi-polar. It is the emerging market countries that are 
contributing a lot more to global growth now. And some of the low income countries like the countries on the 
African continent, are not doing badly. They are growing at better than 5 percent. 
QUEST: Right. 
OKONJO-IWEALA: So we should also look on them as contributors to global growth. 
QUEST: Now, Ngozi is returning to Nigeria, where she will take up the post of finance minister and coordinating 
minister for the economy. 
And we'll hear from her tomorrow on exactly what she hopes to do in a job that she previously already held. 
Does she think there is still differences that she can make back home? 
When we come back after the break, some pretty profits were unveiled today, it was the cosmetics from Estee 
Lauder. An exclusive interview with the chief executive, Fabrizio Freda, coming up. 
QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. 
Good evening. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
QUEST: Maybe not the reversal session, but it wasn't a bad one, either. 
Shares in the cosmetics giant, Estee Lauder, fell 7 percent on Monday after it made a conservative forecast for its 
2012 fiscal year. 
Now, it's been a successful year so far this one. The company announced fourth quarter earnings of $41 million. 
That was up 72 percent. 
That's rather good, that 72. 
In a television exclusive, Estee Lauder's chief exec Fabrizio Freda told our very own Felicia Taylor how new 
products and new markets are giving sales a boost. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
FELICIA TAYLOR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Here we are at Estee Lauder headquarters in New York on Fifth 
Avenue with the CEO, Fabrizio Freda, after having just reported record sales for the company. 
One of the leading products is Advanced Night Repair. 
Tell me why this is so special and where the growth is. 
FABRIZIO FREDA, CEO, ESTEE LAUDER: It is so special because, first of all, it's a great technology and it's a 
base product -- the core product for the routine of every woman around the world, but particularly in China. A lot 
of Chinese women are really liking this product. They call it the brown bottle. 
TAYLOR: And it is. 
But what about growth in China?

Page 116 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
I mean, clearly, that's an important region for you going forward. 
What are your expectations down the road? 
FREDA: We will continue to invest in China and grow this market. This making is one of the fastest growing 
markets in the globe. It has a lot of potential for the long-term. Also, Chinese consumers are traveling the world 
and they consume a lot of the products which are winning in mainland China, also during their travel experiences. 
So winning in China actually has a positive effect on the entire business globally. 
TAYLOR: Tell me about the travel arena. I know that's also an important growth area for you, literally, people in 
duty-free arenas buying product, right? 
FREDA: Yes, absolutely. Travel retail is a channel which is growing, and very successfully, around the world. 
People travel more. They spend more time in airports. And importantly, the shopping experience in airports is 
improving. And so there is more and more people buying in travel retail. 
TAYLOR: What about Latin America? 
Where is your greatest growth there? 
FREDA: Our greater growth in Latin America at the moment is on Macau, actually, in the area of Mekab (ph). And 
more to come, particularly in Brazil. 
TAYLOR: What have you done in department stores to help attract customers back to the makeup counter that 
might be different than what we saw in 2008 and 2009? 
FREDA: What we have done is, first of all, we are counting, as I said, a big innovation -- products which are so 
important to consumers that are attracting new users to the store. We support this unique innovation with more 
aggressive advertising, be it in magazines, be it in digital or be it in television. 
So the consumer comes to the store and they find a -- an amazing service quality. And thanks to this quality, we 
can customize the product to their needs and they discover the rest of the line and the brand. 
TAYLOR: Looking forward, though, you have changed your range in terms of the growth outlook. 
Tell me what that is and where -- why you made that change -- the decision. 
FREDA: We -- we have basic -- we assume to continue growing much more than the market. So our assumption 
for the next years is to continue consistently to build market share. 
We are (INAUDIBLE) however, are giving a range to the market out there today, because at the top of the range 
is our continuous growth, as planned. In the bottom of the range, there is the hypothesis that the current turmoil in 
the financial markets will create some softening in consumption. 
I don't know and I'm sure you can guess for me. 
(LAUGHTER) 
TAYLOR: I'm not playing that guessing game for any -- for any amount of money. 
(END VIDEO TAPE) 
QUEST: Felicia Taylor in New York with Estee Lauder. 
I hope they made sure that all the makeup was still there when she left. Well, we know Felicia. 
The weather forecast now. 
Jenny Harrison is at the World Weather Center -- Jenny, there are some rather nasty systems out there at the 
moment. 
JENNY HARRISON, CNN METEOROLOGIST: There are, indeed. Yes. In fact, some heavy rain across portions 
of Europe. I'll come back to that.

Page 117 of 118 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
But I think you're probably referring to Tropical Storm Gert. It's a fairly powerful one. But so far, not really 
producing any problem for any areas of land. 
Now this is it. You can see how (INAUDIBLE) there. It's about 155 kilometers to the east right now. Winds are 
strong, about 90, 93 kilometers an hour. But most of the rain with this storm system is the north and the east of 
the actual formation of the storm. 
So that means right now Bermuda. Unbelievably, maybe, if you're there, it's about 27 Celsius and clear, sunny 
skies. So this system hopefully will pass by with no problems. 
But you can see that it's expected to continue its journey across into the Northern Atlantic. So we'll keep an eye 
on it just to see where it actually comes out to and, if, in fact, it pushes across into any areas of Europe, which 
Europe, which, often, of course, can happen. 
Now, I also want to point out to you this system in the south. This is being given, once again, it's changed, 
actually. It was -- it was originally highlighted there just like that by the National Hurricane Center. Then they 
dropped the box for a day. 
We were still talking about it and sure enough, we are watching it once again. 
But there's certainly plenty of rain across this region of the Caribbean. And that system, whether it develops or 
not, will produce some heavy showers through the Lesser Antilles, as you can see, and then head toward more 
central areas of the Caribbean. 
Now, as I say, across in Europe, we'll keep an eye on the remnants of Gert, which is what it will be by the time it 
reaches this part of the world. But there's been some very heavy rain and thunderstorms again in the last few 
hours. 
Thunderstorms have been cropping up across Eastern Europe. And this line of cloud is all moving along with a 
frontal system. But some very heavy rain in particular has been pushing into Ireland, actually, in the last few 
hours. And some fairly persistent rain around those thunderstorms. I'm afraid that could lead to a little bit more 
flooding across into Scotland, certainly. 
But this is the front I just showed you on the satellite. And that will spread that way eastward. One or two 
warnings in terms of maybe the potential for one or two stronger thunderstorms. You could have some strong 
winds and maybe, as well, some hail in the forecast. You can see all that coming in over the next couple of days. 
Staying fine and dry in the Med. That's where the heat is, particularly into Central and Southern Spain. 
Thirty-eight in Madrid, which, as you know, Richard, is 100 degrees Fahrenheit. 
So lucky you're in London, 21, 70 degrees Fahrenheit. So, not bad. 
QUEST: A quick question. I know -- what -- we're out of time, but a quick question. 
What does hurricane season start? 
HARRISON: Well, we've started. In fact, if Gert... 
QUEST: All right. 
HARRISON: -- doesn't become a hurricane, it will be the seventh tropical storm of the season not to develop into 
a hurricane. And that will be a record. So it started already and it's going to continue through November. But it's 
been a fairly quiet time so far. 
QUEST: Thank you very much. 
I knew you would know the answer. 
You know the old line, I don't know the answer, but I know a woman who does. 
Jenny Harrison. 
A Profitable Moment next.

QUEST: Tonight's Profitable Moment. 
We've seen a new chapter in the ever changing Smartphone ecosystems following the marriages of Nokia and 
Windows, Google and Motorola celebrating their own union of hardware and software. 
Google's purchase may be a protective mood. It's sure to sour relations with existing Android buddies. Overnight, 
from partners to competitors. 
It's a major shift and there's good reason to be wary. It's hard to see how Motorola won't get preferential treatment 
and first dibs on software. Now it's going to be in a circle. 
How will Samsung, HTC, Sony react to being second in the line? 
Of course, unlike Motorola, those rivals are free to jump ship to another operating system if they wish. 
And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. 
I'm Richard Quest in London. 
Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. 
"PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT" is after the headlines.
