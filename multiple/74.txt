LONDON, Dec. 28 /PRNewswire/ -- Carnival (NYSE: CCL) notes the release of P&O Princess' circular to its 
shareholders convening P&O Princess' Extraordinary General Meeting for 14 February 2002. 
Carnival's preliminary review of the P&O Princess shareholder circular and the associated documents on display 
(together the "Documents") confirms its belief that the board of P&O Princess entered into the "poison pill" 
arrangements when it was aware of Carnival's strong interest in P&O Princess, contrary to P&O Princess 
Shareholders' best interests and shareholder value. 
Carnival continues to believe that its Offer is clearly superior to the Royal Caribbean Proposal. 
Carnival and its advisors are reviewing the Documents and will make a full response in due course. 
Terms used in this announcement have the same meaning as in the Announcement dated 16 December 2001. 
The directors of Carnival accept responsibility for the information contained in this announcement. To the best of 
the knowledge and belief of the directors of Carnival (who have taken all reasonable care to ensure such is the 
case), the information contained herein for which they accept responsibility is in accordance with the facts and 
does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
Certain statements in this announcement constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the 
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Carnival has tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements 
by using words such as "anticipate," "assume," "believe," "expect," "intend," "plan" and words and terms of similar 
substance in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. These forward-looking 
statements, including those which may impact the forecasting of Carnival's net revenue yields, booking levels, 
price, occupancy or business prospects, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which 
may cause Carnival's actual results, performances or achievements to be materially different from any future 
results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors 
include, among others, the following: general economic and business conditions which may impact levels of 
disposable income of consumers and the net revenue yields for Carnival's cruise products; consumer demand for

cruises and other vacation options; other vacation industry competition; effects on consumer demand of armed 
conflicts, political instability, terrorism, the availability of air service and adverse media publicity; increases in 
cruise industry and vacation industry capacity; continued availability of attractive port destinations; changes in tax 
laws and regulations; Carnival's ability to implement its shipbuilding program and to continue to expand its 
business outside the North American market; Carnival's ability to attract and retain shipboard crew; changes in 
foreign currency rates, security expenses, food, fuel, insurance and commodity prices and interest rates; delivery 
of new ships on schedule and at the contracted prices; weather patterns; unscheduled ship repairs and 
dry-docking; incidents involving cruise ships; impact of pending or threatened litigation; and changes in laws and 
regulations applicable to Carnival. 
Carnival cautions the reader that these risks may not be exhaustive. Carnival operates in a continually changing 
business environment, and new risks emerge from time to time. Carnival cannot predict such risks nor can it 
assess the impact, if any, of such risks on its business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks may 
cause actual results to differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking 
statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. Carnival undertakes no obligation to 
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or 
otherwise.

P&O Princess Tells Holders to Approve Merger With Royal

P&O Princess Tells Holders to Approve Merger With Royal 
By Anita Raghavan and Martha Brannigan 
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

P&O Princess Cruises PLC strongly recommended that its shareholders approve its planned $3.2 billion merger 
with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., and gave short shrift to a counterproposal from rival cruise operator Carnival 
Corp. 
In a 196-page prospectus, No. 3 Princess unveiled details of a related joint venture with No. 2 Royal Caribbean 
that has been assailed by Carnival Chief Executive Micky Arison as a "joke venture." Royal Caribbean said it 
was mailing a similar filing to its shareholders yesterday. 
Mr. Arison, of No. 1 Carnival, has said the joint venture is designed to prevent the emergence of an interloper to 
the deal. That is because scrapping the joint venture to combine with another suitor would cost Princess about 
$200 million. In addition, Royal Caribbean and Princess have agreed to a $62.5 million breakup fee should the 
deal fall apart. 
Peter Ratcliffe, Princess's chief executive, countered Carnival's criticism of the joint venture, saying in an 
interview that if the venture doesn't meet certain financial benchmarks, either Royal Caribbean or Princess can 
end it after Jan. 1, 2003, and get back their entire investment. 
Still, the obstacles to another acquirer intervening are clear: If one side in the joint venture undergoes a change in 
control -- such as Princess being acquired by Carnival -- then that party would become a passive investor in the 
joint venture. To end the venture, that party would have to sell its holdings to the other side at a discount, 
accepting preferred stock or subordinated debt in return. For instance, if the joint venture were capitalized at $2 
billion, as the parties have envisioned, dismantling it could cost $200 million, Mr. Ratcliffe said. 
In Miami, Carnival spokesman Tim Gallagher said the cruise concern's executives and advisers were studying the 
Princess materials carefully and had no comment. 
Mr. Ratcliffe said the filing signals that Princess is progressing with its plans for a Feb. 14 shareholder vote on its 
complex merger of equals with Royal Caribbean. "As we stand today, we are moving forward with the Royal 
Caribbean deal," he said. 
The transaction, which involves no swap of shares and would leave each company listed on its respective stock 
exchanges, requires approval by 75% of votes among Princess shareholders. Royal Caribbean shareholders 
must approve the merger by two-thirds of the shares outstanding. Two big investors representing 44.5% of Royal 
Caribbean's shares already have committed to supporting the deal. 
In mid-December, Carnival jumped into the fray with a takeover proposal of its own. Though Princess's board 
immediately rejected the proposal, saying it was too conditional, Princess soon opened the door a crack to a 
revised offer. Princess gave Carnival until Jan. 18 to make a new offer and postponed its shareholder vote on the 
Royal Caribbean deal to Feb. 14 from mid-January to allow time to consider a Carnival offer. 
Though Princess made only scant mention of the Carnival offer in the prospectus, people familiar with the 
situation said the British cruise operator could give serious consideration to a Carnival offer that could be 
completed or a Carnival proposal that would offer Princess some compensation if the deal didn't go through. 
Carnival's current $4.6 billion takeover proposal is conditioned on regulatory clearance.

"We have an irrevocable, firm deal with Royal Caribbean," said Mr. Ratcliffe, who has said he doubts a 
combination with Carnival could pass muster with antitrust regulators. "But, we recognize we are obligated to 
explore every opportunity to get an even better deal." 
In its filing, Princess said it expects to report fourth-quarter earnings of at least 40 cents a share. That is at the top 
of the range of 38 cents to 40 cents it had estimated Oct. 24. For the year-earlier quarter, Princess posted a net 
loss of $3.4 million, or seven cents a share. 
The Princess filing also said Royal Caribbean, which like the rest of the industry has been hit hard by the 
downturn in travel after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, has seen "a steadily improving trend in pricing" over the past 
six weeks. Still, prices, particularly in the first and second quarter of 2002, remain below year-earlier levels, 
according to the filing.

CARNIVAL, the US cruise giant, is preparing to drop some of the conditions of its proposed $3.1bn ((pounds) 
2.15bn) bid for P&O Princess Cruises in an effort to persuade the company to drop its opposition to merger 
talks, according to reports. 
However, leading investors in P&O Princess are concerned Carnival may be manoeuvring to scupper an agreed 
merger between Princess and Royal Caribbean by dividing the partners rather than launching a 
hostile bid. 
The latest developments come at the start of a week in which P&O is due to send details of its proposed merger 
with Royal to shareholders, despite criticisms of the deal and company management from Carnival. 
Soon after P&O and Royal announced plans to merge and create the world's biggest cruising operation, Carnival 
revealed its interest in a deal with P&O to avoid surrendering scale economies to a bigger rival. 
Micky Arison, chief executive, said Carnival had tried to initiate merger talks before the Royal deal was agreed. 
His company said it would pay (pounds) 2.15bn for P&O if six conditions were met. These included ensuring the 
company arranged acquisition funding on decent terms and P&O limited dividend payments until any offer 
became final. 
Carnival wanted the costs of unwinding a joint venture in southern Europe between P&O and Royal to be limited 
to (pounds) 138m. 
Arison made the joint venture and the inclusion in the proposed merger's terms of a (pounds) 43m break fee if 
either combined with another company the subject of angry complaints to the Takeover Panel. 
Carnival now seems to have decided to consider dropping some conditions as part of a more conciliatory 
approach.

LEADING investors in P&O Princess Cruises want assurances that Carnival Cruise Line is committed to tabling 
a #2billion offer for the cruise-line group, write John Waples and Matthew Goodman. 
Carnival has said it intends to make a formal offer, but only after it has seen terms of the $7billion ( #4.9billion) 
merger agreement between P&O and Royal Caribbean Cruises. 
Some investors argue that Micky Arison, Carnival's chief executive, is interested only in scuppering the merger. 
They point out that three times in the past four years Carnival has tabled an offer for a rival company and then 
walked away. 
Peter Ratcliffe, P&O's chief executive, shares a similar concern. He said: "We are looking for assurances that this 
is not a spoiling tactic." 
Arison insists he is committed and told The Sunday Times: "To say that we are disappointed that Lord Sterling, 
(P&O's chairman) or Peter did not call us before signing would be an understatement. We've had conversations 
for many years. P&O is just a very good fit with Carnival." 
This Thursday P&O and Royal Caribbean will release a circular that will detail the precise terms of a $200m 
"poison pill" European joint-venture agreement and a further $62.5m payment if P&O signs a deal with a third 
party.

Carnival Cruise Line is planning to make an appeal to the full Takeover Panel in an attempt to reduce the size of 
a "poison pill" inserted in the $7bn ( #4.8bn) merger agreement between P&O Princess Cruises and Royal 
Caribbean Cruises. 
The Panel's executive is understood already to have ruled that the merger does not fall within Code regulations 
because of its dual listing structure. If Carnival appeals, it will be up to the full Panel to decide whether to back the 
executive. 
Under the proposed P&O/ Royal Caribbean merger, a $62.5m break clause was inserted to deter attempts to 
torpedo the deal. P&O also created a joint venture with Royal Caribbean that would trigger a pay-out of $200m if 
it is broken up. 
Carnival, which last week had its $3.2bn bid for P&O rejected, argues these sums exceed the maximum permitted 
under Panel rules, which limit break fees to 1 per cent of the market capitalisation of the target company - in this 
case $31m. Neither Carnival nor the Panel would comment. 
Carnival, the world's largest cruise line, is also believed to be close to issuing a statement regarding the level of 
synergies it could achieve through a P&O takeover. P&O and Royal Caribbean forecast $100m of annual 
synergies. 
Micky Arison, the Florida billionaire, who together with his family owns 47 per cent of the company founded by 
Ted Arison, his father, said he did not regard the P&O/Royal Caribbean merger as a competitive threat. 
"We view it as a last opportunity to get great brands under the best management in the industry and which we 
have been interested in acquiring over the past two and a half years," he said. 
Mr Arison flew back to the US last night after a week of visits to P&O institutional investors in London and 
Scotland. 
Mr Ratcliffe, chief executive of P&O Princess, which has performed disappointingly since demerging from 
Peninsula &Oriental Steam Navigation last year, has questioned Carnival's commitment by saying he did not want 
to jeopardise the agreement with Royal Caribbean for a proposal "which simply turns out to be a spoiling tactic". 
Carnival is offering 200p cash and 0.14 of a share for every P&O share, valuing P&O at 450p a share. 
P&O's shares closed last night 14 1/2p higher at 399p. 
Mr Ratcliffe argues that Carnival has had ample opportunity to make a serious offer - at a lower price - since the 
demerger but did not do so. 
However, Mr Arison claims that he has assured Lord Sterling, P&O's chairman, that he would not mount a hostile 
offer and that his interest in Princess was well known. 
Next week, P&O is expected to issue its circular to shareholders who have also been given more time to consider 
Carnival's proposals by postponing an extraordinary meeting on the P&O/ Royal Caribbean merger from early 
January to February 14.

Carnival's Quarterly Net Dropped by 40%

Carnival Corp., buffeted by a sharp downturn in leisure travel after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, said fiscal 
fourth-quarter net income plunged 40% to $116.3 million, or 20 cents a share. 
The results came as executives at Miami-based Carnival, the world's largest cruise line, continued a round of 
meetings in the United Kingdom with institutional shareholders of P&O Princess Cruises Ltd. to rally support for 
Carnival's proposal to acquire Princess for about $4.61 billion. 
London-based Princess, the No. 3 cruise line in terms of revenue, already has agreed to combine with No. 2 
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. in a complex merger of equals valued at $2.96 billion. But on Wednesday, Princess 
said it would consider a revised offer from Carnival if Carnival drops various preconditions that Princess says 
make Carnival's current proposal too tentative. Princess has given Carnival until Jan. 18 to make such an offer so 
it could be weighed before Princess shareholders meet Feb. 14 to vote on the Royal Caribbean merger. 
Micky Arison, Carnival's chairman and chief executive, told investors in a conference call yesterday that he is 
confident Carnival could drop various conditions -- except for that of regulatory approval -- if it could meet with 
Princess executives. Mr. Arison said Carnival is in a bind because under U.K. takeover rules, an unconditional 
offer would lapse in 81 days, and Carnival envisions regulatory clearance taking four to six months. 
"Our offer would lapse if we made it unconditional," Mr. Arison said. "They [Princess] know very well that we have 
no choice but to be preconditional. The only precondition that is really meaningful is the regulatory issue." 
Princess Chief Executive Peter Ratcliffe reiterated that his company can't meet with Carnival because its pact 
with Royal Caribbean bars it from soliciting higher bids, although it can weigh unsolicited bids to determine what 
is in the best interest of shareholders. "There is a concept of fair dealing," Mr. Ratcliffe said. "We're trying to be as 
balanced as we can." 
Carnival's earnings beat analysts' lowered expectations of 18 cents a share, according to a survey by Thomson 
Financial/First Call. For the year-ago quarter, Carnival posted net income of $193.8 million, or 33 cents a diluted 
share. Revenue rose 13% to $959.1 million for the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30 from $850.3 million a year 
earlier, largely due to increased capacity. Net yield, or net revenue per passenger cruise day, declined about 8% 
during the quarter due to pricing pressures and lower occupancy. Fourth-quarter net income included an 
impairment charge of $39 million related to writing down the value of two ships, offset in part by a $6 million tax 
benefit. Carnival's year-ago quarterly results included a tax benefit of $27 million. 
Carnival shares rose 27 cents to $27.64 as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
Mr. Arison said vacationers have been booking cruises much closer to the travel date than normal. He said cruise 
bookings have been picking up during the past five weeks after plunging sharply in the first two months after Sept. 
11, but overall advance bookings remain well below last year's levels. The industry will be carefully watching 
buying trends during the so-called wave season that begins in January and runs through early March, typically the 
heaviest booking period of the year.

Companies: Princess Agrees to Consider New Carnival Takeover Bid --- Decision Could Lead to Breakup

P&O Princess Cruises Ltd., apparently softening its stance, said it will consider a revised offer from Carnival 
Corp., likely setting the stage for a bidding war. 
London-based Princess postponed until Feb. 14 a key shareholder meeting that had been set for mid-January to 
review the company's plans to merge with Royal Caribbean. The delay will give Princess shareholders "time to 
consider fully their alternatives in light of Carnival's intervention," Princess said. 
Miami-based Carnival, the world's largest cruise operator, is trying to break up the planned $2.74 billion (3.04 
billion euros) merger between No. 2 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and No. 3 Princess with its own $4.61 billion 
bid for the London-based cruise operator. 
Princess, which contends that the current Carnival offer is too conditional, said Wednesday that if Carnival makes 
an offer before Jan. 18 that Princess believes is "credible and superior," its board will have sufficient time to 
consider and discuss the offer with Carnival. Princess shareholders also would have sufficient time prior to the 
shareholder meeting to consider both the Carnival and the Royal Caribbean transaction, Princess said. 
While opening the door to a Carnival proposal, Princess reiterated its commitment to Royal Caribbean and said it 
believes its pending merger transaction will create significant shareholder value. "We have exactly the same 
attitude today as we did over the weekend," Peter Ratcliffe, chief executive of Princess, said in an interview. 
Princess also suggested that Carnival's conditional proposal was aimed at derailing its merger with Royal 
Caribbean. 
"We are not spoilers," said Micky Arison, Carnival's chairman and CEO, in a prepared statement. "We have 
talked to P&O Princess about a combination of our businesses over a long period of time." 
Meanwhile, Royal Caribbean said it supports Princess's decision to postpone the shareholders' meeting. "I am 
convinced that the merger we have agreed with P&O Princess will provide both sets of shareholders the greatest 
long-term value going forward," said Richard Fain, Royal Caribbean's chairman and CEO. "P&O Princess 
shareholders will recognize that the transaction with Royal Caribbean is superior in all respects to the takeover 
proposal from Carnival," he added in a prepared statement. 
In an interview, Mr. Arison said Princess's intentions are "very, very unclear." Carnival immediately requested a 
meeting with Princess, but was rebuffed. 
"We're guessing it has something to do with their agreement with Royal Caribbean," Mr. Arison said, adding that 
he intends to continue talking to Princess shareholders to make his case that the Carnival bid is superior than the 
Royal Caribbean deal. "Hopefully, the shareholders will convince the board," he said. 
Investors, seeing the door opening to Carnival, drove up Princess's American depositary receipts 4.1%, or 88 
cents, to $22.29 each on the New York Stock Exchange. Carnival gained 15 cents to $27.37, while Royal 
Caribbean fell 3.6%, or 52 cents, to $13.73. 
Mr. Ratcliffe, citing contractual obligations to Royal Caribbean, said he won't meet with Carnival. "We are not 
allowed to do anything that solicits a superior offer," he said in an interview. "I can't meet with them."

Mr. Ratcliffe declined to elaborate on what Princess would consider to be a "credible and superior" offer, saying 
doing so would violate Princess's agreement with Royal Caribbean. He said Princess is intent on recommending 
a "superior" offer to its shareholders. 
In looking at recommending an offer, Mr. Ratcliffe said the Princess board will need to "assess its value to its 
shareholders and its risk of deliverability. We will recommend the one that when you combine the two together is 
the best one." 
Princess has been arguing that the Carnival offer, which is conditioned on regulatory clearance, is less likely to be 
approved than a merger with Royal Caribbean. However, traders who monitor takeover stocks say that both 
proposals have regulatory risks. 
U.K. takeover lawyers say the board of P&O Princess, just like the board of any U.S. company, would need to 
weigh the merits of the Royal Caribbean and Carnival offers and consider which bid is the best in terms of price, 
the prospects for completion, and break-up fees that could arise if the company doesn't proceed with a previously 
agreed deal.

PRINCESS OPEN TO BEST BID

PRINCESS OPEN TO BEST BID

Love Boat owner P&O Princess Cruises is battening down the hatches for a bidding war. 
Though the world's third-largest cruise operator still prefers its friendly, non-cash merger agreement with Royal 
Caribbean, P&O officials said they're willing to give shareholders an extra month to explore a hostile $6 billion 
takeover bid from Carnival Cruises. 
Yesterday's concession means industry leader Carnival will now have until Feb. 14 to either win support for its 
current offer or sweeten the pot. The same goes for No. 2 Royal Caribbean. 
Analysts said the stakes are high not only because the winner will emerge as the world's No. 1 cruise ship 
operator, but because cost- cutting alliances are critical in this era of slumping leisure travel. 
After introducing the new voting timetable, P&O chief Peter Ratcliffe said: "We must be absolutely certain we are 
not jeopardizing our merger with Royal Caribbean, a committed partner, in return for a proposal which simply 
turns out to be a spoiling tactic." 
P&O officials said the main problems with the Carnival offer are too many deal-breaking caveats and greater risk 
of being nixed by regulators. 
There are also important management issues to be resolved. Princess executives would likely remain in charge if 
they take over Royal Caribbean, but could lose their leadership position under Carnival. 
"We are not spoilers," countered Carnival CEO Micky Arison, explaining his company has legitimately pursued a 
combination with P&O Princess for years. 
Though the opposing bids are difficult to compare, analysts said the latest Carnival proposal appears to value 
P&O at least $1 billion higher than the Royal Caribbean deal. 
"We agree with Carnival's view that its offer is more favorable," wrote Legg Mason analyst Sally Wallick in a 
recent report. 
According to Morgan Stanley research, a Princess/Carnival combo would have 47% of the market in North 
America, while a Princess/ Caribbean merger would have 43%. 
Shares in hot commodity P&O rose 88 cents yesterday to $22.21, while Carnival stock gained 15 cents to $27.37, 
and Royal Caribbean shed 52 cents to $13.73.

P&O Princess Cruises Pushes Back Merger Vote to Give Carnival a Chance 
P&O Princess Cruises Pushes Back Merger Vote to Give Carnival a Chance

The battle between the two Miami cruise giants -- Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Carnival Corp. -- to combine 
with London-based P&O Princess Cruises, grew hotter Wednesday. 
P&O Princess set a date of Feb. 14 -- instead of mid-January -- for its shareholders to vote on the proposed 
merger with Royal Caribbean, giving Carnival Corp. a chance to improve its takeover bid and allow shareholders 
time to analyze the two offers. 
P&O Princess Chief Executive Peter Ratcliffe said the British company is still committed to its deal with Royal 
Caribbean. He gave Carnival a Jan. 18 deadline to present a "credible and superior" offer, saying Carnival's 
current bid "didn't deliver value to shareholders and was not as certain of completion as the deal with Royal 
Caribbean." 
Royal Caribbean and Carnival are vying for nothing less than the crowning position in the worldwide cruise 
industry. The combination of Carnival and P&O Princess would create a company with 62 ships and 98,000 
berths, while a Royal Caribbean-P&O Princess combination would have 41 ships and 75,000 berths. Both 
companies have called P&O a strategic fit that would give them complementary brands and boost their positions 
in Europe and North America. 
"It's now up to Carnival to determine what they do next," Ratcliffe said from London. "We are very happy with the 
Royal Caribbean deal. We think it is good for our employees, good for travel agents, good for consumers, and we 
actually think it will be dynamite for our shareholders." 
Less than a month after P&O Princess and Royal Caribbean agreed to merge, Carnival last week presented a bid 
of 200 pence ($2.91) in cash and 0.1361 Carnival shares for each P&O Princess share, a value of $4.6 billion. 
The bid was termed a "conditional offer," subject to financing and regulatory approvals. 
When P&O Princess rejected the bid on Sunday, Carnival Corp. said it would take its case to shareholders. The 
company has been meeting with institutional investors, who own about 80 percent of P&O's shares. 
Analysts say a Carnival takeover brings certain financial benefits. 
"Given the rough cruise industry environment likely over the next few years, we think Carnival's offer provides 
something investors may not yet fully appreciate -- a considerably stronger, more liquid financial base to ride out 
the current industry downturn," wrote Jim Winchester, leisure analyst with Lazard Freres. 
Carnival had wanted P&O to delay its meeting until the regulators in the United States and Europe could rule on 
both deals, a process that could take more than six months. While P&O has said the Carnival takeover would 
face more regulatory risk, Carnival has said that its advisors believe both deals will rise or fall together on antitrust 
issues, depending on whether regulators view the larger vacation market or the smaller cruise segment. 
Carnival Chairman Micky Arison, reached in London Wednesday, called P&O's objections mere 
"smokescreens," and declined to comment on whether he will improve his bid. In its original proposal, Carnival 
said it would boost its offer if P&O could reduce the break-up fees of its Royal Caribbean deal, estimated by 
analysts to exceed $200 million. 
"We clearly have on the table a superior bid, there is no question about that," Arison said. 
Meanwhile, Royal Caribbean confirmed its commitment to the merger and its belief that its deal will provide 
greater long-term value. Royal Caribbean said it also supports P&O Princess' decision to postpone its meeting to 
give shareholders a chance to consider their alternatives.

Page 20 of 78 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Royal Caribbean Chairman Richard Fain, in a statement, said he is convinced that P&O Princess shareholders 
will recognize that Royal Caribbean's deal "is superior in all respects to the takeover proposal from Carnival." 
So far, dealings between Carnival and P&O Princess have without any face-to-face meetings, apparently 
because P&O Princess is constrained by terms of the Royal Caribbean contract. Ratcliffe said P&O Princess is 
"not able to shop," or "do anything that solicits a better deal." 
Extending the meeting beyond Feb. 14 would also apparently violate Royal Caribbean's terms. "In the interests of 
our shareholders we've now pushed this as far as we can," Ratcliffe said. 
"We must be absolutely certain that we are not jeopardizing our merger with Royal Caribbean, a committed 
partner, in return for a proposal which simply turns out to be a spoiling tactic designed to disrupt the creation of 
significant value for P&O shareholders," Ratcliffe said in his announcement setting the deadlines. 
Arison said his company is not a spoiler, and said the decision is now in P&O shareholders' hands. 
"It's not my company, it's not Peter's company. It's the shareholders' company, and they will have to decide what 
is in their best interest," Arison said. "And if they decide the Royal Caribbean deal is in their best interest, we will 
respect that and go home."

P&O Princess Will Consider Revised Carnival Bid

P&O Princess Cruises Ltd., apparently softening its rejection of Carnival Corp.'s proposed acquisition, said it 
would consider a revised offer from Carnival, likely setting the stage for a bidding war between the leading cruise 
operators. 
Princess, which already has an agreement to merge with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., also postponed a key 
shareholder meeting to consider that merger to give its shareholders "time to consider fully their alternatives in 
light of Carnival's intervention." The meeting, which had been scheduled to take place in mid-January, was 
postponed to Feb. 14. 
The move comes as Carnival's chairman and chief executive officer, Micky Arison, continued a round of 
meetings in London with Princess shareholders soliciting support for its acquisition proposal. Miami-based 
Carnival, the world's largest cruise operator, is trying to break up the planned $2.75 billion merger pact between 
No. 2 Royal Caribbean, also in Miami, and No. 3 Princess, based in London, with Carnival's own $4.59 billion 
proposal to acquire Princess. 
Princess has complained that Carnival's initial proposal has too many conditions and faces steep antitrust 
hurdles. But yesterday Princess said that if Carnival makes an offer before Jan. 18 that Princess believes is 
"credible and superior" to the Royal Caribbean merger plan, its board would have time to consider it. Princess 
shareholders would also have sufficient time before the shareholder meeting to weigh both proposals. 
While opening the door to a Carnival offer, Princess reiterated its commitment to Royal Caribbean, saying it 
believes their pending merger would create significant shareholder value. "We have exactly the same attitude 
today as we did over the weekend," Peter Ratcliffe, Princess's chief executive officer, said in an interview. 
Princess also suggested Carnival's conditional proposal was aimed at derailing its merger with Royal Caribbean. 
In an interview, Carnival's Mr. Arison said his company has been earnestly courting Princess for a long time and 
immediately requested a meeting with Princess yesterday afternoon but was rebuffed. He said Princess's 
intentions are "very, very unclear." 
Citing contractual obligations to Royal Caribbean, Princess's Mr. Ratcliffe said in an interview: "We are not 
allowed to do anything that solicits a superior offer. I can't meet with them." 
Investors, seeing the door opening to Carnival, drove Princess shares up 88 cents to $22.21 in New York Stock 
Exchange composite trading at 4 p.m. Carnival shares also closed up 15 cents to $27.37. But Royal Caribbean 
shares closed down 52 cents to $13.73. Analysts said Royal Caribbean has the most to lose if Princess chooses 
Carnival. 
For its part, Royal Caribbean said in a statement yesterday that it supports Princess's decision to postpone the 
shareholders' meeting. Richard Fain, Royal Caribbean's chairman and CEO, said in the statement he is 
convinced that "Princess shareholders will recognize that the transaction with Royal Caribbean is superior in all 
respects." 
Mr. Ratcliffe declined to elaborate on what Princess would consider to be a "credible and superior" offer, saying 
doing so would violate Princess's agreement with Royal Caribbean. Mr. Ratcliffe said that Princess was intent on 
recommending a "superior" offer to its shareholders.

proposals have regulatory risks. 
United Kingdom takeover lawyers say that the Princess board, just like a board in the U.S., would have to weigh 
the merits of Royal Caribbean and Carnival offers and consider which offer is the best in terms of price, the 
prospects for completion, and costs such as break-up fees that could arise if a company scraps an earlier 
commitment.

WRAP: Carnival Fiscal Fourth Quarter Net Income Down 40%

MIAMI -(Dow Jones)- Carnival Corp. (CCL), embroiled in a bidding war to buy rival cruise-line operator P&O 
Princess Cruises Ltd., Thursday said its fiscal fourth-quarter net profit fell 40% after it slashed prices because of 
the global economic slowdown. 
The leading cruise-line operator posted net income of $116.3 million, or 20 cents a diluted share, for the quarter 
ended Nov. 30, compared with $193.8 million, or 33 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 
The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call was for earnings of 18 cents a share. 
Excluding a $39 million impairment charge, the company said it would have posted earnings from operations of 
$159 million. 
Revenue increased 13% to $959.1 million from $850.3 million a year earlier. 
Carnival and other cruise companies have cut prices in an attempt to attract travelers after the Sept. 11 terrorist 
attacks in the U.S. weakened demand. In the weeks after the attacks, Carnival said bookings fell 50%. 
Carnival said 2002 bookings have started to recover from the significant slowdown experienced in the two months 
following Sept. 11. During the last five weeks, booking levels have been 45% above past year's levels, although 
advance bookings for 2002 still remain well behind last year's levels at this time, the company said. Carnival also 
said 2002 prices have risen but are still below last year's levels. 
Meanwhile, Princess, which already has an agreement to merge with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL), has 
apparently softened its rejection of Carnival's proposed acquisition. Princess has said it would consider a revised 
$4.59 billion takeover offer from Carnival, likely setting the stage for a bidding war between the leading cruise 
operators. 
Princess on Wednesday also postponed a key shareholder meeting to consider that merger to give its 
shareholders "time to consider fully their alternatives in light of Carnival's intervention." The meeting, which had 
been scheduled to take place in mid-January, was postponed to Feb. 14. 
The move comes as Carnival's chairman and chief executive officer, Micky Arison, continued a round of 
meetings in London with Princess shareholders soliciting support for its acquisition proposal. Miami-based 
Carnival, the world's largest cruise operator, is trying to break up the planned $2.75 billion merger pact between 
No. 2 Royal Caribbean, also in Miami, and No. 3 Princess, based in London, with Carnival's own proposal to 
acquire Princess. 
Princess has complained that Carnival's initial proposal has too many conditions and faces steep antitrust 
hurdles. But on Wednesday Princess said that if Carnival makes an offer before Jan. 18 that Princess believes is 
"credible and superior" to the Royal Caribbean merger plan, its board would have time to consider it. Princess 
shareholders would also have sufficient time before the shareholder meeting to weigh both proposals. 
While opening the door to a Carnival offer, Princess reiterated its commitment to Royal Caribbean, saying it 
believes their pending merger would create significant shareholder value. 
Princess has also suggested Carnival's conditional proposal was aimed at derailing its merger with Royal 
Caribbean.

IT'S UP FOR SAIL. 
IT'S UP FOR SAIL.

P&O PRINCESS CRUISES yesterday put itself up for auction in the face of a #3 billion takeover approach from 
American rival CARNIVAL. 
The British firm said the move would give shareholders time to study Carnival's call for Princess to scrap its 
planned merger with ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES. 
In a concession to Miami-based Carnival, Princess has scheduled a shareholders' meeting for February 14 - six 
weeks after the firm's board plans to issue a circular urging investors to approve a merger with Royal Caribbean. 
If Carnival made a "credible and superior" offer by January 18, shareholders would have enough time before their 
meeting to decide between the two alternatives, Princess said. 
Carnival's chairman and chief executive Micky Arison had insisted that Princess executives postpone a planned 
January meeting for shareholders to approve the deal with Royal Caribbean. 
Princess chief executive Peter Ratcliffe said: "We must be absolutely certain that we are not jeopardising our 
merger with Royal Caribbean, a committed partner, in return for a proposal which simply turns out to be a spoiling 
tactic. 
"The timetable we have set in place honours our agreement with Royal Caribbean and still gives time for Carnival 
to put forward a credible, deliverable and more valuable transaction." 
Princess at first rejected Carnival's bid - even though it was larger than the $3 billion merger with Royal Caribbean 
- because executives believed regulators would refuse it due to antitrust concerns. 
Carnival is currently the world's largest cruise operator. But Princess's proposed merger with Royal Caribbean 
would create a combined business worth $6 billion and overtake Carnival in size. 
Miami-based Royal Caribbean is the second largest cruise line operator, while Princess, with its HQ in London, is 
at No3. 
The Department of Trade and Industry has yet to decide whether to refer the planned merger to the Competition 
Commission. 
THE tourism slump caused by the September 11 US terrorist attacks has hit sales of electric hotel keys made by 
security firm CHUBB. 
But demand for some of the company's other products and services has risen - and it yesterday announced that 
full-year results should be in line with expectations. Shares jumped 9p to 155 Dp.

P&O Princess Cruises PLC has changed course and put itself up for auction, announcing Wednesday it would 
give shareholders time to study a $4.4 billion takeover bid from Carnival Corp. that it had spurned in favor of a 
merger with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. 
The winners in this three-way tussle will be the world's biggest cruise ship operator.

U.K. Panel Is Unlikely to Act In Cruise Company Merger 
U.K. Panel Is Unlikely to Act In Cruise Company Merger

The U.K. Takeover Panel, a British authority that scrutinizes mergers and acquisitions, is unlikely to intervene in 
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.'s plan to merge with P&O Princess Cruises PLC, according to people familiar with 
the situation. 
The move would mark a setback for Miami-based Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise operator, which is 
trying to break up a planned Royal Caribbean-Princess deal with its own $4.52 billion hostile bid for Princess. 
According to people familiar with the situation, Carnival executives approached the U.K. Takeover Panel, asking it 
to investigate whether Princess breached the panel's rules by unfairly using a poison pill to deflect any 
counterproposal, such as Carnival's hostile bid. 
The $2.85 billion pact between Royal Caribbean and Princess includes a $62.5 million breakup fee and a 
proposed joint venture that may trigger additional fees upon change of control. Carnival asserts that the breakup 
fee exceeds a Takeover Panel rule that limits such fees to 1% of the market capitalization of the target company, 
or about $31 million in the current Royal Caribbean-Princess deal. 
But, according to people close to the situation, the Takeover Panel pointed out to Carnival that the Royal 
Caribbean-Princess deal is structured as a dual-listed entity, with stock market listings in London and New York, 
and that its rules don't govern dual-listed companies. 
Under the terms of the complex transaction, structured to avoid a selloff of shares by investors on both sides who 
may be loath to hold stock in a foreign company, shareholders will retain their respective shares in No. 2 Royal 
Caribbean, based in Miami, and No. 3 Princess, based in London. Royal Caribbean's shares will continue to trade 
on the New York Stock Exchange and Oslo Stock Exchange and Princess's equity will continue to trade on the 
London Stock Exchange. 
A Carnival spokesman declined to comment. A P&O Princess Cruises spokeswoman said that the Royal 
Caribbean transaction isn't subject to the U.K. takeover code. 
Micky Arison, Carnival's chairman and chief executive officer, contends that the joint venture was deliberately 
set up as a poison pill. A Royal Caribbean spokeswoman declined to comment.

RESPONSE TO P&O PRINCESS CRUISES PLC ("P&O PRINCESS") 
Carnival notes the announcement made this morning by P&O Princess that it will 
delay its EGM only until 14 February 2002. 
Carnival has today again requested a meeting with P&O Princess in order to reduce the pre-conditionality of its 
Offer. Carnival has consistently sought to provide as much certainty as possible for P&O Princess Shareholders. 
Accordingly Carnival again requests that P&O Princess provides the information for Carnival to be able to reduce 
the pre-conditionality of its Offer. 
Describing Carnival's Offer as a spoiling tactic is tantamount to accusing Carnival and its advisers of creating a 
false market in P&O Princess Shares, in breach of the Takeover Code and the FSA Code of Market Conduct. 
Carnival utterly repudiates any such suggestion. 
Carnival wishes to correct the misleading announcement made by P&O Princess this morning: 
+ Carnival's Offer is not seeking to force P&O Princess Shareholders 
to vote down the merger proposal. Instead, Carnival is proposing that 
the board of P&O Princess should, in the interests of its 
shareholders, delay the EGM until the regulators have concluded their 
review of both proposals. Carnival wishes to ensure that a level 
playing field is established in order that P&O Princess Shareholders 
can then consider both proposals on the basis of value. 
+ Both proposals are conditional on regulatory approval and neither 
combination can proceed without, inter alia, US antitrust clearance. 
Micky Arison, the Chairman and Chief Executive of Carnival, said: 
"We are not spoilers. We have talked to P&O Princess about a combination of our two businesses over a long 
period of time. The only spoiling tactics are the poison pills entered into by the P&O Princess board, which have 
destroyed shareholder value and which have been entered into in the full knowledge of our longstanding interest 
in P&O Princess."

British Authority Is Unlikely to Act In Cruise Deal

The United Kingdom Takeover Panel, a British authority that scrutinizes mergers and acquisitions, is unlikely to 
intervene in Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.'s plan to merge with P&O Princess Cruises PLC, according to people 
familiar with the situation. 
The move would mark a setback for Miami-based Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise operator, which is 
trying to break up a planned Royal Caribbean-Princess deal with its own $4.52 billion hostile bid for Princess. 
According to people familiar with the situation, Carnival executives approached the U.K. Takeover Panel, asking it 
to investigate whether Princess breached the panel's rules by unfairly using a poison pill to deflect any 
counterproposal, such as Carnival's hostile bid. 
The $2.85 billion pact between Royal Caribbean and Princess includes a $62.5 million breakup fee and a 
proposed joint venture that may trigger additional fees upon change of control. Carnival asserts that the breakup 
fee exceeds a Takeover Panel rule that limits such fees to 1% of the market capitalization of the target company, 
or about $31 million in the current Royal Caribbean-Princess deal. 
But, according to people close to the situation, the Takeover Panel pointed out to Carnival that the Royal 
Caribbean-Princess deal is structured as a dual-listed entity, with stock market listings in London and New York, 
and that its rules don't govern dual-listed companies. 
Under the terms of the complex transaction, structured to avoid a selloff of shares by investors on both sides who 
may be loath to hold stock in a foreign company, shareholders will retain their respective shares in No. 2 Royal 
Caribbean, based in Miami, and No. 3 Princess, based in London. Royal Caribbean's shares will continue to trade 
on the New York Stock Exchange and Oslo Stock Exchange and Princess's equity will continue to trade on the 
London Stock Exchange. 
A Carnival spokesman declined to comment. A P&O Princess Cruises spokeswoman said that the Royal 
Caribbean transaction isn't subject to the U.K. takeover code. 
Micky Arison, Carnival's chairman and chief executive officer, contends that the joint venture was deliberately 
set up as a poison pill. A Royal Caribbean spokeswoman declined to comment. 
In Big Board composite trading at 4 p.m., Carnival shares closed up 39 cents to $27.22. Royal Caribbean closed 
down 17 cents to $14.25 and P&O Princess closed down 90 cents to $21.33.

Carnival, the world's largest cruise operator, may be foiled in its attempts to involve the Takeover Panel in 
blocking the $7bn merger of P&O Princess Cruises and Royal Caribbean Cruises. 
Under the structure proposed by the P&O Princess and Royal Caribbean merger, the merged company would 
have a dual listing in London and New York. But the Takeover Panel does not have jurisdiction over dual-listed 
companies. 
"The establishment of a dual-listed company structure when no persons ... obtains or consolidates control of a 
company is not normally considered to be a transaction to which the Code applies," stated the Panel's 2000-2001 
annual report. 
"The implementation of such a structure may well not be considered to be an offer as defined in the Code," it 
added. 
This is because control does not pass from one company to another and the company - in this case, P&O 
Princess Cruises - would not disappear from the stock exchange. 
In the dual listing structure proposed by P&O/Royal Caribbean, no cash or shares would change hands and both 
companies would retain their separate listings. 
Carnival, which had its $3.2bn offer for P&O rejected, has called in the Takeover Panel claiming that a "poison 
pill" clause, inserted ostensibly to thwart attempts to break up the merger, contravenes the panel's rules. 
P&O created a joint venture with Royal Caribbean which would trigger a $200m payout if it is broken up. A 
$62.5m break clause was also inserted. Carnival argues these sums exceed the maximum permitted under 
Takeover Panel rules. 
However, if the merger does not fall under the Panel's jurisdiction, Carnival would find its arguments carry no 
weight with the body. 
Micky Arison, chief executive of Carnival who holds a 47 per cent stake in the company with his family, was 
yesterday in London speaking to P&O Princess investors. He plans to fly to Scotland on Thursday for more 
institutional meetings. Shares in P&O Princess closed 14p lower at 364p.

P&O Princess to Give Shareholders Time to Consider Carnival's Offer

A Wall Street Journal Online News Roundup 
P&O Princess Cruises PLC has changed course and put itself up for auction, announcing Wednesday that it will 
give shareholders time to study a $4.66 billion takeover bid from Carnival Corp. that it had spurned in favor of a 
merger with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. 
The winners in this three-way tussle between P&O Princess, of London, and the two Miami-based cruise lines 
would form the world's biggest cruise-ship operator. 
In a concession to Carnival (CCL), Princess (POC) has scheduled a shareholders' meeting for Feb. 14, six weeks 
after the company's board plans to issue a circular urging investors to approve the planned merger with Royal 
Caribbean (RCL). 
If Carnival makes a "credible and superior" offer by Jan. 18, then shareholders will have sufficient time before 
their meeting to decide between the offers, Princess said. 
"We must be absolutely certain that we are not jeopardizing our merger with Royal Caribbean, a committed 
partner, in return for a proposal which simply turns out to be a spoiling tactic designed to disrupt the creation of 
significant value for P&O Princess' shareholders," Princess Chief Executive Peter Ratcliffe said. 
"The timetable we have set in place today both honors our agreement with Royal Caribbean and still gives time 
for Carnival to put forward a credible, deliverable and more valuable transaction," Mr. Ratcliffe said. 
Carnival's chairman and chief executive, Micky Arison, had insisted that Princess executives postpone a 
planned January meeting for shareholders to approve the deal with Royal Caribbean. 
Carnival isn't averse to a battle. It went up against Royal Caribbean in 1997 in a failed attempt to prevent Royal's 
agreement to acquire Celebrity Cruises. 
Princess at first rejected Carnival's bid -- even though it is larger than the $3 billion merger with Royal Caribbean 
-- because executives believed that regulators would reject the deal due to antitrust concerns. Carnival is 
currently the world's largest cruise operator. Royal Caribbean is the second-largest cruise-line operator, while 
Princess is No. 3. 
A combined Carnival-Princess would likely draw close antitrust scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic because it 
would create a cruise-ship giant with 62 ships and 87,020 berths, well above a rival Royal Caribbean's 23 cruise 
ships and 47,400 berths. A combination of Royal Caribbean and P&O Princess would have 41 ships and 75,000 
berths, probably not raising as many red flags as a Carnival deal.

U.S. antitrust cops are now on cruise control. 
Carnival Corp.'s hostile bid for P&O Princess Cruises PLC is throwing a spotlight on the regulatory issues facing 
both Carnival and its archrival, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., in their separate attempts to merge with 
London-based P&O Princess. In doing so, investors Monday were trying to determine who could benefit most in a 
cruise-ship market shake-up. 
Carnival's bid could upset Royal Caribbean's move to become the No. 1 player in the industry. If regulators reject 
both deals, Royal Caribbean would remain No. 2. If regulators approve both mergers, P&O Princess shareholders 
could opt for Carnival, leaving Royal Caribbean at sea. 
A Royal Caribbean spokeswoman declined to comment. 
"If one deal has a problem, both will have a problem," said Carnival Chief Executive Micky Arison in an interview 
at the London offices of UBS Warburg Inc., his banker. 
Carnival's GBP 3.1 billion ($4.52 billion) hostile takeover proposal for P&O Princess left investors on both sides of 
the Atlantic grappling with the question of whether Mr. Arison is right. The Carnival proposal, which is conditioned 
on regulatory approval, would create a cruise-ship company with 62 ships and 87,020 berths, well above rival 
Royal Caribbean's 23 cruise ships and 47,400 berths. A combination of Royal Caribbean and P&O Princess 
would have 41 ships and 75,000 berths. Carnival and Royal Caribbean are based in Miami. 
Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, some investors appeared to be buying Mr. Arison's argument, driving 
Royal Caribbean's stock 12% lower to $14.42. P&O Princess stock, meanwhile, jumped 6% to $22.23 on news of 
its newest suitor. Carnival shares fell 1.7% to $26.83. 
Many investors and antitrust lawyers say both combinations will draw intense antitrust review, though the 
Carnival-Princess merger could raise more red flags because Carnival, the world's biggest cruise operator, would 
be combining with P&O Princess, the No. 3 player in the industry. 
"I think both deals will get close antitrust scrutiny but the Carnival-P&O deal is obviously the larger of the two 
deals, so the regulatory risk may be higher," said David Cumming, head of U.K. stocks at Standard Life 
Investments, Edinburgh, Scotland, which manages GBP 80 billion in assets and owns P&O Princess stock. Mr. 
Cumming would like P&O Princess to give its reasons for turning down the Carnival offer on Sunday, which 
valued P&O Princess at a 27% premium to its Friday closing price of 360 pence -- compared with the little or no 
premium deal that P&O Princess and Royal Caribbean unveiled in November. 
Mr. Arison and Peter Ratcliffe, CEO of P&O Princess, believe regulators should look at their proposed deals in 
the context of the broader vacation market, rather than the more narrowly defined cruise-ship market where they 
both command weighty market shares. 
David Balto, a former antitrust enforcer now at White & Case LLP, in Washington, said the cruise lines' argument 
that they are just a sliver of the overall leisure market will be difficult to prove. "When the regulators look at the 
parties' documents and see their pricing, it will be clear that they view each other as the main rival and not other 
travel alternatives," he said. "When Carnival and Royal do a special promotion, it's not because someone in the 
travel industry has lowered the price to travel to Aspen."

Carnival said its proposal is subject to review by the European Union and it expects a Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust 
review to be conducted by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The Royal Caribbean deal must be reviewed by 
regulators in the U.S., Germany and Britain. 
"On a simple market-share basis in North America, Micky Arison is right," said Jamie Rollo, a hotel and leisure 
analyst at Morgan Stanley. "If one deal goes through, the other deal will go through." That is because the market 
shares of both of the combined companies are comparable, with a merged Carnival-P&O Princess commanding 
48% of the market share in North America compared with 42% for a combined Royal Caribbean-Princess. 
Mr. Rollo warned against viewing it so simply. "If the Carnival-Princess merger goes through, Royal Caribbean is 
not a viable No. 2 player," he said. "The last thing a regulator wants is to create a monopoly." That view may carry 
more weight in Europe, where there is a tendency to focus on the effects that a merger will have on other 
competitors in an industry. 
Mr. Rollo said that in Europe, a Carnival-Princess combination would command 30% of the market share -- about 
double the share of a combined Princess-Royal Caribbean. "If Brussels looks at it on a pan-European basis, it 
could be a problem," he said. 
Carnival executives say the European market is so fractured that they expect Europe to be less a regulatory 
problem than the U.S. "We have very small market shares in all countries in Europe with the exception of Italy, 
Spain and France," Mr. Arison said. 
While P&O Princess' Mr. Ratcliffe acknowledged that the U.S. market shares of Carnival and Royal Caribbean 
are similar, he thinks antitrust authorities will focus on Carnival's pre-eminent perch in the U.S. cruise-ship market. 
"Carnival is clearly the dominant force in the industry," he said in a phone interview. "We believe it is easier for the 
No. 3 to merge with the No. 2 than the No. 3 to merge with the No. 1."

LESS than a day after making a #3.2 billion offer for P&O Princess Cruises, Carnival Corporation yesterday took 
its gloves off and attacked the board of P&O. 
Launching its conditional 456p-a-share bid, Carnival poured scorn on the proposed P&O dual listing merger with 
Royal Caribbean Cruises and accused the two companies of using the dual listing structure to avoid the City 
Code on Takeovers and Mergers. 
Howard Frank, Carnival's chief operating officer, said the dual listing was a very bad deal for P&O shareholders, 
but "a home run for Royal Caribbean". 
Mr Frank said that P&O investors received no premium and no cash for their shares under the Royal Caribbean 
proposal and he quoted analysts' forecasts that suggested that P&O shareholders would own just 51 per cent of 
the group while contributing more than 60 per cent of the earnings. 
"If the deal is such a good deal, why have they put in all these poison pills?" he said. The Royal Caribbean deal 
includes a break fee of $62 million ( #42 million), twice the amount that would be permissible under the City Code. 
Carnival, whose chairman is Micky Arison, says it will "go home" if P&O acts to hold a shareholder meeting to 
approve the Royal Caribbean deal. Its bid is also conditional on regulatory consent. P&O said there is no question 
of cancelling the deal with Royal Caribbean because Carnival's bid had too many conditions. 
Peter Ratcliffe, P&O's chief executive, said: "We are concerned to make sure that this bid (by Carnival) is not just 
an attempt to break up the Royal Caribbean proposal." 
Analysts suggest Carnival's bid may make Royal Caribbean sweeten its deal. P&O shares rose 18p to 378p.

LONDON -- In taking a run at Britain's P&O Princess Cruises PLC, Carnival Corp. Chief Executive Micky 
Arison is making a big bet: The regulatory roadblocks facing P&O Princess's current merger deal with Royal 
Caribbean Cruises Ltd. are as big as the ones Carnival would confront if it bought Princess. 
"If one deal has a problem, both will have a problem," said Mr. Arison in an interview at the London offices of UBS 
Warburg Inc., his banker. 
As news spread Monday of Carnival's hostile takeover proposal for P&O Princess that could capsize the 
London-based company's planned deal with Royal Caribbean, investors on both sides of the Atlantic were 
grappling with the question of whether Mr. Arison is right. His takeover proposal, which is conditioned on 
regulatory approval, would create a cruise ship giant with 62 ships and 87,020 berths, well above a rival Royal 
Caribbean's 23 cruise ships and 47,400 berths. A combination of Royal Caribbean and P&O Princess would have 
41 ships and 75,000 berths. 
In trading Monday, investors appeared to be accepting Mr. Arison's argument, driving Royal Caribbean's stock 
11% lower to $14.46 (15.99 euros) in late trading in New York. Investors believe Royal Caribbean is a loser either 
way. If regulators reject both deals, Royal Caribbean will be hurt competitively and, if regulators approve both 
mergers, P&O Princess shareholders will likely opt for Carnival, leaving Royal Caribbean at sea. P&O Princess 
stock, meanwhile, jumped 5% to 378 pence (6.08 euros) on news of its newest suitor. Carnival's shares were 
1.8% lower at $26.80 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Many investors and antitrust lawyers believe that both combinations are fraught with antitrust problems, though 
the Carnival-Princess merger is likely to raise more red flags because Carnival, the world's biggest cruise 
operator, would be combining with the No. 3 player in the industry. 
"I think both deals will get close antitrust scrutiny, but the Carnival-P&O deal is obviously the larger of the two 
deals so the regulatory risk may be higher," said David Cumming, head of U.K. stocks at Edinburgh-based 
Standard Life Investments, which owns P&O Princess stock. Mr. Cumming is waiting to hear from P&O Princess 
about its reasons for turning down the Carnival offer, which valued P&O Princess at a 27% premium to its Friday 
closing price of 360 pence -- far greater than the little or no premium deal that P&O Princess and Royal 
Caribbean unveiled in November. 
Mark Schechter, an antitrust attorney at Howrey Simon Arnold & White LLP in Washington, said regulatory 
questions of both proposed deals are likely to turn largely on whether regulators see the companies as 
behemoths in their own niche or relatively smaller players in the much larger leisure-travel market. "The general 
view in the (U.S.) Department of Justice is that cruises compete with other vacation packages," he said. "The 
question is: `Is there some subset of people who wouldn't chose a different vacation if the cost of cruises went up 
10%?' I think that in the final analysis that would be a hard argument for the government to make." Mr. Schechter 
said that by that analysis the Royal Caribbean deal and the Carnival bid should be viewed equally by regulators 
given their similarity in size and scope. 
Other analysts in Europe aren't so sure. 
"On a simple market-share basis in North America, Micky Arison is right," said Jamie Rollo, a hotel and leisure 
analyst at Morgan Stanley, which isn't involved in the deal. "If one deal goes through, the other deal will go

through." That is because the market shares of both of the combined companies are comparable, with a merged 
Carnival- Princess commanding 47% of the market share in North America compared with 43% for a combined 
Royal Caribbean-Princess, according to Mr. Rollo.

Carnival goes hostile with PO bid. 
Carnival goes hostile with PO bid.

The gloves came off in the battle for control of PO Princess Cruises yesterday when Carnival, the world's largest 
cruise operator, went hostile with a #3.2bn bid to grab its London-based rival. 
Carnival, owner of the QE2 through its control of Cunard Line, said it would go direct to shareholders after PO 
management rejected its overtures in favour of pursuing an earlier proposed tie-up with Royal Caribbean Cruises 
Ltd (RCL). 
Micky Arison, chairman and chief executive of Miami-based Carnival, derided the financial performance of RCL 
describing it as a "weak" partner for PO Princess. 
He stressed the commercial strength of his own group before revealing a long-time interest in the British cruise 
company which included, he said, a proposal to chairman Lord Sterling to buy the entire P O group before it was 
demerged. 
Carnival said it would consider a dual-listing in London and might share some of the cost of a "poison pill" 
break-up clause in the PO-RCL merger proposal if that were needed to complete its own merger with P O 
Princess. 
But, given PO's hostile reception to its offer, "the only thing we can do now is go direct to shareholders," said 
Carnival vice chairman Howard Frank. Carnival has made a cash and stock offer worth 456p per share which 
valued PO Princess at $1bn ( #685m) more than the RCL merger. 
But Peter Ratcliffe, the PO Princess chief executive, said last night that he would not defer an extraordinary 
shareholder meeting scheduled for next month. 
It had been called to approve the $7bn tie-up between the second and third largest players in the cruise market 
which would give them 41 ships and 40,000 staff making them bigger than Carnival. "This bid [by Carnival] gives 
us no reason to do that [defer the EGM]," said Mr Ratcliffe. 
P O expressed concern that a deal between the company and Carnival would offer less long-term value to 
shareholders and could run into regulatory difficulties. 
Investors seemed to agree. While the PO Princess share price rose 4.5%, shareholders were in no hurry to 
accept the rival proposal although they accepted that the RCL offer could still be grounded by the competition 
authorities. 
Carnival has made its offer of 200p in cash plus 0.1361 Carnival shares for each PO share conditional on 
regulatory approval being given first. 
The Miami-based group called on P O shareholders to instruct the board to change its recommendation from RCL 
to Carnival and defer or adjourn the extraordinary meeting. 
If this was not done, Carnival would "have no choice but to go home," said Mr Arison.

Carnival asks for UK ruling on proposed P&O deal. 
Carnival asks for UK ruling on proposed P&O deal.

Carnival, the world's biggest cruise operator, has called in the UK Takeover Panel as part of its campaign to 
break up the proposed $7bn (E7.75bn) merger between P&O Princess Cruises and Royal Caribbean Cruises. 
Carnival, which on Sunday had its $3.2bn bid for P&O rejected, claims P&O contravened Takeover Panel rules by 
unfairly inserting a "poison pill" clause in its offer, against shareholders' best interests. 
Under the proposed P&O/ Royal Caribbean merger, a $62.5m break-clause was inserted to deter any attempts 
from rivals to torpedo the deal. P&O also created a joint venture with Royal Caribbean which would trigger a 
$200m payout if it is broken up. 
Carnival argues these sums exceed the maximum permitted under Takeover Panel rules, the non-statutory code 
that governs bids in the UK. These rules limit break-fees to 1 per cent of the total market capitalisation of the 
target company - in this case $31m. 
Micky Arison, chief executive of Carnival, who together with his family owns 47 per cent of the company, said: 
"We believe the amount involved is off the scale. We won't just write a cheque for $262m." 
Carnival is offering 200p cash and 0.14 of a share for every P&O share. The deal values P&O at 451p a share, a 
25 per cent premium to its closing price on Friday. 
The offer is conditional on regulatory approval, which Carnival estimates could take six to nine months, and on 
next month's P&O shareholder meeting to approve the deal being called off. 
A takeover of P&O by Carnival would create a group with 61 ships, 87,900 berths and $6.3bn revenues. This 
compares with a combined P&O/ Royal Caribbean group with 41 ships, 74,800 berths and $5.6bn revenues. 
Shareholders in P&O are expected to vote on the Royal Caribbean proposal late next month. However, Carnival 
has started a roadshow with P&O's institutional investors, asking them to consider delaying the extraordinary 
general meeting. 
One large shareholder has already called for it to be delayed. "If there really is going to be a firm higher offer 
placed on the table from Carnival, then shareholders should get a clear sight of it," the shareholder said. 
Carnival is also claiming that P&O deliberately inserted the break-fee clause after it made its first approach on 
September 24, because it knew Carnival would bid again. 
However, someone close to the Takeover Panel said that Carnival was facing an "uphill" task. 
"The gap between September 24, when Carnival first approached P&O and November 20, when P&O announced 
its merger with Royal Caribbean is long enough for P&O to argue that they thought Carnival was unlikely to bid," 
he said. 
Moody's Investors Services, the credit rating agency, yesterday said it has placed Carnival's rating under review 
for possible downgrade. Carnival's shares fell 49 cents to $26.81 on Monday while Royal Caribbean fell $1.56 to 
$14.77. P&O's shares rose 18p to 378p.

City - Carnival steams in with #3bn for P&O Princess Offer from world's biggest cruise operator rejected as 
`spoiling tactic'. 
City Correspondent 
CARNIVAL Corporation yesterday launched a hostile #3.1 billion conditional bid for P&O Princess Cruises, 
threatening to blow out of the water the company's nil-premium merger with Royal Caribbean Cruises. 
Micky Arison, chief executive of Carnival, the world's biggest cruise operator, said he was appealing directly to 
shareholders after P&O last week rejected his cash and shares approach, a move he called "baffling". 
P&O shares rose 18 to 378p despite formally rebuffing the offer, which chief executive Peter Ratcliffe called "a 
spoiling tactic", which Carnival would not be able to deliver. Royal's fell 11pc to $14.46. 
Under the terms of the offer, which is conditional on regulatory approval, Carnival is offering 200p cash and 
0.1361 shares, which at $26.67 yesterday, down 2.3pc, valued each P&O share at 450p. 
Howard Frank, Carnival's chief operating officer, said he had rung Mr Ratcliffe on September 24 to propose a 
deal. Instead, Mr Ratcliffe went ahead on November 20 with a merger with Royal Caribbean which Mr Frank 
called "a very bad deal for P&O shareholders". 
He said the Royal deal gave P&0 shareholders 50.7pc of the merged company, even though it was providing 
between 53pc and 65pc of the earnings, depending on which forecasts you used. "It simply makes no sense for 
shareholders," he said. 
He added that two poison pills, a $62.5m break-clause and a $200m joint-venture, also worked against 
shareholders. "If the deal was such a good deal, why did they put all these poison pills in? Why are they trying to 
prevent a third party coming in?" Mr Ratcliffe accepted there were "elements of deal protection" in the agreement 
with Royal Caribbean, but said the Carnival offer was neither "credible nor deliverable". He said the September 
24 conversation with Mr Frank was "just a two-minute call". 
He believed "any combination involving the dominant player is going to need much more regulatory scrutiny", 
while his UK shareholders would not want to hold stock in a US company. 
Adding he had no intention of postponing next month's shareholder meeting to approve the Royal Caribbean deal, 
Mr Ratcliffe said: "I want to be absolutely sure that the motivation of Carnival is not to break up the deal that we 
have for our shareholders." 
Mr Arison said he was serious. Buying P&O would create a 61-strong fleet, with revenues of $6.9 billion and 
underlying earnings of $1.9 billion a year. 
He said he had tried to buy P&O Princess before the demerger, even offering to acquire the entire P&O group just 
to get his hands on it. "We went to Pall Mall and saw Lord Sterling [chairman], and had a wonderful lunch and 
wine. We were royally treated but Lord Sterling would not sell."

Page 46 of 78 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
He believed both transactions would face the same regulatory problems. "If they look simply at the cruise market, 
it's three going down to two. But we think they should look at the whole vacation market where cruising has only a 
small share." He added that he thought the regulators had "made a mistake" when blocking Airtours/First Choice. 
Tim Rees, a fund manager at Clerical & Medical, which holds 1.1pc of P&O shares, said he was still backing the 
Royal deal because Carnival "brings the regulatory issues to the fore".

Carnival Makes Bid For P&O Princess To Stop Rival's Deal --- Cruise Company Rejects Offer Valued at About 5.15 Billion Euros 
Carnival Makes Bid For P&O Princess To Stop Rival's Deal --- Cruise Company Rejects Offer Valued at 
About 5.15 Billion Euros

LONDON -- Carnival Corp., seeking to break up a planned merger between two of the world's biggest cruise 
companies, on Sunday publicly launched an unsolicited cash-and-stock bid for British P&O Princess Cruises 
PLC that is valued at about GBP 3.2 billion (5.15 billion euros). 
Moving to respond even before Carnival could unveil its offer, P&O Princess said its board, after considering the 
Carnival proposal over the weekend, had rejected it. P&O Princess said its current merger plans with Royal 
Caribbean Cruise Lines Ltd. remain the most attractive alternative for its shareholders. 
As part of its proposal, Carnival is offering 200 pence in cash and 0.1361 Carnival share for each P&O Princess 
share, valuing the company at about GBP 3.2 billion, based on Carnival's share price in Friday 4 p.m. composite 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
"We believe that our proposal is in the best interest of P&O Princess Cruises' shareholders," said Carnival 
Chairman and Chief Executive Micky Arison. Mr. Arison said the Royal Caribbean deal would give P&O Princess 
shareholders an investment in a less attractive entity with greater financial risk and on terms that give Royal 
Caribbean shareholders a greater proportion of the ownership of the combined concern. 
In a sign that the battle between the Carnival and P&O Princess could become one of the more contentious 
takeover bids of the year, P&O Princess in its statement said Carnival's offer was actually valued at GBP 3.1 
billion, based on Carnival's closing stock price on Dec. 12. 
One of the sticking points in Carnival's offer is that it is subject to regulatory and antitrust approval, which could 
prove nettlesome because both companies have significant routes in the Caribbean and other parts of the world. 
The offer may also draw scrutiny from the U.K. takeover panel since Carnival's proposal is conditional. 
Carnival's counterbid comes nearly a month after P&O Princess agreed to merge with Miami-based Royal 
Caribbean, creating a new company that would leapfrog Carnival as the world's biggest cruise operator. 
Cruise companies, along with most of the travel industry, have been hard hit in the weeks following Sept. 11, as 
reservations have dried up -- forcing some companies into bankruptcy and others into the hands of their rivals. 
Carnival's move comes after the cruise operator, also based in Miami, last week sent a "bear hug" letter to 
London-based P&O Princess, saying it was interested in pursuing a merger and giving terms. Carnival had hoped 
to engage P&O Princess in friendly negotiations but P&O Princess's statement on Sunday suggests Carnival 
would have to launch a hostile offer to win control of the company. 
Carnival said it has made several approaches to P&O Princess in the past two years, most recently on Sept. 24, 
less than eight weeks before the proposed merger with Royal Caribbean was announced. 
"We were quite surprised by the announcement and its terms, particularly the break fee and Southern European 
Joint Venture, given that P&O Princess Cruises's senior management ignored our approach, although they were 
acutely aware of our ongoing keen interest in entering into discussions," said Mr. Arison. 
In rejecting the bid, P&O Princess said its board had concluded the Carnival proposal isn't as favorable financially 
to P&O Princess shareholders and would face greater execution risk than the transaction with Royal Caribbean. 
"Our response to Carnival is based on two clear criteria: value for our shareholders and deliverability," said Peter 
Ratcliffe, chief executive of P&O Princess. "The proposal falls short on both counts."

In its statement, P&O Princess said the cash part of Carnival's offer would be financed through existing resources 
and new facilities. 
Soon after Royal Caribbean and P&O Princess announced their intention to merge, Wall Street surmised Carnival 
would jump into the fray with its own bid for P&O Princess. Carnival is known for being acquisitive; the industry 
leader had approached P&O Princess's parent in 1999 about a possible combination but was rebuffed. 
Carnival isn't averse to entering a battle. The company went up against Royal Caribbean in 1997, when the latter 
agreed to acquire Celebrity Cruises. Carnival tried to intervene but later backed off. 
Financially, Carnival is in strong shape. The company has a stellar balance sheet, with $3.3 billion (3.65 billion 
euros) in cash and credit lines. For its fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31, Carnival reported net income of $494.9 
million, or 84 U.S. cents a share, on revenue of $1.49 billion. That compared with earnings of $396.2 million, or 67 
cents a share, on revenue of $1.23 billion a year earlier. 
Carnival also has a portfolio of six cruise brands, offering prices from budget to ultra-luxury, and operates in 
regions from the Caribbean to Alaska to the Mediterranean. The P&O Princess brand is also well known among 
consumers and might easily fit into the Carnival family. 
Still, a Carnival-P&O Princess deal would likely spark the scrutiny of regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Carnival holds a 36% share of the North American cruise market, while P&O Princess holds 11%. Like the Royal 
Caribbean-P&O Princess deal, the question of antitrust clearance is likely to turn on whether regulators view the 
companies as giants in the cruise industry or small players in the larger tourism market. Royal Caribbean and 
P&O Princess sought to argue that the combined company would compete against land-based resorts and hotels 
-- or the much bigger travel industry. 
While Royal Caribbean said its deal with P&O Princess fell short of the sales threshold for European Union 
antitrust scrutiny, it isn't clear whether that would be the case with a Carnival-P&O Princess combination.

LONDON, Dec. 16 /PRNewswire/ -- Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) today announced the terms of a 
pre-conditional offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of P&O Princess Cruises PLC (NYSE: POC). 
Under the terms of the pre-conditional offer, P&O Princess Cruises' shareholders would receive 200 pence in 
cash and 0.1361 Carnival shares for each P&O Princess Cruises share. Based on the New York Stock 
Exchange closing price of a Carnival share of $27.30 on Dec. 14, 2001, the last business day prior to the date of 
the announcement of the offer, the value of the offer is approximately 456 pence per share, a premium of 44 
percent to the closing middle market price of 317 pence per P&O Princess Cruises share on November 19, 
2001, the last business day prior to the announcement of P&O Princess Cruises' proposed transaction with 
Royal Caribbean Ltd. It represents a premium of 27 percent to the closing middle market price of 360 pence per 
P&O Princess Cruises share on Dec. 14, 2001, the last business day prior to Carnival's offer announcement. 
"We believe that our proposal is in the best interest of P&O Princess Cruises' shareholders," said Carnival 
Corporation Chairman and CEO, Micky Arison. "The proposed combination of Carnival Corporation and P&O 
Princess Cruises creates a global vacation and leisure company with an enhanced offering of complementary 
brands and greater geographic reach. We are offering P&O Princess Cruises' shareholders the opportunity to 
share in the future successes that we believe the combined management teams will bring to this enlarged group," 
he explained. 
Arison went on to say that Carnival believed that the Royal Caribbean proposal would leave P&O Princess 
Cruises' shareholders with an investment in a less attractive entity with greater financial risk and on terms which 
give Royal Caribbean shareholders a greater proportion of the ownership of the combined group than is merited 
by its profit contribution to the combined group's net income. 
Carnival has made several approaches to P&O Princess Cruises in the past two years, most recently on 
September 24, 2001, less than 9 weeks before the proposed merger with Royal Caribbean was announced. "We 
were quite surprised by the announcement and its terms, particularly the break fee and Southern European Joint 
Venture, given that P&O Princess Cruises senior management ignored our approach although they were acutely 
aware of our ongoing keen interest in entering into discussions," Arison said. 
If successful, the proposed transaction is expected to be accretive to 
Carnival Corporation's earnings per share in the first full financial year 
after the combination.* 
* This statement should not be interpreted to mean that the earnings per 
Carnival Share for the current or future financial years will 
necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings per 
Carnival Share. 
On Thursday, Dec. 13, 2001 Carnival Corporation submitted a proposal letter outlining a combination with P&O 
Princess Cruises to the P&O Princess Cruises' board. A copy of the proposal letter follows this release. Late 
today, P&O Princess Cruises advised Carnival that it was rejecting the proposal. Carnival has therefore decided 
to communicate the offer directly to P&O Princess Cruises shareholders. The summary of the pre-conditional 
announcement follows this release; a full copy of the pre-conditional announcement and slides for the analyst 
presentation is posted on Carnival's website under www.carnivalcorp.com. 
The pre-conditional offer is subject to the pre-conditions attached and to certain customary closing conditions and 
other regulations.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
Certain statements in this announcement constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the 
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Carnival has tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements 
by using words such as "anticipate," "assume," "believe," "expect," "intend," "plan" and words and terms of similar 
substance in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. These forward-looking 
statements, including those which may impact the forecasting of Carnival's net revenue yields, booking levels, 
price, occupancy or business prospects, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which 
may cause Carnival's actual results, performances or achievements to be materially different from any future 
results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors 
include, among others, the following: general economic and business conditions which may impact levels of 
disposable income of consumers and the net revenue yields for Carnival's cruise products; consumer demand for 
cruises and other vacation options; other vacation industry competition; effects on consumer demand of armed 
conflicts, political instability, terrorism, the availability of air service and adverse media publicity; increases in 
cruise industry and vacation industry capacity; continued availability of attractive port destinations; changes in tax 
laws and regulations; Carnival's ability to implement its shipbuilding program and to continue to expand its 
business outside the North American market; Carnival's ability to attract and retain shipboard crew; changes in 
foreign currency rates, security expenses, food, fuel, insurance and commodity prices and interest rates; delivery 
of new ships on schedule and at the contracted prices; weather patterns; unscheduled ship repairs and 
dry-docking; incidents involving cruise ships; impact of pending or threatened litigation; and changes in laws and 
regulations applicable to Carnival. 
Carnival cautions the reader that these risks may not be exhaustive. Carnival operates in a continually changing 
business environment, and new risks emerge from time to time. Carnival cannot predict such risks nor can it 
assess the impact, if any, of such risks on its business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks may 
cause actual results to differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking 
statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. Carnival undertakes no obligation to 
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or 
otherwise.

Proposal to the Board of P&O Princess 
Set out below is the full text of the detailed proposal sent by Carnival to 
the board of P&O Princess and their advisors on 13 December 2001: 
" 
Carnival Corporation 
Carnival Place 
3655 N.W. 87 Avenue 
Miami, Florida 33178-2428 
United States 
The Board of Directors 
P&O 
Princess Cruises plc 
77 New Oxford Street 
London WC1A 1PP 
United Kingdom 
13 December 2001 
For the attention of Lord Sterling of Plaistow and Mr Peter Ratcliffe 
Dear Sirs 
Introduction 
I am writing to set out a proposal by Carnival Corporation ("Carnival") to make an offer for P&O Princess Cruises 
plc ("P&O Princess") (the "Offer"). We strongly believe that our proposal has a clear strategic rationale and is a 
compelling investment case for the shareholders of both companies, and is therefore worthy of detailed and 
serious consideration by you and your advisors. 
Our Offer would give P&O Princess shareholders 200p in cash and 0.1361 Carnival Shares for each P&O 
Princess Ordinary Share. Based on yesterday's closing price of $26.55 per Carnival Share, (1837p, converted at 
an exchange rate of $1:0.692 pounds), P&O Princess shareholders will receive consideration with an aggregate 
value of 450p for each P&O Princess Ordinary Share. 
We believe that our proposal delivers substantially more value to P&O Princess shareholders than the proposed 
dual listed company (the "DLC") transaction with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (the "Royal Caribbean Proposal"). 
Unlike the Royal Caribbean Proposal, which does not offer a premium to P&O Princess shareholders, our Offer 
provides P&O Princess shareholders with a significant premium for their shares. Furthermore, our Offer includes 
a substantial cash element. 
As you know, we have had discussions over recent years with P&O Princess and its former parent regarding a 
possible combination of Carnival and P&O Princess. Most recently, on 24 September 2001, Howard Frank, Vice 
Chairman and COO of Carnival, called Peter Ratcliffe to say that Carnival wished to pursue a combination of the 
two groups. We have not received a response to this approach.

Page 52 of 78 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Against this background, we were surprised to see the announcement of the Royal Caribbean Proposal, as 
Carnival has the interest and capability to offer an attractive proposal to your shareholders and had clearly 
expressed a strong interest in a combination with P&O Princess. We have decided that, in the circumstances, we 
should write this letter to the board of P&O Princess to seek to ensure that our proposal receives the attention we 
believe it deserves. 
We ask that, prior to 6pm (UK time) on Sunday, 16 December 2001, you respond formally to our request for a 
recommendation of our Offer. To demonstrate our commitment to progress the Offer as rapidly as possible, my 
senior colleagues and I are keen to meet with you at your earliest convenience. I shall be contacting Lord Sterling 
and Peter Ratcliffe by telephone, in order to discuss our proposal with them directly. 
The Royal Caribbean Proposal 
The proposed transaction between P&O Princess and Royal Caribbean is, in our 
view, disadvantageous to P&O Princess' shareholders, as the terms of the 
transaction fail to recognize a number of substantive issues: 
* P&O Princess shareholders do not receive any premium or cash 
consideration 
* P&O Princess shareholders will own 50.7% of the combined entity but, 
based on analyst forecasts, P&O Princess is expected to contribute 
significantly more than this to the combined entity's net income before 
synergies. P&O Princess' contribution, based on publicly available 
selected analysts' forecasts where 2003 estimates are available, is as 
follows: 
P&O Princess earnings 
contribution pre synergies 
Date 2002 2003 
SSSB 29-Nov-01 64.4% 57.7% 
Bear Stearns 9-Nov-01, 21-Nov-01 53.0% 57.7% 
MSDW 21-Nov-01 59.5% 45.7% 
UBSW 5-Dec-01 65.5% 59.6% 
P&O Princess' proposed share 
of combined earnings 50.7% 50.7% 
Accordingly, a disproportionate share of the synergy benefits is expected to 
accrue to Royal Caribbean's shareholders, in the form of earnings enhancement, 
rather than to P&O Princess' shareholders 
* Royal Caribbean is highly geared and currently has a sub-investment 
grade rating. The terrorist events of September 11 have had a 
significant negative impact on the cruise industry and such an event 
could happen again. Given these uncertain times, as well as the 
significant capital commitments that Royal Caribbean and P&O Princess 
have made, prudent management practice makes it incumbent that a strong 
and flexible balance sheet be maintained. P&O Princess' credit rating 
has already been downgraded in anticipation of the Royal Caribbean 
Proposal. Despite this, the Royal Caribbean Proposal does not 
compensate P&O Princess' shareholders for the extra financial risk they 
would bear if the transaction were to be consummated 
* the most senior management position in the combined group has been 
awarded to the Royal Caribbean Chairman and CEO. P&O Princess' return 
on capital has been superior to that of Royal Caribbean, which has 
lagged both Carnival and P&O Princess. P&O Princess and its 
shareholders should consider whether the decision to appoint 
Royal Caribbean's Chairman and CEO to the same position in the combined 
group is in the company's best interests 
* the DLC structure in the Royal Caribbean Proposal may constrain P&O 
Princess' ability to raise capital, make acquisitions and engage in 
other corporate activity. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that 
P&O Princess will not trade at a discount to Royal Caribbean after the 
DLC structure has been implemented.

Page 53 of 78 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
In summary, we believe the Royal Caribbean Proposal will leave P&O Princess shareholders with an investment 
in a less attractive entity with greater financial risk and on terms which give Royal Caribbean a greater proportion 
of the ownership of the combined group than is merited by its contribution to the combined group's net income. 
The "poison pills" 
We are particularly concerned that certain details of the Royal Caribbean Proposal, namely the Southern 
European joint venture (the "Joint Venture") and the $62.5 million break fee (the "Break Fee"), both entered into 
without shareholder approval, appear to have been constructed as "poison pills", designed to deter or thwart any 
counterproposal to P&O Princess shareholders. 
Carnival has reviewed the publicly available information on the Joint 
Venture and Break Fee and makes the following observations: 
* no substantive commercial reason has been advanced for the immediate 
need to conclude the Joint Venture agreement, with its associated costs 
on a change of control, particularly when the Joint Venture itself is 
not intended to commence cruise operations until 2003. Indeed, we 
believe the Joint Venture company's aims could be achieved solely 
through the DLC. The main, if not sole, effect of the Joint Venture 
is, in our opinion, to make P&O Princess less attractive and less 
vulnerable to a third party offeror, as it seriously disadvantages 
P&O Princess if there is a change of control of P&O Princess. This is 
clearly contrary to the interests of P&O Princess shareholders 
* the Break Fee is significantly in excess of the UK market norm. On 19 
November 2001, P&O Princess' market capitalization was approximately 
$3.1 billion and, therefore, the size of the Break Fee greatly exceeds 
the maximum that would have been permitted under the City Code on 
Takeovers and Mergers (the "Takeover Code", which is recognized in the 
UK as best practice) of 1% or approximately $31 million. 
Why Carnival is the best partner for P&O Princess 
The board of Carnival firmly believes that Carnival is the best partner for 
P&O Princess. Set out below are a number of key historic measures that 
compare the financial and operating performance of Royal Caribbean and 
Carnival. These data reinforce our belief that Carnival's management team has 
a stronger track record, clearly focused on enhancing shareholder value, which 
will be critical in rapidly delivering the synergies a combination should 
bring. 
* Carnival's shareholder returns have consistently outperformed those of 
Royal Caribbean

(2) Prior to the announcement of the Royal Caribbean Proposal 
Based on Carnival's performance as outlined above, we believe that P&O Princess shareholders would be better 
served through a combination with Carnival than with Royal Caribbean, particularly where such a combination 
includes a premium valuation of P&O Princess' business. 
Benefits of the proposed combination of Carnival and P&O Princess 
We believe that a combination of Carnival and P&O Princess has a strong 
strategic rationale and represents a compelling investment case that, 
particularly in the current economic climate, would be well received by the 
shareholders of both our companies. 
We believe that this proposed combination: 
* generates significant synergies to the benefit of both shareholders and 
customers. These savings are expected to come from leveraging the best 
practice of the two best management teams in the industry to achieve 
efficiencies from, inter alia, purchasing, marketing and information 
systems, and also from rationalizing support operations in locations 
served by both companies. We hope to identify substantial additional 
benefits when we are provided with access to P&O Princess' detailed 
financial and operational data 
* benefits from the financial flexibility of the combined group's strong 
balance sheet and cash flow. We believe that the terms of the Offer 
would ensure that the proposed combination of Carnival and P&O Princess 
would retain a strong financial position with an investment grade 
rating 
* creates a broader and more complementary portfolio of brands operating 
in the US and Europe, thereby enhancing the combined group's ability to 
attract more customers away from land-based vacations to cruise 
vacations, and creates a wider range of vacation choices for our 
combined customer base 
Carnival's proposal 
Offer structure 
Carnival is prepared to make the Offer on the following basis: 
for each P&O Princess Share 200p in cash and 0.1361 Carnival Shares 
On the basis of a Carnival Share price of $26.55 (being the price at the 
close of business yesterday), and an exchange rate of $1:0.692 pounds, the 
Offer values each P&O Princess Ordinary Share at 450p (equivalent to $26.01 
per ADR) (consisting of 200p in cash and 250p in Carnival Shares) and values 
the entire existing ordinary share capital of P&O Princess at approximately 
3.1 billion pounds. This represents:

Page 55 of 78 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
* a premium of 42.0% to the closing middle market price of 317p per 
P&O Princess Ordinary Share on 19 November 2001, the last business day 
prior to the announcement of the Royal Caribbean Proposal 
* a premium of 22.6% to the closing middle market price of 367p per 
P&O Princess Ordinary Share on 12 December 2001, the last business day 
prior to this letter 
* a premium of 13.4% to the highest closing middle market price of 397p 
per P&O Princess Ordinary Share at which P&O Princess has traded since 
its demerger. 
It is Carnival's intention that the cash element of the Offer be provided under a mix and match structure such that 
shareholders have an element of choice to take shares or cash. 
Carnival intends to seek a listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange to facilitate and encourage the 
continuing participation by P&O Princess' shareholders in the combined group. 
It is intended that the cash consideration for the Offer amounting to $2.0 billion be financed through existing 
resources of Carnival and new facilities. Currently Carnival has cash and undrawn facilities totalling approximately 
$2.4 billion. 
Potential for Increased Consideration 
If P&O Princess is able to reduce or eliminate the costs to Carnival of the poison pills, Carnival is prepared to 
increase the value of the Offer. 
Alternative Transaction Structures 
Carnival is prepared to discuss alternative transaction structures with P&O Princess including, inter alia, a dual 
listed company. In such a scenario, Carnival envisages that the economic interests of each party under such a 
structure would reflect the valuation of P&O Princess as set out in the proposal above. Such a structure would 
enable P&O Princess to retain all of perceived benefits of the proposed DLC structure with Royal Caribbean 
whilst allowing P&O Princess shareholders to benefit from our premium economic proposal and stronger financial 
position. 
Outstanding Issues 
Before proceeding with the Offer, we would require the following issues to 
be resolved: 
(i) Carnival having received all information which was provided by P&O 
Princess to Royal Caribbean in connection with the Royal Caribbean 
Proposal, as would be supplied if Rule 20.2 of the Takeover Code had 
applied 
(ii) the board of P&O Princess either not convening the EGM for the 
approval of the Royal Caribbean Proposal, or, if it is under an 
obligation to convene such meeting, recommending that shareholders 
vote against the Royal Caribbean Proposal 
(iii) appropriate regulatory clearances being obtained in a form 
satisfactory to Carnival (see below) 
(iv) Carnival being satisfied that the cost to P&O Princess of 
terminating the Joint Venture in the event of the Offer becoming 
wholly unconditional will not be in excess of $200 million 
(v) The board of P&O Princess undertaking that in the period from the 
date of this letter until the Offer becomes wholly unconditional, 
P&O Princess will not declare or pay dividends in excess of 3 US 
cents per P&O Princess Ordinary Share each quarter 
(vi) Carnival having arranged funding for the Offer on terms satisfactory 
to it. 
We would envisage that items (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) would be resolved prior to announcing the Offer. Carnival is 
willing to secure the relevant funding prior to announcement if it is necessary to secure the Board's 
recommendation. On this basis, the making of the Offer would be subject only to regulatory approval.

Regulatory Approvals 
Our proposal is subject to clearance from the relevant antitrust 
authorities, in particular those in the EU and US. We have examined the 
requirements for approval and have received advice from our external antitrust 
advisors that the likelihood of Carnival receiving a favorable outcome is no 
less than that of the Royal Caribbean Proposal. 
* We believe, as Royal Caribbean and P&O Princess have stated, that we 
compete in a broad vacation market rather than simply a cruise market. 
Carnival and Royal Caribbean are similarly situated in that market. 
Both companies undertake substantial efforts to attract consumers from 
other vacation options. That analysis should result in a view that 
there are no significant antitrust issues for either transaction 
* in Europe, our proposal would be subject to the centralized EU merger 
control process, rather than the independent review of certain EU 
member states as we understand is the case for the Royal Caribbean 
Proposal. We believe that Carnival's antitrust process would be 
completed within a similar timeframe to that of the Royal Caribbean 
Proposal, and would not face greater regulatory hurdles than the Royal 
Caribbean Proposal 
* in the US, our proposal would be subject to the Hart-Scott-Rodino 
process, which will not differ significantly in timing or substantive 
issues from the FTC review of the Royal Caribbean Proposal. In fact, 
Royal Caribbean and Carnival's comparable brands are very similar in 
size and scope, as shown below: 
Carnival brands Berths Royal Caribbean brands Berths 
Carnival Cruise Lines 33,246 Royal Caribbean Intl 33,046 
HAL 13,348 Celebrity Cruises 14,332 
------ ------ 
46,594 47,378 
As a result, whilst we believe that there should be no significant antitrust issues in the US, if there were to be such 
issues, they would be substantially the same for both the Royal Caribbean and Carnival proposals. 
Board, Management and Employees 
The combination of Carnival and P&O Princess will offer P&O Princess employees exciting career prospects for 
the future. P&O Princess' management and employees will benefit under our proposal from a larger operating 
platform and a business of greater international size and scope. 
Carnival operates its various cruise businesses on a decentralized basis, whilst optimizing the cost base through 
shared services. We envisage extending this approach to the businesses of P&O Princess. 
We are prepared to offer members of P&O Princess' senior executive management important and influential 
positions in the enlarged group, including as appropriate, at Carnival board level. 
Other Matters 
Neither our interest in P&O Princess nor the contents of this letter may be disclosed by P&O Princess to any 
person, other than your professional advisors, without our prior written consent. Carnival reserves the right to 
terminate discussions immediately and without any obligation on its part whatsoever. 
This letter is intended only to convey Carnival's interest in a possible transaction with P&O Princess. For the 
avoidance of doubt, this letter should not be construed in any regard as constituting an offer, evincing an intention 
to make an offer or otherwise giving rise to legal relations and in particular, does not constitute a firm intention to 
make an offer for the purposes of Rule 2.2 of the Takeover Code. 
We should like to reiterate our strong interest in acquiring P&O Princess 
and our ability to move speedily to an announcement. We believe that our 
proposal is significantly more attractive to P&O Princess and its shareholders 
than the Royal Caribbean Proposal. We look forward to your response to this

letter which in any event should be received prior to 6pm (UK time) on Sunday, 
16 December 2001. 
Yours sincerely 
M. Arison 
Chairman and CEO" 
Carnival Corporation ("Carnival") 
Pre-Conditional Offer to be Made by Merrill Lynch and UBS Warburg 
For P&O 
Princess Cruises Plc ("P&O Princess") 
Summary 
* The board of Carnival today announces the terms of a pre-conditional 
offer to acquire the whole of the issued and to be issued share capital 
of P&O Princess. 
* The Offer comprises 200 pence in cash and 0.1361 Carnival Shares for 
each P&O Princess Share with a Mix and Match Election, as described 
below. 
* Based on the New York Stock Exchange closing price of a Carnival Share 
of $27.30 on 14 December 2001, the last business day prior to the date 
of this Announcement, and an exchange rate of $1:0.689 pounds, the 
Offer values each P&O Princess Share at 456 pence and the entire 
existing share capital of P&O Princess at approximately 
3.2 billion pounds. 
* The Offer represents: 
-- a premium of 44 per cent. to the closing middle market price of 
317 pence per P&O Princess Share on 19 November 2001, the last 
business day prior to the announcement of the Royal Caribbean 
Proposal; and 
-- a premium of 27 per cent. to the closing middle 
market price of 360 pence per P&O Princess Share on 
14 December 2001, the last business day prior to the date of this 
Announcement. 
* If, before the first closing date of the Offer, the board of 
P&O Princess is able to achieve a reduction in the cost of the Break 
Fee and of exiting the Joint Venture, then Carnival will be prepared to 
share the savings, net of costs, with P&O Princess Shareholders. 
* The combination of Carnival and P&O Princess will create a global 
vacation and leisure company with a strong and flexible financial 
position. Carnival believes that the Offer is significantly more 
attractive to P&O Princess Shareholders than the Royal Caribbean 
Proposal. 
* Carnival has the strongest operating and financial record among the 
listed cruise companies and believes that the adoption of best practice 
from the two management teams will generate significant benefits for 
customers and shareholders. 
* The acquisition of P&O Princess is expected to be earnings enhancing 
for Carnival in the first full financial year of ownership.(*) 
(*) This statement should not be interpreted to mean that the earnings 
per Carnival Share for the current or future financial years will 
necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings per 
Carnival Share. 
* Carnival has had a number of discussions over recent years with 
P&O Princess and its former parent, P&O, regarding a possible 
combination of Carnival and P&O Princess. On 24 September 2001, only 
eight weeks prior to the announcement of the Royal Caribbean Proposal, 
Carnival contacted P&O Princess proposing a combination, but has 
received no response to this approach. 
* Having considered its options following the announcement of the Royal 
Caribbean Proposal on 20 November 2001, Carnival submitted a detailed 
proposal regarding an offer for P&O Princess to the board of P&O 
Princess on Thursday, 13 December 2001. The proposal included a 
request that a recommendation be forthcoming from the board of

Page 58 of 78 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
P&O Princess for the Offer. A copy of this proposal is set out as 
Appendix V. 
* As of the publication of this Announcement, neither P&O Princess nor 
its advisors have entered into any discussion with Carnival or its 
advisors regarding the proposal. The board of P&O Princess has, 
however, today written to Carnival rejecting the Offer, stating a 
belief that the Offer is not as favourable financially to the 
P&O Princess Shareholders and would face greater execution risk than 
the Royal Caribbean Proposal. 
* The posting of the Offer Document is pre-conditional, inter alia, on 
the board of P&O Princess either not convening the EGM for the approval 
of the Royal Caribbean Proposal, or, if it is under an obligation to 
convene such meeting, recommending that shareholders vote against the 
Royal Caribbean Proposal. 
* The posting of the Offer Document is also pre-conditional on certain 
regulatory clearances being obtained. Given the probable regulatory 
timetable, the posting of the Offer Document is also pre-conditional on 
financing to avoid incurring unnecessary expense. Carnival currently 
has cash and existing facilities of approximately $2.4 billion. 
* Carnival will not proceed with the Offer if the P&O Princess 
Shareholders approve the Royal Caribbean Proposal. 
Reasons for the Offer 
Benefits of the proposed combination of Carnival and P&O Princess 
* A combination of Carnival and P&O Princess creates a global vacation 
and leisure company with a broader, more diverse and more complementary 
portfolio of brands, creating a wider range of vacation choices for its 
customers. Operating in the US and Europe, the combined group will 
have an enhanced ability to attract customers from land-based vacations 
to cruise vacations. 
* Carnival expects that the proposed combination will generate 
significant synergies to the benefit of both shareholders and 
customers. These savings are expected to come by sharing the best 
practices of the two management teams to achieve efficiencies from, 
inter alia, purchasing, marketing and information systems, and also 
from rationalising support operations in locations served by both 
companies. 
* The Enlarged Carnival Group will benefit from the financial flexibility 
of the combined group's strong balance sheet and cash flow. Carnival 
believes that the terms of the Offer will ensure that the proposed 
combination of Carnival and P&O Princess would retain a strong 
financial position with an investment 
grade credit rating. 
* Carnival believes that P&O Princess Shareholders would be better served 
through a combination with Carnival than with Royal Caribbean. The 
greater strength of Carnival's management team is evidenced by a 
comparison of the financial and operating performance of Royal 
Caribbean and Carnival: 
-- Carnival shareholder returns have consistently outperformed those 
of Royal Caribbean; 
-- Carnival's operational measures are consistently and significantly 
better than those of Royal Caribbean; and 
-- Carnival has significantly greater balance sheet strength and 
flexibility than Royal Caribbean. 
* Carnival believes that its Offer bears no greater regulatory risk than 
the Royal Caribbean Proposal. Carnival believes, as Royal Caribbean 
and P&O Princess have already stated, that cruise operators compete in 
a broad vacation market, rather than simply a cruise market and, 
accordingly, both companies undertake substantial efforts to attract 
consumers from other vacation options. Carnival believes that Carnival 
and Royal Caribbean are similarly situated within the wider vacation 
market based on all meaningful comparators. Carnival has examined the

Page 59 of 78 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
requirements for approval and has received advice from its external 
antitrust advisors that the likelihood of Carnival achieving a 
favourable regulatory outcome in the EU and US is no less than that of 
the Royal Caribbean Proposal. 
The Royal Caribbean Proposal is Disadvantageous to 
P&O Princess Shareholders 
* Under the Royal Caribbean Proposal P&O Princess Shareholders do not 
receive any premium or cash consideration. 
* Under the Royal Caribbean Proposal P&O Princess Shareholders will own 
50.7 per cent. of the combined entity but, based on selected analysts' 
forecasts, P&O Princess is expected to contribute significantly more 
than this proportion to the combined entity's net income before 
synergies. Accordingly, a disproportionate share of the earnings, as 
well as the synergy benefits, is expected to accrue to Royal Caribbean 
Shareholders rather than to P&O Princess Shareholders. 
* Royal Caribbean is highly geared and currently has a sub-investment 
grade credit rating. Given the uncertain economic environment, as well 
as the significant capital commitments that Royal Caribbean and 
P&O Princess have made, Carnival believes that a strong and flexible 
balance sheet is essential. P&O Princess's credit rating has already 
been downgraded in anticipation of the Royal Caribbean Proposal. 
Carnival believes that the Royal Caribbean Proposal does not compensate 
P&O Princess Shareholders for the extra financial risk P&O Princess 
would bear if the transaction were consummated. 
* The most senior management position in the combined group has been 
awarded to the Royal Caribbean Chairman and CEO. However, 
P&O Princess's operational and financial performance has been superior 
to that of Royal Caribbean, which has lagged both Carnival and 
P&O Princess. Carnival believes that P&O Princess Shareholders should 
consider whether the decision to appoint Royal Caribbean's Chairman and 
CEO to the most senior position in the combined group is in their best 
interests. 
* Carnival believes that the complex DLC structure in the Royal Caribbean 
Proposal may constrain P&O Princess's ability to raise capital, make 
acquisitions and engage in other corporate activity. Furthermore, 
there can be no assurance that P&O Princess will not trade at a 
discount to Royal Caribbean after the Royal Caribbean Proposal has been 
implemented. 
* Carnival firmly believes that the Joint Venture and the Break Fee, both 
entered into without shareholder approval, have the effect of depriving 
P&O Princess Shareholders of the full value of their shares. Both 
agreements deviate from permitted norms in public UK takeovers and 
mergers. Carnival would have been able to offer a higher price to 
P&O Princess Shareholders had these "poison pills" not been put in 
place. 
General 
Micky Arison, the Chairman and Chief Executive of Carnival, said: 
"We believe our proposal is clearly more favourable to P&O Princess Shareholders than the Royal Caribbean 
deal. We are offering a substantial premium and we are a much stronger partner for P&O Princess, both 
financially and operationally." 
There will be a UK and European analysts' presentation at 9.00 a.m. (GMT) and a press briefing at 1.00 p.m. on

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
Certain statements in this announcement constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the 
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Carnival has tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements 
by using words such as "anticipate," "assume," "believe," "expect," "intend," "plan" and words and terms of similar 
substance in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. These forward-looking 
statements, including those which may impact the forecasting of Carnival's net revenue yields, booking levels, 
price, occupancy or business prospects, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which 
may cause Carnival's actual results, performances or achievements to be materially different from any future 
results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors 
include, among others, the following: general economic and business conditions which may impact levels of 
disposable income of consumers and the net revenue yields for Carnival's cruise products; consumer demand for 
cruises and other vacation options; other vacation industry competition; effects on consumer demand of armed 
conflicts, political instability, terrorism, the availability of air service and adverse media publicity; increases in 
cruise industry and vacation industry capacity; continued availability of attractive port destinations; changes in tax 
laws and regulations; Carnival's ability to implement its shipbuilding program and to continue to expand its 
business outside the North American market; Carnival's ability to attract and retain shipboard crew; changes in 
foreign currency rates, security expenses, food, fuel, insurance and commodity prices and interest rates; delivery 
of new ships on schedule and at the contracted prices; weather patterns; unscheduled ship repairs and 
dry-docking; incidents involving cruise ships; impact of pending or threatened litigation; and changes in laws and 
regulations applicable to Carnival. 
Carnival cautions the reader that these risks may not be exhaustive. Carnival operates in a continually changing 
business environment, and new risks emerge from time to time. Carnival cannot predict such risks nor can it 
assess the impact, if any, of such risks on its business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks may 
cause actual results to differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking 
statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. Carnival undertakes no obligation to 
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or 
otherwise. 
Carnival plans to file a registration statement on form S-4 and a statement on schedule to with the US Securities 
and Exchange Commission in connection with the offer. The form S-4 will contain a prospectus and other 
documents relating to the offer. Carnival plans to mail the prospectus contained in the form S-4 to shareholders of 
Port when the form S-4 is filed with the SEC. The form S-4, the prospectus and the schedule to will contain 
important information about Carnival, Port, the Offer and related matters. Investors and stockholders should read 
the form S-4, the prospectus, the schedule to and the other documents filed with the SEC in connection with the

Carnival Corp. Bids for London-Based P&O Princess Cruises 
Carnival Corp. Bids for London-Based P&O Princess Cruises 
Ina Paiva Cordle 
772 words 
17 December 2001 
KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: The Miami Herald - Florida 
KRTBN 
English 
Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World Reporter (TM) 
Two Miami cruise lines -- Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. -- are now competing to merge with 
London-based P&O Princess Cruises, with the victor taking the crown as the largest cruise business in the 
world. 
Three weeks after Royal Caribbean and P&O Princess announced a proposed merger, Carnival Corp. has made 
a bid for the British line. 
P&O Princess said Sunday that it had rejected Carnival's proposal, but Carnival isn't giving up. The company said 
it will now appeal directly to P&O Princess shareholders -- touting its conditional offer as the better deal, while 
firing shots at Royal Caribbean's financial performance and leadership. 
The two Miami cruise giants are fighting for nothing less than dominance in the cruise industry. The combination 
of Carnival and P&O Princess would create a company with 62 ships and 98,000 berths, while a Royal 
Caribbean-Princess deal would mean 41 ships and 75,000 berths. 
Carnival revealed Sunday that it would offer $2.91 in cash and 0.1361 Carnival shares for each P&O Princess 
share on Thursday, a value of $4.6 billion. The bid, subject to financing and regulatory approvals, represents a 27 
percent premium over the closing middle market price of P&O shares on Friday. 
"We believe that our proposal is in the best interest of P&O Princess Cruises' shareholders," Carnival Chairman 
Micky Arison, who was in London and could not be reached late Sunday, said in a statement. "The proposed 
combination of Carnival Corp. and P&O Princess Cruises creates a global vacation and leisure company with an 
enhanced offering of complementary brands and greater geographic reach." 
Scott Barry, leisure analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said Carnival has nothing to lose by attempting a 
hostile takeover: At worst, it will delay the regulatory approval process for Royal Caribbean and P&O Princess, 
and at best, it gains a cruise line. 
"If they take it to the shareholders, they have the balance sheet and the wherewithal to do the deal; that is 
certainly not an issue," Barry said. "And the strategic rationale for the combination is compelling." 
P&O Princess said that it had carefully reviewed Carnival's offer over the weekend and concluded that Royal 
Caribbean's deal "remains the most attractive alternative for P&O Princess shareholders." 
P&O Princess said Carnival's proposal would not offer shareholders "the value and upside potential" it expects 
from the Royal Caribbean deal. Because of Carnival's size and greater presence in Europe, P&O Princess said a 
Carnival acquisition would be subject to greater regulatory risk in the United States and the European Union. 
P&O Princess, which needs 75 percent of its shareholders to approve the Royal Caribbean combination, still 
recommends that deal. And Royal Caribbean is fighting it out. 
"We are very pleased with the transaction we have on the table," said Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Lynn 
Martenstein. "And we think it is in the best interest of both sets of shareholders." 
Royal Caribbean has 2,000 employees in Miami and Carnival has about 1,850. 
Royal Caribbean and P&O Princess announced their proposed merger in late November, in a deal worth $6 
billion that would create the world's largest cruise company. 
The combined entity, based in Miami, would usurp crosstown rival Carnival Corp.'s top position in an industry still 
struggling from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Page 64 of 78 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
If the deal works out, P&O Princess would own 50.7 percent of the new group, with Royal Caribbean taking 49.3 
percent. The companies have $6 billion in market capitalization and $5 billion in combined revenue for the year 
that ended Sept. 30. 
Analysts fully expected Carnival -- which ranks as the largest cruise line today, with 44 ships and 61,000 berths -- 
to make its own move on Princess. 
Carnival said it has made several approaches to P&O Princess in the past two years -- most recently on Sept. 24, 
less than nine weeks before the proposed Royal Caribbean merger was announced. 
In his statement, Arison said the Royal Caribbean proposal "would leave P&O Princess shareholders with an 
investment in a less attractive entity with greater financial risk." 
He also questions naming Royal Caribbean's chief executive, Richard Fain, as CEO of the combined group, 
saying Royal Caribbean's operational and financial performance has lagged behind P&O Princess's and 
Carnival's.

Setting the stage for a battle of the cruise-ship giants, P&O Princess Cruises PLC yesterday rejected a GBP 3.2 
billion (US$4.61 billion) hostile takeover proposal from Carnival Corp. and reaffirmed its merger plans with Royal 
Caribbean Cruise Lines Ltd. 
P&O Princess, the world's third largest cruise operator, said its board rejected Carnival's informal offer after 
concluding that its current merger plans with No. 2 Royal Caribbean remain the most attractive alternative for its 
shareholders. Industry leader Carnival had sent its proposal in a letter to P&O Princess late last week. Carnival 
and Royal Caribbean are based in Miami, and P&O is in London. 
P&O Princess announced its merger with Royal Caribbean last month. Structured as a merger of equals, that 
deal offered little or no premium and valued the companies at about their market values. P&O currently has a 
market capitalization of about $3.6 billion, while Royal Caribbean's is about $3.1 billion. The deal would give 
Princess shareholders 50.7% of the equity of the new company, compared with 49.3% for Royal Caribbean 
holders. 
Despite the greater premium of the Carnival proposal, P&O Princess argued that it would carry greater regulatory 
risk and provide fewer benefits to P&O shareholders than the planned combination of P&O and Royal Caribbean. 
The Carnival proposal marks a step toward further consolidation in an industry that has been in the throes of 
merger mania for years and is now set to dwindle to two dominant players amid a severe round of pricing 
pressure following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A combined Carnival-Princess would likely draw close antitrust 
scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic because it would create a cruise-ship giant with 62 ships and 87,020 berths, 
well above a rival Royal Caribbean's 23 cruise ships and 47,400 berths. A combination of Royal Caribbean and 
P&O Princess would have 41 ships and 75,000 berths. 
As part of its proposal, Carnival is offering 200 pence (U.S.$2.88) in cash and 0.1361 Carnival share for each 
P&O Princess share, valuing the company at about GBP 3.2 billion, based on Carnival's closing price of $27.30, 
up 56 cents, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday. The value of Carnival's offer is about 
456 pence a share, representing a 27% premium to P&O Princess Cruises' closing price of 360 pence in trading 
on the London Stock Exchange Friday. 
"This deal from our point of view is our last opportunity to expand and pick up brands that are attractive," said 
Carnival Chief Executive Micky Arison in an interview yesterday evening, adding that Princess is the second 
best-known brand in the U.S. and No. 1 in Europe. 
After receiving the Princess board's rejection letter Sunday evening, Mr. Arison and Howard Frank, Carnival's vice 
chairman, plan to make their case directly to Princess shareholders. The two executives were in London 
yesterday evening and plan to meet with Princess shareholders there today. "The only ones that can be losers 
here are the Princess shareholders if they don't take the opportunity of getting a better deal," said Mr. Arison. 
Mr. Arison was dismissive of the notion that a Carnival-Princess deal would face greater regulatory hurdles than a 
Royal Caribbean-Princess merger. He said Royal Caribbean's and Carnival's comparable brands are very similar 
in size and scope. "There's no difference in the areas that we compete in in North America," he said, adding that 
the European cruise industry is a "fractured marketplace." 
Carnival had hoped to engage P&O Princess in friendly negotiations but the letter from P&O's board yesterday 
evening made it appear that Carnival would have to launch a hostile offer to win control of the company.

In its letter to P&O Princess, Carnival said it had had a number of discussions in recent years with the London 
company about a possible combination -- the most recent being on Sept. 24 when Carnival's vice chairman, Mr. 
Frank, called P&O Princess's Chief Executive Peter Ratcliffe to pursue a combination of the two groups. "We tried 
for two and a half years to do a friendly transaction," said Mr. Arison. 
In rejecting the bid, P&O Princess said that its board concluded that the Carnival proposal isn't as favorable 
financially to P&O shareholders and would face greater regulatory risk in the U.S. and Europe than the 
transaction with Royal Caribbean. P&O argued also that Carnival's proposal doesn't represent a formal offer since 
it would be contingent on the companies' getting prior regulatory approval. 
P&O Princess also said a combination with Carnival wouldn't provide the same level of benefits and upside to 
P&O shareholders that would be generated through a merger with Royal. Previously, P&O and Royal estimated 
cost savings of as much as $100 million from their planned merger. 
"Our response to Carnival is based on two clear criteria -- value for our shareholders and deliverability," said Mr. 
Ratcliffe. "The proposal falls short on both counts." 
A Royal Caribbean spokeswoman said: "We're very pleased with the transaction we have on the table. We think it 
is in the best interest of both sets of shareholders." 
Carnival isn't averse to a battle. It went up against Royal Caribbean in 1997, when Royal agreed to acquire 
Celebrity Cruises. Carnival tried to intervene, but Royal eventually won the bid. 
Carnival holds a 36% share of the North American cruise market, while Princess holds 11%. Like the Royal 
Caribbean-Princess deal, the question of antitrust clearance is likely to turn on whether regulators view the 
companies as giants in the cruise industry or small players in the larger tourism market. Royal Caribbean and 
P&O Princess sought to argue that the combined company would compete against land-based resorts and hotels 
-- or the much bigger travel industry. 
UBS Warburg and Merrill Lynch & Co. are advising Carnival on its informal offer.

LONDON - P&O Princess Cruises PLC said yesterday it rejected an offer by U.S. rival Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. 
to buy the No. 1 cruise ship operator for about US$4.7-billion in cash and shares. 
Carnival offered to pay 200 pence in cash and 0.1361 Carnival share per Princess Cruises share, the U.S. 
company said in a faxed statement. 
The offer, which was made in a letter on Thursday, valued Princess Cruises at 450 pence a share, 25% more 
than the stock's closing price on Friday. 
P&O Princess, which agreed last month to buy Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. for US$7.4-billion, said Carnival's 
proposed bid did not offer shareholder value and was subject to greater regulatory risk in the European Union and 
the United States than the Caribbean acquisition. 
"Our response to Carnival is based on two clear criteria -- value for our shareholders and deliverability," said 
Peter Ratcliffe, P&O Princess chief executive. "Their proposal falls short on both counts." 
P&O Princess Cruises agreed to buy Royal Caribbean to become the biggest cruise ship company. The merger 
would cut costs as travel slumps after the terrorist attacks on the United States. By merging, the companies could 
combine marketing and reservation services. The new company would control 37% of the cruise berths 
worldwide, Credit Suisse First Boston said. 
The board of P&O Princess, which was given until 6:00 p.m. London time today to respond to Carnival, met over 
the weekend to discuss the proposal. In rejecting the bid, the board said Carnival had not made an "irrevocable 
commitment" to make and maintain an offer and the board would continue to recommend the Royal Caribbean 
transaction to shareholders. 
As a condition to proceeding with its offer, Miami-based Carnival said in its letter that P&O Princess must 
recommend to its shareholders to vote against the Royal Caribbean transaction. Carnival would also have to get 
regulatory approval from the EU and the United States and line up financing for its bid. 
The cash consideration of Carnival's offer would be financed through cash on hand and new credit facilities. The 
company currently has US$2.4-billion in cash and credit lines, according to its letter, written by Micky Arison, 
chief executive of Carnival. 
The U.K. company was advised by Citigroup Inc.'s Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, P&O Princess said in a 
statement. UBS Warburg LLC, the investment banking arm of Switzerland's UBS AG, is advising Carnival, 
according to people familiar with the matter.

CARNIVAL Corporation, the world's biggest cruise company, will today gatecrash the merger of its two arch-rivals 
with a #3.2 billion counter-bid for P&O Princess Cruises. 
The offer was dismissed last night by P&O Princess, which insisted that its "merger of equals" with Royal 
Caribbean, announced last month, remains "the most attractive alternative", setting the scene for a festive fight. 
Under the terms of the deal, Carnival is offering 456p per P&O Princess share - 200p in cash and 0.1361 in 
shares. They closed unchanged at 360p on Friday, valuing the company at #2.5 billion, double their 12-month low 
of 180p in September. 
P&O maintains that the offer by Carnival, which is based in Miami, offers greater regulatory risk, even though its 
merger with Royal Caribbean was also bound to be subject to close regulatory scrutiny. 
Carnival's bid is likely to trigger an anti-trust investigation in the US and a further review by European Union 
competition authorities. Royal Caribbean and P&O Princess are respectively the second-and third-largest cruise 
lines. 
Either way, the battle for leadership in the cruise industry is bound to be an expensive fight for all parties. Under 
the merger terms, $62.5m ( #43m) was payable by either party "in certain circumstances" if the transaction is 
scuppered. There was also a change of ownership liability, potentially $200m, relating to a change of 
management at their new joint venture in southern Europe. 
Carnival is prepared to increase its offer if P&O Princess is able to negotiate a reduction in these costs, although 
it did not specify how high it is prepared to go. 
Lord Sterling of Plaistow, chairman of P&O Princess, said: "Our response to Carnival simply recognises that their 
proposition will not deliver the same value for our shareholders." 
But Micky Arison, chairman and chief executive of Carnival, said: "We are a much stronger partner for P&O 
Princess, both financially and operationally." 
Carnival, which is being advised by Merrill Lynch and UBS Warburg, also held talks with P&O Princess two years 
ago that came to nothing. It contacted the company at the end of last week, according to P&O, although Carnival 
claims to have first telephoned the company on September 24 but did not get a call back. 
P&O Princess has been locked in discussions with its advisers, Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, throughout the 
weekend. After concluding the deal was not acceptable, it wrote to Carnival to reject the proposal. 
It was on November 20 that P&O Princess and Royal Caribbean announced their plans for "a merger of equals", 
as it was billed, in a move which would have created the world's largest cruise group. 
The combined company hoped for cost savings of more than $100m each year, such as the combining of its 
Alaskan tour operations. Richard Fain, chairman and chief executive of Royal Caribbean, would have assumed 
the same role at the combined company. Peter Ratcliffe, chief executive of P&O Princess, would have been 
managing director and chief operating officer.

GKN, following the strong performance of its shares since the autumn.

Setting the stage for a battle of the cruise-ship giants, P&O Princess Cruises PLC Sunday rejected a 3.2 billion 
pound ($4.61 billion or 5.16 billion euro) hostile takeover offer from Carnival Corp. and reaffirmed its merger plans 
with Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines Ltd. 
P&O Princess (POC), the world's third-largest cruise operator, said its board rejected Carnival's informal offer

As part of its proposal, Carnival is offering 200 pence (US$2.88 or 3.22 euros) in cash and 0.1361 Carnival share 
for each P&O Princess share, valuing the company at about 3.2 billion pounds, based on Carnival's closing price 
of $27.30 a share, up 56 cents, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Market composite trading Friday. The value of 
Carnival's offer is about 456 pence a share, representing a 27% premium to P&O Princess Cruises' closing price

HELSINKI, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. cruise group Carnival Corp. said on Tuesday it was open to acquisitions in the 
aftermath of the big cross-Atlantic merger of P&O Princess Cruises Plc and Caribbean Cruises Ltd. 
"We are open to discussions with virtually anyone out there," Carnival Chief Executive Micky Arison told Reuters 
on the sidelines of a news conference in Helsinki. 
P&O Princess Cruises Plc and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd have announced plans to merge and displace 
Carnival as the world's largest cruise group. 
Cruising, like the travel industry overall, has been hard hit since the September 11 attacks that has left travellers 
wary and forced some firms into bankrutpcy. 
"It is likely there will be more consolidation as companies view their balance sheets to be at risk and it will 
accelerate what was already happening in the industry," Arison said. 
"We do not have a balance sheet at risk but others who do might come to us (to be taken over)," he added. 
Carnival has lured passengers with discount tickets but expects this would hit profits at least through early 2002. 
Arison said the uncertain international climate with the ongoing war in Afghanistan and warnings from U.S. 
officals of possible further attacks against the United States made it tough to say when there will be a rebound. 
"We are going into our heaviest booking period after the holidays... and it will be a few weeks into that when we 
have some better sense of pricing," Arison said. 
He also reiterated that ship deliveries next year would not be delayed but said that deliveries in 2003 and 2004 
may be delayed.

Will No. 1 Carnival Corp. sit by as its top rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and P&O Princess Cruises PLC 
plan a merger? 
The proposed transaction, valued at about $3 billion (3.41 billion euros), would create the world's largest cruise 
concern with 41 ships and some 75,000 berths, leapfrogging Carnival's top slot. Despite a $62.5 million breakup 
fee and a planned joint venture between No. 2 Royal Caribbean and No. 3 Princess that would be nettlesome to 
dissolve, some on Wall Street predict Carnival may emerge with its own bid for Princess. 
"There's a realistic chance that Carnival comes in," said one portfolio manager with a Carnival stake who declined 
to be identified. 
"They're very closely looking at the deal and weighing their options." Robin Farley, an analyst with UBS Warburg 
in New York, who thinks Carnival may intervene, points out that Carnival approached Princess about an 
acquisition in the past. 
The combination, unveiled Tuesday, comes as the cruise industry is struggling to fill a rapidly expanding fleet of 
ships even as the weak economy and a fear of travel have crimped demand. Prices have fallen so low that cruise 
executives joke that it is cheaper to take a three-day Caribbean cruise than to take a family to dinner. 
Miami-based Royal Caribbean and London-based Princess hope to slash costs and strengthen their marketing 
position amid the heavy pricing pressures. 
Analysts say Carnival can handle the current stormy seas alone. The company already has a portfolio of six 
cruise brands, spanning prices from the budget to the ultra-luxury and regions from the Caribbean to Alaska to 
the Mediterranean. 
Carnival also has time and money on its side. It is the industry's most profitable company and has $3.3 billion in 
cash and credit lines. "We've got a strong balance sheet, strong cash flows and operating margins," Howard 
Frank, Carnival's vice chairman, said in an interview Tuesday. "We can sit back and watch this thing develop and 
figure out what's best for us." 
Royal Caribbean's chairman and chief executive officer, Richard D. Fain, who will hold those posts at the 
combined companies, said he couldn't predict what Carnival would do, but he hopes they will see it as a "good 
thing for the industry." A spokesman for the two companies asserted that Carnival would have "significant 
antitrust issues if they attempt to bid for one of the two merger partners." 
The transaction still faces shareholder and regulatory approval. It is expected to draw regulatory scrutiny in the 
U.S., Germany and Britain. One key question is whether regulators will see the companies as large operators in 
the cruise niche or tiny players in the bigger leisure-travel market. 
Some on Wall Street point out that Carnival may be better off waiting to see how those questions are resolved. 
"I'm not sure it would be the most prudent thing to wage a takeover battle when they're not even sure if will get 
through," said Tim Fidler, a portfolio manager at Ariel Capital Management, which has held Carnival shares for

Page 74 of 78 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
about 10 years. Mr. Fidler agreed that Carnival isn't pressured to act. "I don't see any reason why they would 
have to -- not from an operating standpoint and definitely not from a financial standpoint." 
Even though Royal Caribbean and Princess estimate cost savings of $100 million in the combination, analysts 
say they still won't approach Carnival's low-cost structure. 
Carnival might also benefit as its rivals are preoccupied with integrating the two cruise lines. "The cultures of 
these businesses are very different . . . They will go through tremendous transitions to get the economies of 
scale," said Mr. Frank. Carnival, he predicted, will have a "huge competitive advantage" over the companies as 
they focus on merger issues. 
But despite all of its "wait-and-see" talk, Carnival is known as an aggressive acquirer that isn't averse to hostile 
transactions. In 1997 when Royal Caribbean agreed to acquire Celebrity Cruises, Carnival briefly interloped with 
a proposal of its own, but quickly backed off, allowing the acquisition to be completed. Then in 1999, Carnival 
approached Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Co. about buying its Princess unit, but was rebuffed. P&O 
later spun off the cruise operations. 
In December 1999, Carnival launched a hostile takeover bid for NCL Holding ASA, the parent of Norwegian 
Cruise Lines, but was eventually outmaneuvered by Star Cruises PLC of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

say they won't approach Carnival's low-cost structure. 
Carnival might also benefit as its rivals are preoccupied with integrating the two cruise concerns. "The cultures of 
these businesses are very different. . . . They will go through tremendous transitions to get the economies of 
scale," Mr. Frank said. Carnival, he predicted, will have a "huge competitive advantage" over the companies as 
they focus on merger issues. 
But despite all of its "wait-and-see" talk, Carnival is known as an aggressive acquirer that isn't averse to hostile 
transactions. In 1997 when Royal Caribbean agreed to acquire Celebrity Cruises, Carnival tried to intervene but 
quickly backed off, allowing the acquisition to be completed. Then, in 1999, Carnival approached Peninsular & 
Oriental Steam Navigation Co. about buying its Princess unit, but was rebuffed. P&O later spun off the cruise 
operations. 
In December 1999, Carnival launched a hostile-takeover bid for NCL Holding ASA, the parent of Norwegian 
Cruise Lines, but eventually was outmaneuvered by Star Cruises Ltd. of Hong Kong.

SHARES of Airtours hit turbulence yesterday after confirmation that Carnival Corporation, its biggest shareholder, 
had decided to offload its 25.1 per cent stake, worth about #360 million. 
The move reignited speculation that Carnival, the world's biggest cruise operator, could use its increased 
firepower to bid for P&O Princess Cruises, the number three operator. P&O Princess rose 9 1/2p to 357p, 
valuing it at almost #2.5 billion. 
Carnival, which owns the Cunard and Seabourn lines, said it had decided to bale out "following a shift in Airtours's 
corporate strategy resulting from the purchase of Travel Services International (TSI) last year". TSI sells a large 
number of cruises operated by Carnival's closest rivals. 
Micky Arison, Carnival's chairman, said its purchase last September of Airtours's 50 per cent stake in Costa 
Crociere, an Italian cruise operator jointly owned by the two companies, was another factor. "The strategic 
reasons for Carnival's continued minority ownership in Airtours are no longer compelling," he said. 
David Crossland, Airtours's chairman, denied any hint of a falling out, saying that TSI would continue to account 
for 10 per cent of Carnival's total sales. "We married young and now we don't have anything in common any 
more. It is a very happy and amicable divorce." 
Under a standstill agreement signed when Carnival bought the stake for 158p a share in 1996, it would not have 
been free to sell until September. However, with Airtours's agreement it has started placing shares with 
institutions through UBS Warburg and Deutsche Bank and expects to complete the process within the next day or 
so. 
The announcement sent Airtours's shares tumbling from 292p to 268p in early trading, although it later recovered 
to close just 5p lower at 287p as the market focused on the solid half-year results that accompanied the 
announcement. 
In the half year to March 31, seasonal losses before tax widened from #81.7 million to #97.6 million after 
expansion and its increased share of losses in Germany after the purchase of full control of FTi. Turnover was up 
32 per cent to #2.1 billion and the interim dividend rises to 2p (1.8p). 
It said total group bookings for summer 2001 were 4 per cent ahead, and 13 per cent ahead in the UK.
