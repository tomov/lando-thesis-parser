America's largest paper-maker, International Paper (IP), has acquired US rival Union Camp (UC) in an all-stock 
deal worth #3.9bn ($6.6bn) including debt. 
The deal is expected to save the companies up to #180.7m - through job cuts and possible plant closures - within 
a year of its completion, which is forecast for the end of the first quarter of 1999. 
IP will inherit low-cost operations in key linerboard and uncoated free sheet paper grades as a result of the 
merger. "It's a perfect fit," beamed IP chairman John Dillon. 
UK paper producers have benefited from speculation that other bids may materialise: shares in Arjo Wiggins 
climbed 9.5p to 120p; Rexam was up 10.5p at 216p; and Bunzl jumped by 11p to 270p.

International Paper, the largest US paper manufacturer, is buying Union Camp, one of its competitors, in an 
agreed all-stock deal valued at $6.6bn, including debt. The move triggered a wave of speculation on Wall Street 
that the long-expected consolidation in the US paper industry was at last under way. 
Separately, Smurfit-Stone Container, the company formed last week by the $1.35bn merger of Jefferson Smurfit 
with Stone Container, announced a restructuring that would involve cutting about 10% of its 36,000 workers. It will 
take a charge of between $300m and $350m, and reduce its annual US container board capacity. 
The Union Camp deal will also involve cost cutting, with the companies predicting $300m in savings within a year 
of completing the deal by rationalising facilities and reducing overheads. Last year Union Camp had sales of 
$4.4bn, while International Paper had sales of $20.1bn. 
John Dillon, International Paper's chief executive, said: "The world has been waiting for something like this. It's a 
step in the consolidation of the worldwide paper industry." Outside the US in the past two years there has been 
consolidation in the industry, with mergers by Canadian and Scandinavian companies. However, the International 
Paper deal, which values Union Camp at $71 per share - a huge premium to its share price of $48 15/16 
immediately before the deal was announced - is the biggest merger in the US paper industry. 
In afternoon trading Union Camp's shares were up $15 15/16 to $64 7/8, while International Paper's shares 
eased $1 to $43 7/8. Smurfit-Stone gained $1 9/16 to $14 1/8.

NEW YORK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - International Paper Co., the world's largest paper and forest products company, 
said on Tuesday it would buy smaller rival Union Camp Corp. in a stock swap worth $6.6 billion, including 
assumption of debt. 
Purchase, N.Y.-based International Paper said it would exchange $71 of its stock for each share of Union Camp, 
the nation's No. 9 paper company with $4.4 billion in sales in 1997. 
"This deal is not about size," International Paper Chairman John Dillon said in a conference call. "This was about 
creating a stronger company with greater value for our shareholders," he said, adding his company approached 
Union Camp nearly a month ago with the proposal. 
Wall Street analysts and traders said they expected more consolidation in the paper industry, pushing the sector's 
shares higher on Tuesday. Union Camp jumped $16 to close at $64.94 and was the second-biggest gainer on 
the New York Stock Exchange. But International Paper slipped $1.69 to $44 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
"This really begins to put pressure on other paper companies to become serious about deal-making," said Kathy 
McAuley, analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. 
The companies said they expected the merger to boost earnings in the first full year of combined operations and 
result in $300 million in cost savings. The deal is subject to approval by regulators and shareholders of both 
companies. 
International Paper said some of the savings would come from job cuts but declined to be specific. 
"There will be some consolidation of staff activities associated with the savings," Marianne Parrs, chief financial 
officer of International Paper, said by telephone. 
"But we have not put any specific numbers on what they might come to. In the context of the combined company, 
we're not talking about all that many people," added Parrs, referring to the 80,000 employees of IP and 18,000 
Union Camp workers. 
"It's also quite likely that there will be charges associated with achieving the savings, but its too early for us to 
have any numbers," she said. 
The merged company will have 22 percent of the domestic market for paper used for writing, computer printing 
and photocopying, dwarfing the next largest player, Georgia-Pacific Corp. with a 13 percent share, Brown 
Brothers' McAuley said. 
The acquisition comes after International Paper has been divesting some businesses over the past year. It has 
raised $2 billion from such sales since 1996 and said in August it would sell another $500 million in assets over 
the next 12 months. 
The U.S. paper industry, plagued by overcapacity and low returns on capital, has been slow to consolidate. Some 
deals, did materialise this year, including U.S. newsprint producer Bowater Inc.'s purchase of Canada's Avenor 
for $2.4 billion. 
Analysts said lower paper prices, due in part to Asia's economic crisis, will force more paper companies to 
restructure and consolidate. But they were not holding their breath.

"There are certainly indications that we will see more consolidations," BT Alex. Brown analyst Mark Wilde said. 
"But we've been waiting several years for the dam to break." 
He said container board and white-paper producers such as Champion and Boise-Cascade were merger 
candidates. 
The move also propels International Paper into the top producer ranks of container and linerboard, used for 
packaging goods ranging from televisions to fruit, with a 14 percent U.S. market share, McAuley said. 
The biggest producer in that area is Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., which said Tuesday it will cut up to 3,600 
jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, and take a $350 million charge in a restructuring. 
Three members of Union Camp's board of directors, including Chairman W. Craig McClelland, will join IP's 
board. IP's Dillon will continue as chairman and CEO. 
IP was advised by CS First Boston in the deal and Goldman Sachs advised Union Camp, Dillon said.

PURCHASE, N.Y., Nov 24 (Reuters) - International Paper Co., the world's largest forest and paper products 
company, said on Tuesday it had agreed to acquire competitor Union Camp Corp. in a stock swap worth $6.6 
billion, including assumed debt. 
International Paper said it would exchange $71 of its stock for each share of Union Camp, whose stockholders 
will own 25 percent of the merged companies. Union Camp shares closed at $48.94 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading Monday. International Paper finished at $45.81. 
International Paper said it expects the deal to close at the end of the 1999 first quarter. The merger is expected to 
boost earnings in the first full year of combined operations and result in $300 million in cost savings, the 
companies said. Union Camp is among the top 10 paper and packaging companies. 
The acquisition marks a turnabout from International Paper's strategy of jettisoning underperforming businesses 
over the past year. It has raised more than $1 million from divestitures and said in August it would sell an 
additional $500 million in assets over the next 12 months. 
The U.S. paper industry, plagued by overcapacity and low returns on capital, has been slow to consolidate. Some 
deals, however, materialised this year, including U.S. newsprint producer Bowater Inc. buying Canada's Avenor 
for $2.4 billion. Analysts say lower paper prices, due in part to Asia's economic crisis, will force more paper 
companies to restructure and consolidate. 
Three members of Union Camp's board of directors, including W. Craig McClelland, the company's chairman and 
chief executive officer, will join International Paper's board when the merger closes. International Paper's top 
executive, John Dillon will continue as chairman and chief executive officer.

Intl Paper-Union Camp -2: Most Savings From Overhead Cuts 
Intl Paper-Union Camp -2: Most Savings From Overhead Cuts

Most of the $300 million in expected cost savings from the merger of Union Camp and International Paper will 
come from cuts in overhead, International Paper executives said Tuesday afternoon. 
During a conference call with reporters, International Paper Chairman and Chief Executive John Dillon said 
about $200 million of the total will come from overhead cuts. He didn't say what portion of this amount would be 
derived from layoffs, but acknowledged that "there obviously will be, as we put the two companies together, a 
reduction in personnel." 
Of the remaining $100 million in anticipated cost savings, about $65 million will come from process improvements 
and facility rationalizations and about $35 million from purchasing and logistics savings. 
Dillon and his counterpart from Union Camp, W. Craig McClelland, extolled the benefits of the merger. 
McClelland said he wasn't looking for a partner until he was approached by Dillon. But once the two started 
talking, McClelland said, he was tempted by the near- and long-term benefits of a merger. 
The companies denied that they had been spooked into merging by the less-than-favorable conditions that their 
industry has been facing. Marianne Parrs, International Paper's chief financial officer, conceded that the current 
market environment - where prices have been pressured by the economic turmoil seen around the world - has 
been "difficult for the forest products industry," but maintained that "the short-term market environment is not what 
we had in mind when we decided to form this combination of companies." 
The merger is expected to be accretive to International Paper's earnings in the first full year of operations. But as 
with any merger, there are always some questions. Mark Wilde, an analyst at BT Alex. Brown Inc., wondered at 
International Paper's decision to make a large acquisition at this time, pointing out that the company "has been 
struggling to tighten up" its own operations. "Is bigger better if you don't manage what you have well already?" he 
asked. 
Wilde also raised an eyebrow at the price International Paper paid, which he called "a very full price." But he also 
said Union Camp has some assets that could be disposed as time goes on and a healthy amount of overhead 
that can be trimmed. 
International Paper was advised by Credit Suisse First Boston Corp., 
while 
Union Camp was advised by Goldman Sachs & Co.
