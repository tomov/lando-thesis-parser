2011 DEC 30 - (VerticalNews.com) -- During a meeting with investors and analysts, United Technologies Corp. 
(NYSE: UTX) Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Louis Chenevert today reaffirmed the company's expectation 
for 2011 earnings per share of $5.47 on sales of approximately $58 billion. For UTC's base business excluding 
the impact of the previously announced agreement to acquire Goodrich Corp., Chenevert also projected 2012 
earnings per share of $5.80 to $6.00, up 6 to 10 percent. Including $0.40 of dilution related to the Goodrich 
acquisition and an additional $0.10 of headwind from the absence of share repurchase, 2012 earnings per share 
are expected to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.50. The Goodrich acquisition is expected to close in mid 2012. 
Excluding the pending Goodrich acquisition, sales for 2012 are expected to be $59 to $60 billion, including 2 to 4 
percent organic growth. The company continues to anticipate cash flow from operations less capital expenditures 
will exceed net income attributable to common shareowners in 2011 and anticipates it will be equal to or in 
excess of net income attributable to common shareowners in 2012. 
"We expect 2012 will be a transformational year for United Technologies, as we leverage our new organizational 
structure to provide additional customer value and complete the acquisitions of Goodrich and of Rolls-Royce's 
share of the International Aero Engines joint venture," Chenevert said. 
"In 2012, we expect moderate economic growth driven mainly by emerging markets, and four of our five business 
units expect solid organic sales growth," Chenevert continued. "Relentless focus on cost reduction and 
productivity while investing in innovative technologies will position us to grow earnings per share 6 to 10 percent 
in 2012, excluding Goodrich, despite significant pension and foreign exchange headwinds. 
"As the commercial aerospace OEMs increase production, we see tremendous opportunity resulting from the 
combination of Goodrich and Hamilton Sundstrand. Goodrich's talented people, complementary products, high 
aftermarket content, and strong positions on new programs will add to the already strong UTC portfolio," 
Chenevert added. "While we expect the Goodrich acquisition to present headwind in 2012, we believe it will be 
solidly accretive in 2013." The closing of the Goodrich acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, 
including regulatory and Goodrich shareholder approvals. The transaction with Rolls-Royce is also subject to 
customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. 
Today's United Technologies meeting with investors and analysts was broadcast live on the Internet and the 
audio and presentation materials will be available at www.utc.com. United Technologies Corp., based in Hartford, 
Connecticut, is a diversified company that provides a broad range of high technology products and support 
services to the building systems and aerospace industries.

* Aims to reduce sales of stock to finance Goodrich deal 
* Analysts see $1.5 bln in business at play 
* "Never, ever seen this degree of urgency," analyst says 
By Scott Malone 
BOSTON, Dec 20(Reuters) - As United Technologies Corp 
gets ready to close the biggest takeover in its history, Goodrich Corp, CEO Louis Chenevert is scouring the 
diversified manufacturer's portfolio for businesses to sell. 
The world's largest maker of elevators and air conditioners has identified businesses that generate about $1.5 
billion in collective annual revenue -- about 2.5 percent of the company -- as possible sale targets, with most of 
the candidates in the company's fire and security products division, analysts said. 
The Hartford, Connecticut-based company, which also makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky 
helicopters, is likely to close at least some of the sales before it completes its $16.5 billion takeover of aerospace 
components maker Goodrich in mid-2012. The goal is to minimize the up to $4.6 billion in new shares it said it 
could issue to fund the Goodrich purchase. 
"I have never, ever seen this degree of urgency," said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co that 
follows the company. "All of the senior managers are riding with the spurs on the horse the whole time. They are 
not walking the horse." 
Chenevert, who has served as chief executive of the company since 2008, telegraphed his intentions at a 
meeting with investors in New York last week. 
"I hate equity issuance," Chenevert said. 
Analysts said they would welcome any efforts to help the company, with a $65.59 billion market value, avoid 
selling additional shares. United Tech this year also bought out its former partner Rolls-Royce Plc's stake in a 
joint venture that makes jet engines for $1.5 billion. 
"If you have an underperforming business that you can sell, wouldn't you rather sell that than sell a piece of the 
whole company?" said Daniel Holland, an analyst at Morningstar. 
PORTFOLIO REASSESSMENT 
The company is doing a "reassessment of the portfolio," Chenevert told reporters on Thursday. 
"There's UTC core, which is aerospace, which is commercial (building products) and then, looking at the portfolio, 
there's a lot of other pieces that I think will be under review," Chenevert said. 
He declined to name any specific businesses the company would consider selling, but cited the private 
security-guard operations that United Tech had acquired as it built up its fire and security equipment business -- 
most of which it has sold -- as examples of the sort of labor-intensive business he did not want to be in.

Page 5 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"If a lot of humans are involved and it's labor-intensive, then they don't want to be in the business," said analyst 
Brian Langenberg, of Langenberg & Co. "There's about $1.5 billion in business that doesn't need to be in the 
portfolio." 
Analysts said they expect most of the focus to be on the company's fire and security business. That unit made a 
series of more than 40 acquisitions from 2006 through early this year under the leadership of William Brown, who 
in October left United Tech to become CEO of Harris Corp, a maker of telecommunications equipment. That 
spate of deals includes the $1.8 billion deal for General Electric Co 's security arm that Chenevert holds up as an 
example of an idealized takeover for his company. 
"Whenever a guy who rolls everything up into a business goes out the door, there's an opportunity to re-look at 
things," said Heymann, of William Blair. 
The fire and security unit still has a handful of labor-intensive operations, including a security guard business in 
Macau and remote video and phone monitoring operations in the United Kingdom and Australia. 
Another analyst suggested that the company's Clipper Windpower unit, which United Tech bought out last year, 
could be a sale candidate. The company had taken a minority stake in the wind turbine manufacturer but wound 
up buying the Carpenteria, California-based company outright after Clipper faced a cash crunch and turned to 
United Tech for a loan. 
"The Clipper Wind acquisition, that strikes me as a piece that is not necessarily core to United Technologies, that 
they should be able to part with pretty easily and just generate cash," said Morningstar's Holland. 
A United Tech spokesman declined to elaborate on Chenevert's Thursday comments.

DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
United Technologies Corp. (UTX) predicted the addition of Goodrich Corp. (GR) and the absence of share 
buybacks next year would pressure earnings in 2012, though it expected profit would grow excluding that 
takeover, despite revenue below analysts' estimates. 
The aerospace and building controls specialist predicted earnings of $5.80 to $6 from its base business excluding 
Goodrich, which it expects to acquire in the middle of the year. United Technologies also projected sales 
between $59 billion and $60 billion, also excluding any effect from Goodrich. 
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters are forecasting $5.90 in earnings and $62.09 billion in revenue. 
However, factoring in dilution from the Goodrich takeover as well as a headwind from a lack of share 
repurchases, the company predicted earnings would be $5.30 to $5.50 a share. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Louis Chenevert said the company--which makes of Otis elevators, Pratt & 
Whitney aircraft engines and Carrier air-conditioning systems--expects next year to be transformational, as it 
operates under a new organizational structure and completes the acquisitions of Goodrich and Rolls-Royce 
Holdings PLC's (RR.LN, RYCEY) share of an engines joint venture. 
He predicted four of the company's five business units would report "solid organic sales growth" in 2012. 
"Relentless focus on cost reduction and productivity while investing in innovative technologies will position us to 
grow earnings per share 6% to 10% in 2012, excluding Goodrich, despite significant pension and foreign 
exchange headwinds," he said. 
The $16.4 billion Goodrich takeover, unveiled in September, expands United Technologies aerospace business, 
a sector with expanding sales and margins. 
In the third quarter, United Technologies earnings rose and it raised 2011 earnings guidance, even though it 
noted that demand in some markets was weakening. 
United Technologies shares closed Thursday up 36 cents at $73.53 and weren't active after hours.

By Nick Zieminski and Scott Malone 
NEW YORK, Dec 15 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp 
said on Thursday it expected to increase profits by 6 to 10 percent in 2012, despite a slowing U.S. recovery and 
what it expects to be a prolonged slump in Europe. 
In a nod to deteriorating conditions, the world's largest maker of elevators and air conditioners forecast revenue 
growth of 1.7 to 3.4 percent at its core businesses. 
The profit and revenue forecasts omitted the costs and revenue of the company's pending $16.5 billion deal for 
Goodrich Corp, its biggest-ever acquisition, which it expects to close in the middle of the year. 
The company, which also makes Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt & Whitney jet engines, is planning for several 
years of slow growth in Europe, Chief Executive Louis Chenevert told reporters after a meeting with analysts. 
"Obviously we follow the situation in Europe very closely and we will adjust proactively according to what we see 
the market's going to do," Chenevert said. "I don't expect at this point in time that we will see a recession (In 
Europe) but I expect a tough couple of years of pretty soft market." 
That stands in contrast to his peers at Honeywell International Inc who told investors earlier on 
Thursday that they do expect the European economy to slip into recession in the first half of 2012. 
The company is considering selling some smaller pieces of its diverse portfolio to avoid selling stock to help fund 
the Goodrich buy. 
"It's a reassessment of the portfolio ...…there's UTC core, which is aerospace, commercial (building products) 
and then looking at the portfolio, there's a lot of other pieces that I think will be under review and then we'll make 
the decision," Chenevert said. "I hate equity issuance." 
EPS VIEW $5.80 TO $6 
The Hartford, Connecticut-based company, which also makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky 
helicopters, forecast 2012 earnings of about $5.80 to $6 per share, excluding the Goodrich deal. 
Analysts had expected $5.90 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Page 11 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"Our EPS growth outlook for the base business is 10 percent," Chenevert said. 
Overall, the Goodrich deal will represent a 50 cent per share drag on earnings next year, reflecting deal costs 
and the company's suspension of share buybacks, and could leave net income down as much as 3 percent. 
United Tech forecast 2012 sales of about $64 billion, including acquired Goodrich revenue, or $59 billion to $60 
billion from its base business. 
The company forecast the strongest sales growth at its Hamilton Sundstrand aircraft electronics unit, which it 
expects to grow about 10 percent, and the weakest at Sikorsky helicopters, which it forecast down by 
mid-single-digit percentages. 
The forecast was roughly in line with other 2012 profit forecasts that its fellow diversified manufacturers released 
this week. General Electric Co estimated "double digit" profit growth, Honeywell International Inc estimated 
"double digit" profit growth, 
called for growth of up to 12 percent and Danaher Corp forecast 15 to 20 percent growth. 
Since United Tech announced third quarter results in mid-October, order trends and foreign exchange were about 
in line with expectations, taxes were more favorable, and the company's fire and security business was weaker 
than expected, Chenevert said. 
Foreign exchange and pension costs will likely be challenges next year, the CEO said, but predicting the value of 
the euro was "almost impossible."

2011 OCT 8 - (VerticalNews.com) -- United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX) announced it has reached 
agreement to purchase Goodrich Corporation (NYSE: GR) for $127.50 per share in cash. This equates to a total 
enterprise value of $18.4 billion, including $1.9 billion in net debt assumed. United Technologies expects to 
finance the transaction through a combination of debt and equity issuance. The equity component is expected to 
approximate 25 percent of the total. The closing is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory 
and Goodrich shareholder approvals. 
Following completion of the transaction, United Technologies is expected to have worldwide sales of 
approximately $66 billion based on projected 2011 results. The combined company's increased scale, financial 
strength and complementary products will strengthen United Technologies' position in the aerospace and defense 
industry. 
Goodrich is a global supplier of systems and services to the aerospace and defense industry. Its products 
include aircraft landing gear, aircraft wheels and brakes. Goodrich, with estimated 2011 sales of $8 billion, 
serves a global customer base with 27,000 employees worldwide. 
"Goodrich delivers on all of our acquisition criteria. It is strategic to our core, has great technology and people, 
and strengthens our position in growth markets," said United Technologies Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
Louis Chenevert. "We are very excited to bring the capabilities of two great companies together, making us more 
competitive and better able to provide value to both customers and shareholders." 
"We are extremely pleased to have an agreement with United Technologies that delivers immediate cash value to 
our shareholders at a premium that reflects the strength of our business," said Marshall Larsen, Chairman, 
President and Chief Executive Officer of Goodrich. "Our combination with United Technologies is a testament to 
our employees and will enable us to shape the future of aerospace through continued innovation, increased 
global scale and the best talent in the industry. Importantly, United Technologies has a similar culture of mutual 
trust and respect, accountability and teamwork. Goodrich's long and proud history will enter a new chapter as 
part of United Technologies." 
Goodrich is well positioned for future growth based on its increased content on leading new commercial and 
military aircraft. The company's broad position across many platforms, combined with increased air-framer 
production rates, will drive sustainable long-term aftermarket growth. United Technologies expects the transaction 
will be accretive to earnings in the second year. 
"Goodrich is a great business with a solid product portfolio and significant aftermarket sales that complement 
UTC's existing aerospace presence," Chenevert said. "This acquisition further strengthens our position in the 
growing commercial aerospace market and enhances our ability to support our customers with more integrated

United Technologies is buying Goodrich for $18.4 billion, marking one of the largest aerospace and defense 
(A&D) mergers since a wave of industry consolidation in the late 1990s. 
UTC announced the deal late Sept. 21, confirming the talks the two companies were rumored to have held since 
mid-September. The deal is for $127.50 per share of Goodrich, including $1.9 billion in debt. UTC says it plans to 
finance the deal through a combination of debt and equity, with the equity component comprising 25% of the deal. 
The combined company is expected to have sales of $66 billion. Separately, UTC was expected to report 2011 
revenues of $58 billion, while Goodrich was expected to report revenues of $8 billion. 
UTC plans to borrow about three-quarters of the purchase price. UTC CEO Louis Chenevert said he expects the 
deal, which still must receive shareholder and regulatory approval, will close in the second or third quarter of 
2012. 
“This acquisition further strengthens our position in the growing commercial aerospace market and enhances our 
ability to support customers with more integrated systems,” Chenevert says. 
While the talks were said to be ongoing, Bain & Co. global A&D practice leader Michael Goldberg told Aviation 
Week that a potential deal would make sense. “A deal would increase the number of subsystems and capabilities 
between power and propulsion and electronics structures and interiors and would give a larger supplier an 
opportunity to provide more on each airplane,” he says. 
Chenevert acknowledged that his company has been eying Goodrich for some time. He said robust growth in air 
traffic, driven by emerging markets, adds to the appeal of a combination, noting that UTC’s Hamilton Sundstrand 
and Goodrich both provide a lot of content to new aircraft platforms. 
Goodrich CEO Marshall Larsen will become chairman, president and CEO of a combined UTC Aerospace 
Systems business unit that includes Goodrich and Hamilton Sundstrand and which will be based in Charlotte, 
N.C. 
Larsen notes that 43% of Goodrich’s sales are in the aftermarket. And he adds that the 30% of Goodrich sales 
in defense and space are spread across many areas, Fighter says. 
Chenevert said he does not expect major problems with antirust regulators because there is not a large overlap 
between the companies’ product lines. He notes Goodrich will bring new products such as nacelles, landing 
gears and brakes.

Ever since a wave of mergers greatly reduced the number of prime contractors in aerospace and defense from 
1992-2003, prevailing wisdom has held that the industry's top-tier companies have grown large enough. Now one 
of those giants, United Technologies Corp., is challenging that assumption by forging an $18.4 billion agreement 
to acquire Goodrich Corp. 
The blockbuster deal, unveiled Sept. 21, would create a commercial aerospace powerhouse with a broad portfolio 
of products, from United Technologies Corp.'s (UTC) Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines and Hamilton Sundstrand 
aircraft control systems to Goodrich's landing gear, nacelles and electric braking systems. Both companies are 
already leading suppliers for the Boeing 787, and their merger would put UTC in a strong position to capitalize on 
future generations of commercial jets. “We have a brand new set of capabilities,” proclaims UTC Chairman/CEO 
Louis Chenevert. 
If approved by shareholders and antitrust regulators, the consolidation would be by far the biggest A&D merger 
since the creation of EADS in 2000 and Honeywell International's $16.6-billion purchase of AlliedSignal the year 
before that. “It will be a once-in-a-lifetime deal,” says Anita Antenucci, senior managing director at investment 
bank Houlihan Lokey. 
Then there are the broader implications. UTC's pursuit of Goodrich could mark the opening salvo in yet another 
wave of sizable A&D mergers as other large contractors move to follow suit and more mid-sized companies feel 
forced to merge or sell to remain competitive. The top 15 A&D contractors are sitting on more than $50 billion in 
cash and looking for new avenues of growth to offset declining military budgets in the U.S. and Europe. More than 
60% of 100 senior A&D executives surveyed earlier this year by KPMG say they plan to be involved in M&A 
during the next two years, either as a buyer or a seller. 
With Boeing and Airbus holding a collective order backlog of more than 7,500 jets that will take years to fill, it is 
little wonder that well-positioned suppliers are attractive targets as large contractors and multi-industry 
conglomerates such as UTC look for new business amid sputtering economies in the U.S. and Europe. Goodrich 
was able to get UTC to offer a premium of nearly 50% above its stock price before news of the talks began to 
leak. “Defense companies are now looking well beyond adjacencies to commercial aerospace,” says Antenucci. 
“And those that are already in are getting in further.” 
But the proposed UTC-Goodrich combination also revives the question of how much more A&D consolidation the 
U.S. and European Union are willing to tolerate, given their deep distaste for sole-source suppliers. In 2001, a 
proposed $42 billion merger of General Electric and Honeywell won approval from U.S. antitrust authorities but 
was later scuttled by the EU on the grounds that it would reduce competition in commercial aerospace and lead to 
higher prices for aircraft buyers. 
While not commenting directly on the UTC-Goodrich arrangement, Jon Kutler, chairman and CEO of A&D 
investment firm Admiralty Partners, is skeptical that the Pentagon and antitrust regulators will allow another large 
wave of megamergers. “In both commercial aerospace and defense markets, the government permitted a great 
deal of consolidation to happen in the 1990s that they would likely have not allowed if they anticipated the growth 
of the last decade,” he says. “You now have prime contractors and a number of first-tier subcontractors 
dominating their markets to the point where further consolidation would dramatically impact competition.” Kutler 
still sees plenty of coalescing in the future, but believes it will occur at the second and third tiers of the supply 
chain.

Michael Goldberg, the leader of Bain & Co.'s global A&D practice, believes there is room for at least a few M&A 
hook-ups in the $3-8 billion range. “There are a number of companies in that range that have a lot of cash on 
hand and may be in a 'buy or be bought' mode,” he says. “But we're talking about a handful, not dozens.” 
Chenevert's position is that a UTC-Goodrich merger would be good for the two companies' major customers by, 
among other things, enhancing UTC's ability to offer more integrated systems. But Tom Williams, Airbus's 
executive vice president for programs, recently expressed reservations about further consolidation among top-tier 
suppliers. He believes contraction at that level “has almost gone too far.” 
As for regulatory hurdles, Chenevert expresses confidence that the deal will win antitrust approvals because so 
many of the capabilities that Goodrich brings to the table are new to his company. That sentiment is shared by 
Jefferies & Co. analyst Howard Rubel. “We do not see any material overlap that should derail the transaction,” he 
says. Chenevert expects the merger to close in the second or third quarter of 2012. 
The deal struck with Goodrich marks a defining moment in Chenevert's three-year rein as CEO. Though Pratt & 
Whitney has invested more than $1 billion in the next-generation geared turbofan (GTF) engine, UTC has not 
made a big-ticket purchase in aerospace since its $4.2 billion acquisition of Sundstrand in 1999. 
With a strong position on leading commercial aircraft and 43% of its revenues generated in the higher-margin 
aftermarket, Goodrich has been a target of UTC for some time. Bernstein Research analyst Douglas S. Harned 
says that UTC also has looked in recent years at companies such as Rockwell Collins and Honeywell. He 
cautions, however, that UTC's proven formula of increasing the value of its acquisitions by making them operate 
more efficiently might be more difficult to achieve with Goodrich, a company that has improved its operational 
performance during the past five years. 
The plans call for Goodrich and Hamilton Sundstrand to be merged into a combined UTC Aerospace Systems 
unit. That unit will be run by Goodrich CEO Marshall Larsen and based out of Goodrich's headquarters in 
Charlotte, N.C. 
Goodrich also has a defense and space business that accounts for about 30% of its projected $8 billion in sales 
this year. Larsen emphasizes that the defense unit is spread across many areas—electro-optical surveillance, 
helicopters, the Joint Strike Fighter—and therefore is not as vulnerable to defense budget reductions. In fact, 
Goodrich's defense sales saw organic growth of 8% in the first half of 2011. 
The addition of Goodrich would raise UTC's annual sales to about $66 billion, with just under half of that coming 
from A&D and the rest from industrial businesses such as Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners.

It took three years, but Louis Chenevert has made United Technologies Corp. his company. With an $18.4 billion 
deal to acquire Goodrich Corp., the chairman and CEO of the aerospace-industrial conglomerate is placing a 
costly bet on the future of the commercial aircraft sector. He is also stepping out from under the big shadow cast 
by his legendary predecessor, George David. 
David ran UTC from 1994 to 2008, transforming a laggard company into an industry model and laying the 
groundwork for long-term prosperity by greatly expanding UTC’s global footprint. Along the way, he generated 
immense returns for shareholders. Chenevert appeared to feel the challenge of filling those shoes during his early 
days as CEO. Relaxed and talkative during his previous job as president of UTC’s Pratt & Whitney unit, the 
imposing French Canadian became cautious and scripted. Reporters who interviewed him sometimes left with 
little new to write about, save for his pet project, Pratt’s geared-turbofan engine. 
But in pursuing the Goodrich deal, Chenevert demonstrated he has the boldness and confidence to lead UTC on 
a new course. The acquisition, which is expected to close next year, will reignite UTC’s growth in the commercial 
aviation market, balancing out the company’s industrial businesses. By marrying its Hamilton Sundstrand unit with 
Goodrich, UTC will increase its presence on important platforms such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 while 
expanding its heft in a market that will likely grow increasingly crowded with new competitors from emerging 
markets. 
Equally striking is that UTC is making its biggest acquisition ever — and its first major aerospace deal since 1999 
— at a time when multi-industry conglomerates are coming under intense pressure from activist shareholders to 
unlock value by splitting up. Tyco International Ltd. announced plans last week to break into three companies, 
following in the footsteps of ITT Industries Inc. and The McGraw-Hill Companies, the parent of Aviation Week. In 
the defense industry, companies such as Northrop Grumman and L-3 Communications have given in to 
shareholder demands to spin off underperforming assets. 
Buying Goodrich is just the first step for UTC, however. For the deal to pay off, the two companies will have to 
find a way to successfully join their cultures. It took many of the big mergers of the 1990s 5-10 years to 
accomplish that. “The blending of our two cultures is extremely important,” acknowledges Goodrich CEO 
Marshall Larsen, who is slated to run a new UTC unit that combines Goodrich and Hamilton Sundstrand. But, he 
adds, “we’ve come to believe that our cultures are not that different.” Chenevert is putting his chips on the table, 
and if the merger succeeds, UTC shareholders will reap benefits for years to come. Nobody can or should take 
David’s accomplishments from him. But it’s time for another legacy to be created.

U.S. 
The Federal Reserve launched a more aggressive package of measures than expected as the global economy 
drew closer to another recession. Fresh data pointed to a decline in manufacturing activity in both China, a critical 
engine of the recovery, and Europe, and rival parties in Europe and the U.S. remain divided on how to respond. 
The Fed's latest move was to shift its $2.65 trillion securities portfolio further than previously planned toward 
long-term U.S. Treasury bonds—the Twist, as it's called—and, in a surprise move, toward mortgage debt. The 
aim is to lower interest rates, boosting investment and spending and jump-starting the housing sector. Three of 10 
voting Fed officials were opposed. 
The weakened U.S. economy will depress housing prices for years, restraining consumer spending, pushing 
more homeowners into foreclosure and clouding prospects for a sustained recovery, economists, builders and 
mortgage analysts predict. Home prices are expected to drop 2.5% this year and rise just 1.1% annually through 
2015, according to a survey released Wednesday. One in five Americans with a mortgage now owes more than 
his or her home's value, and $7 trillion of homeowners' equity has been lost in the bust. The fallout is broad. 
ShopperTrak said in a new forecast that national retail sales would rise by just 3% in November and December 
from a year earlier. Some parts of the country will do better than others: census data out this week showed that 
many of the nation's most educated people continue to cluster in a handful of dominant metropolitan areas such 
as Boston, New York and Silicon Valley, redoubling those regions' advantages. "In a knowledge economy, 
success breeds success," said a Brookings fellow of the findings. 
The "Don't ask, don't tell" ban on gays serving openly in the military was lifted, the end of an 18-year policy under 
which more than 14,000 service members were discharged. "I think it will be pretty unremarkable across the 
military," said Gen. Carter Ham, who helped lead a study of the likely impact, "and I think that is the way it should 
be." 
The U.S. accused leaders of the Full Tilt Poker website of defrauding thousands of online poker players out of 
more than $300 million in a "global Ponzi scheme," part of a broader crackdown on the industry. Before the 
crackdown, one research firm estimated there were 1.7 million active poker player accounts in the U.S. from 
players wagering about $14 billion a year online. And on the high-tech edge of law enforcement, the role of the 
"stingray" cellphone-tracking device in nabbing a hotly pursued man the FBI calls "the Hacker" is driving a 
constitutional debate about whether the Fourth Amendment—which prohibits unreasonable searches and 
seizures but pre-dates the digital age—is keeping pace with the times. The stingray mimics a cellphone tower. 
Aboriginal Australians may be directly descended from the earliest of several human groups that left Africa and 
colonized the world, new genetic evidence suggests, in a challenge to a widely held model that argues for a 
single dispersal from Africa. 
Politics 
Obama set forth a new plan to cut the federal budget deficit by $3.6 trillion over 10 years, folding in his $447 
billion jobs bill and including $1.5 trillion in tax increases. Revving up the campaign engines, he threatened to veto 
any bill that cuts Medicare benefits without raising taxes on corporations or the wealthy. Republican leaders have 
ruled out tax increases. To charges of class warfare over the plan's "Buffett rule," aimed at preventing millionaires 
from paying lower taxes than middle-class Americans, the president said, "This is not class warfare. It's math." It 
was a base-energizer, but the Buffetts of the world aside, most people with taxable income of $1 million or more 
already are taxed at a much higher rate than middle-class earners.

Congress needs to pass a funding bill before the fiscal year ends Sept. 30, but Democrats want to provide a lot 
more for disaster relief than Republicans. They're testing the limits of the antideficit push and hoping to show that 
government can play a crucial role in some areas; Boehner, for his part, is having more trouble mustering votes. 
Obama is set to replace key planks of George W. Bush's signature No Child Left Behind law, allowing many 
schools to escape looming punishment if their states adopt a new set of standards. 
Front-runners Perry and Romney clashed over Social Security and health care in a GOP presidential debate. 
World 
Economic output in the euro zone contracted for the first time in more than two years. European banks face about 
$411 billion in potential losses from the euro-zone debt crisis, the IMF said, as it urged them to raise capital to 
protect the global economy. Greece, scrambling to meet fresh austerity demands from its international creditors in 
exchange for aid, is to cut pensions, tax low-income earners and put some 30,000 government workers on 60% 
of their salary for a year. 
The U.N. was a hothouse as Palestinian leaders pressed ahead with a bid for full membership. Obama, facing 
attacks on his foreign policy from leading Republican presidential candidates, implored the U.N. to hold off on a 
vote, saying Israel and the Palestinians must work out a peace deal on their own. Ahmadinejad told the General 
Assembly that Tehran wouldn't recognize Israel's right to exist, regardless of any U.N. move to grant statehood to 
the Palestinian people, even as Iran released on bail two American hikers who had been held for two years. With 
a series of close encounters between American and Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf, U.S. officials are 
considering a direct military hot line with the Islamic republic. The international community pledged to help rebuild 
Libya, as the country's new government took its place on the world stage. Libya started pumping oil again for the 
first time since the toppling of Gadhafi, but poor security and damage to the country's network of ports and oil 
terminals could delay the large-scale resumption of exports to Western markets. 
U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Mullen said support for terrorism was part of the Pakistani government's strategy, in a 
rare public condemnation in the wake of last week's insurgent attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Afghanistan's 
intelligence agency accused the Taliban's top leadership in Pakistan of orchestrating the assassination of 
Burhanuddin Rabbani, Afghanistan's most prominent peace negotiator and a former president. Rabbani was killed 
at his well-protected Kabul home by a purported Taliban envoy. The slaying and the charges could make it 
increasingly difficult for Washington to pursue negotiations with the insurgent group. In eastern Africa, the 
U.S.—keen to follow up on its killing of bin Laden with operations to destroy his terrorist organization—is 
deploying a new force of armed drones, escalating its campaign to strike at militant targets of all kinds and 
expand intelligence on extremists. And continued violence in Yemen raised the prospect that the impoverished 
country could be nearing factional war. 
A U.S. decision to sell Taiwan upgrades of old fighter jets, rather than new planes, reflected a fresh reality in the 
region. All sides are calculating that the island is increasingly indefensible against an attack by China and are 
banking on closer economic ties to help resolve historic tensions. 
Business 
Hewlett-Packard's board ousted CEO Apotheker and named former eBay chief Whitman to succeed him. Just last 
month, with the board's blessing, Apotheker announced a plan to revamp H-P by splitting off or selling its PC 
business and spending $10.3 billion to acquire British software company Autonomy, sending the company's 
shares plunging. "I think the strategy is right," said Whitman, 55. "I will obviously step back and take a hard look at 
this." Apotheker's brief but turbulent tenure, in which Hewlett-Packard's market value was nearly sliced in half, is 
the latest setback for a company buffeted by a decade of board acrimony, abrupt CEO departures and strategic 
drift. 
Groupon said it was cutting its reported revenue in half, and its No. 2 executive left the company. Regulators have 
been scrutinizing Groupon's accounting since it filed for an IPO that could value the daily-deals pioneer at $20 
billion. Elsewhere in tech, Schmidt acquitted himself pretty well as senators probed whether Google has abused 
its growing dominance of the Web. "Many of us in Silicon Valley have absorbed the lessons of that era," he said, 
alluding to the antitrust case against Microsoft, but saying of the lawmakers' concerns, "We get it." Netflix chief 
Hastings thinks he's learned some lessons himself, and said the separation of his DVD-by-mail business from his 
Internet movie-streaming service was essential, despite many angry customers. 
A proposed four-year labor agreement between General Motors and the United Auto Workers points to a future in 
which workers trade the guarantee of gold-plated wages and benefits for job security and pay increases tied to

the company's health. The agreement would give workers richer profit-sharing checks and restore thousands of 
union jobs. In exchange, workers would forgo cost-of-living increases, which have long been a way of life in 
Detroit. Higher-wage workers would get inducements to leave, paving the way for lower-paid hires, while 
lower-wage workers would get a bump. The union is now negotiating contracts with Ford Motor and Chrysler 
Group. 
United Technologies agreed to buy aircraft-components maker Goodrich for $16.4 billion, its biggest acquisition 
ever and a signature deal for Chief Executive Louis Chenevert. The purchase strengthens UT's commercial 
aviation business at a time when the industry's order books are full and brings Chenevert a deal big enough to 
add measurably to a company that expects to reap $58 billion in revenue this year. It sets United Technologies 
apart from conglomerates like Tyco International, which announced plans this week to break into three. On the 
financial front, solid borrowers are getting ready access to M&A financing, as shown by the flood of loan offers to 
UT for the Goodrich deal. 
News Corp.'s U.K. newspaper unit plans to pay about $4.7 million in connection with allegations that its News of 
the World tabloid hacked unto the cellphone voice mail of murdered teenager Milly Dowler in 2002, according to 
people familiar with the matter. It would be by far the company's largest payout tied to phone-hacking allegations. 
Markets 
Global investors dumped everything from stocks to corporate bonds to foreign currencies and fled to the relative 
safety of U.S. Treasurys, fearing a Greek debt default and another recession, even after leaders from the G-20 
vowed a "strong and coordinate response" to preserve the stability of financial markets. The Dow industrials 
dropped 6.41%, their worst week since October 2008, a slide accelerated by a warning from FedEx on the pace 
of global trade. Currency traders rushed for safe havens, with the dollar and the yen emerging as islands of 
strength. The wave of selling even swamped gold and silver on Friday, as investors rushed to cash out of 
profitable investments to make up for losses elsewhere. 
Prosecutors expanded the case against Kweku Adoboli, the accused UBS rogue trader, to include allegations that 
his illegal activity dated back to 2008. The total amount of losses involved also grew, to $2.3 billion. Meanwhile, 
the UBS board met in Singapore to discuss the bank's internal investigation as speculation swirled about the fate 
of the company's chief executive and the head of its investment-banking division. UBS wasn't the only bank 
worried about possible rogue trading. British regulators are reportedly looking at multiple cases of improper or 
unauthorized trading at banks there, and top executives are said to be scrambling to assess whether they are 
similarly vulnerable. 
A new draft proposal of the so-called Volcker rule dilutes the provision's original ban on proprietary trading. By 
giving banks wide latitude to "hedge" positions, the new proposal takes much of the bite out of the original rule, 
which banks have lobbied against heavily. 
Citigroup mailed out an estimated 346 million credit card offers in the third quarter, more than one for every man, 
woman and child in the U.S. The push is expected to make Citi the largest mailer of credit card offers in the 
country, and shows how the bank is trying to regain ground lost to rivals during the 2008 financial crisis. 
Wall Street is taking a bruising. The biggest investment banks are seeing sharply lower revenue, which could 
result in job cuts and lower bonuses, further undermining a fragile economy. How bad is it? Goldman Sachs 
Group is at risk of posting only its second quarterly loss in its dozen years as a public company. 
Securities regulators have sent subpoenas to hedge funds, specialized trading shops and other firms as they 
probe possible insider trading that may have taken place before the U.S. government's long-term credit rating was 
cut last month, people familiar with the matter said. 
The SEC charged a Goldman Sachs employee with tipping off his father about market-moving trades the Wall 
Street firm was about to make, allowing the two to earn $57,000 in illicit profits. It was the first insider-trading case 
related to the $1 trillion market in exchange-traded funds, and comes as regulators are reviewing their controls on 
the increasingly popular funds. 
By the Numbers

Number of countries with satellites currently in orbit, double what it was 20 years ago. NASA on Friday warned 
there was still a small chance that remnants of a plummeting research satellite could end up in parts of the U.S.

Space junk is a big problem, though the risks posed by orbiting debris to satellites and astronauts are greater

20th 
Anniversary of the Jim Henson Boyhood Exhibit in Leland, Miss., which on Saturday celebrates the renaming of 
the Broad Street Bridge over Deer Creek as the Rainbow Connection, in honor of the song Kermit the Frog

Number of the Week: 11.09% 
Through much of the 1990s and 2000s, Americans let their spending grow faster than their paychecks were 
growing, borrowing to fund more and more of their purchases. One consequence: the amount they had to spend 
each month paying down mortgages, credit cards and other debts ended up eating into their income as well. 
By the third quarter of 2007, 13.96% of after-tax income was going toward debt payments, according to data from 
the Federal Reserve, up from 11.06% at the end of 1994. 
Then came the recession, and the debt service ratio fell sharply. That's partly due to a shift toward frugality, but it 
is also because many have been walking away from their mortgages and other debts. 
So now we have a bigger chunk of our pay to spend on other things. Considering how much our net worth has 
fallen since 2007, though, we may prefer to save it.

United Technologies Corp, a diversified company of air conditioning, aerospace systems, on September 
22, 2011, said it has successfully acquired aerospace devices manufacturing company Goodrich 
Corporation, for USD 18.4 billion. 
“The company has reached agreement to purchase Goodrich Corporation for $127.50 per share in cash. 
This equates to a total enterprise value of $18.4 billion, including $1.9 billion in net debt assumed,” 
United Technologies said in a press statement. 
The company plans to fund the acquisition by issuing debt and equity, with the equity accounting about 
25 per cent of the total amount, the statement added. 
United Technologies said it expects worldwide sales of about USD 66 billion, on projected 2011 results, 
after the completion of this transaction. It also believes that the combined company’s increased scale, 
financial strength and complementary products will strengthen United Technologies’ position in the 
aerospace and defense industry. 
Commenting on the acquisition, United Technologies Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Louis 
Chênevert said, “Goodrich delivers on all of our acquisition criteria. It is strategic to our core, has great 
technology and people, and strengthens our position in growth markets. We are very excited to bring 
the capabilities of two great companies together, making us more competitive and better able to 
provide value to both customers and shareholders.” 
The company had announced its intention to acquire Goodrich on September 19, 2011. 
Goodrich seemed equally excited about the acquisition of the company by United Technologies. 
Goodrich, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Marshall Larsen said, “We are extremely 
pleased to have an agreement with United Technologies that delivers immediate cash value to our 
shareholders at a premium that reflects the strength of our business.” 
For the entire process, J.P. Morgan and Goldman, Sachs & Co. will be the financial advisors and 
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is serving as a legal advisor to United Technologies.

NEW YORK 
UNITED Technologies Corp (UTC) has agreed to buy Goodrich Corp for US$16.5 billion (S$21.2 billion), adding 
a maker of aircraft landing gear and jet-turbine casings to take advantage of a record surge in commercial-plane 
orders. 
The purchase has an enterprise value of US$18.4 billion, including US$1.9 billion in net debt, the companies said 
in a statement yesterday. 
Goodrich stockholders will get US$127.50 a share, and Hartford, Connecticut-based UTC will finance the deal 
through a combination of new debt and equity, with the equity making up about 25 per cent of the total. 
UTC, whose aviation brands include Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt & Whitney engines, is making its first big 
purchase since buying Sundstrand Corp in 1999 for US$4 billion. The dealis the first large aerospace acquisition 
for chief executive Louis Chenevert, 54, who got the job in 2008. 
Goodrich CEO Marshall Larsen, 63, will become chairman and CEO of a combined UTC Aerospace Systems 
business unit, based in Goodrich’s hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Goodrich reported sales of US$6.97 billion last year, compared with US$54.3 billion for UTC. Mr Chenevert’s 
three aerospace businesses – Pratt, Sikorsky and Hamilton Sundstrand – made up US$22.23 billion of that total. 
Adding commercial aerospace revenue would be a boost for UTC after Pratt’s geared turbofan engine failed to 
win placement on Boeing’s upgraded 737, the world’s most widely flown jetliner. 
The engine, which Mr Chenevert spent more than US$1 billion and a decade developing, is a choice on Airbus’ 
upgraded A320neo family, a 737 rival. 
Goodrich could increase per- share profit at UTC by as much as 10 per cent next year and 12 per cent in 2013, 
Mr Howard Rubel, a Jefferies & Co analyst in New York, said in a note to clients on Monday. 
“The company, in our view, deserves a premium for the effort it has expended on improving its market position,” 
wrote Mr Rubel, who recommends buying Goodrich. 
“There are very few major new aircraft platforms for the next several years; the best way to be on what is new is 
to go with Goodrich.” 
Goodrich is the world’s biggest manufacturer of landing gear, and its products include nacelles, the casings that 
house jet engines, and de-icing systems used on planes. 
At the same time, new aircraft programmes – such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A320neo, which 
Goodrich supplies – are set to ramp up production. 
Goodrich could also provide a buffer for UTC as some of its units face headwinds because of a declining 
defence-spending outlook.

UTC-Goodrich Deal Creates New Division In Charlotte, N.C. 
UTC-Goodrich Deal Creates New Division In Charlotte, N.C.

Distributed by McClatchy - Tribune Information Services. 
Sept. 23--The company that designed the astronaut space suit in the 1960s is buying the company that invented 
the airplaine pilot pressurized suit in the 1930s. 
United Technologies Corp's $18.4 billion deal to acquire aerospace competitor Goodrich Corp. will certainly 
reshape UTC's Hamilton Sundstrand division -- long the steward of the space suit -- adding wheels, landing gear 
and brakes to the interior and electronic systems already designed and manufactured by the Windsor 
Locks-based division. 
But the deal, announced Wednesday night, also would fold Hamilton Sundstrand into a much larger division -- 
UTC Aerospace Systems -- that includes three Goodrich businesses: electronic systems, landing systems and 
interior systems. The new division would be based in Charlotte, N.C., which now serves as Goodrich's 
headquarters, and be headed by Goodrich's CEO. 
It remained unclear Thursday what the changes might mean for employment at Hamilton Sundstrand's 
headquarters and plant in Windsor Locks, where there are now about 4,000 workers. A UTC spokesman declined 
to elaborate. 
UTC and Goodrich executives told Wall Street analysts in a conference call Thursday that the good fit between 
the products offered by Hamilton Sundstrand and Goodrich made the acquisition a good one for UTC, one that 
will position the company to better be able to take advantage of the expected upswing in commercial aircraft 
orders. 
But the executives also made it clear that a key attraction to the deal was the opportunity to cut costs when 
combining the two organizations. 
UTC Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said UTC expects to save $400 million in expenses over a period of 
years as it integrates the two companies, including consolidation of plants and other facility and cuts in the 
combined employment base, especially in administrative and back office operations. Hayes did not outline any 
specifics. 
Industry experts said it is likely Windsor Locks will remain a beachhead for UTC, just as Rockford, Ill., did after 
UTC purchased Sundstrand Corp. in 1999. 
"There is very little probability that employment in Windsor Locks would drop vis-...-vis moving to other locations 
as a result of the acquisition," Mark Bobbi, an aerospace consultant, said. 
If anything, Bobbi said, the deal could consolidate more jobs in Windsor Locks from Goodrich plants in West 
Hartford and Cheshire. The West Hartford plant builds components for engines under 10,000 horsepower, and 
Cheshire makes aerospace measuring instruments would be a good fit, he said. Together, the two facilities 
employ about 1,100. 
A third plant in Danbury, which makes the mirrors for the Hubble telescope, is less likely to be consolidated 
because it develops sensitive surveillance equipment and technology, some of it classified, Bobbi said. The plant 
employs 590. 
The deal would be the biggest ever for Hartford-based UTC, and could more than double the company's sales of 
flight systems and other equipment for jetliners. The acquisition turns on UTC being able to offer more products 
as part of packages when they bid on jobs; a stronger service and repair business for narrow body jets; and 
Goodrich's prospects for growing its defense business despite looming cuts to the U.S. defense budget.

Page 29 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
UTC offered $127.50 per share in cash for Goodrich stock, for a total of $16.5 billion -- a premium of 47 percent 
over Goodrich's market value on Sept. 15, the day before the merger talks were first reported. Not including the 
Goodrich deal, UTC has paid a premium of 18 percent in about 30 deals since 2001 for which terms were 
disclosed, according to Bloomberg News, which compiled the data based on 20-day averages. 
UTC will also assume $1.9 billion in Goodrich debt, bringing the total deal to $18.4 billion. 
Analysts said Thursday some investors were taken by surprise at the premium paid for Goodrich -- and 
disappointed that the UTC will be issuing stock rather than using cash on hand. 
United Technologies "is paying a bit more than expected," said Matt Collins, an analyst at Edward Jones wrote in 
a note to investors Thursday. "Assuming Boeing and Airbus ramp up production as expected over the next 
several years this should turn out to be a good deal for [UTC.]" 
On Thursday's conference call, Hayes said UTC will make the deal work and add to earnings in the second year. 
The deal is expected to close in mid-2012. 
"We know how to integrate transactions," Hayes said. "We have a dedicated team in place, we'll be looking for 
these synergies every day." 
Nicholas P. Heymann, a analyst at William Blair & Co. in New York, said the premium was designed to prevent 
other companies from swooping in at the last minute, as was the case with UTC attempted takeover of Honeywell 
in 2000. 
"The price was very fair and pre-empted other acquirers from considering a higher bid," Heymann said. 
On a day when the market was down sharply, UTC shares fell $6.56, or nearly 9 percent, to close at $68.31 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. Goodrich shares soared 10 percent, or $11.11, to close at $120.60. 
Louis Chenevert, the UTC chairman and CEO, said Thursday the Goodrich acquisition is strategic to UTC's 
core business and strengthens the company's position in growth markets. 
"It's smack in the middle of our core competency," Chenevert said on the conference call. 
Chenevert has said that he would like to see each of UTC's divisions have $10 billion or more in annual sales. 
With $5.6 billion in annual sales, Hamilton Sundstrand lagged behind each of the other divisions, including the 
newest, Fire & Security. In recent years, the high-profile acquisitions at UTC have aimed at growing Fire & 
Security. 
Goodrich expects to have $8 billion in sales this year, employing 27,000 worldwide. UTC's sales could reach $58 
billion this year and the company has more than 200,000 employees.

Goldman Jockeyed for a Top Goodrich Billing

Goldman Jockeyed for a Top Goodrich Billing

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lobbied to be given similar investment-bank billing with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. in 
the news release announcing United Technologies Corp.'s $16.4 billion acquisition of Goodrich Corp., even 
though J.P. Morgan was the main adviser, people familiar with the matter said. 
Goldman's efforts bore fruit: Its billing in the final news release improved from a prior draft. But the firm still ended 
up cited behind rival J.P. Morgan, the lead adviser on the deal. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs declined to 
comment. 
The push show the lengths to which banks will go to maintain their standing in the eyes of competitors, clients 
and future clients. 
In this situation, there was no doubt about whether Goldman would get coveted credit in the "league tables," in 
which outside firms rank banks in their merger and acquisition work. It would. The issue was placement on the 
news release. 
Goldman is traditionally the No.1 player in advising companies and investment firms on M&A deals, but its 
ranking has been under pressure this year. J.P. Morgan held the top spot in global M&A advisory rankings from 
January until mid-May, when Goldman jumped back to its traditional top spot, according to Dealogic. 
In the United Technologies deal, announced Wednesday, Goldman Sachs was involved early on. When United 
Technologies chief executive Louis Chênevert first called Goodrich chief Marshall Larsen last September, the 
industrial giant was working with two investment banks — J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs. Those talks 
continued through November but stalled, according to people familiar with the matter 
Talks began anew after Mr. Chênevert appointed Bill Brown to head corporate strategy in March and seek out 
acquisitions, at which point Mr. Brown worked solely with J.P. Morgan, although Goldman maintained its 
relationship with the company, the people said. In recent weeks, Goldman reached back out to United 
Technologies and resumed work on the deal, the people added. The fees United Technologies is paying 
Goldman are less than those to J.P. Morgan, some of the people said. 
An early draft of the news release to announce the deal said J.P. Morgan was the lead adviser to United 
Technologies. In a separate sentence, it said Goldman Sachs also provided financial advice, the people said. 
Goldman expressed its unhappiness to United Technologies and asked that the line about J.P. Morgan being the 
lead adviser be eliminated, the people added. Changes were made to include Goldman at the same level as J.P. 
Morgan. However Goldman was listed second, rather than in alphabetical order, as is sometimes the case in 
listing advisers. 
The final news release said, "J.P. Morgan and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are acting as financial advisors to United 
Technologies. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is serving as legal advisor to United Technologies. Credit Suisse 
Securities (USA) LLC and Citi are acting as financial advisors and Jones Day is acting as legal advisor to 
Goodrich." 
A J.P. Morgan spokeswoman declined to comment. A United Technologies spokesman declined to comment. 
Last year, Goldman Sachs wasn't initially listed as an adviser to Bucyrus International Inc. when Caterpillar Inc. 
announced plans to buy it for $7.6 billion. On the news release from November 2010, Deutsche Bank AG and 
UBS AG were listed as financial advisers for Bucyrus. Goldman Sachs later got credit as one of the financial 
advisers on the deal.

United Technologies Corp. on Thursday defended its $16.4 billion deal to buy Goodrich Corp., saying the 
acquisition would add to its profits in the second year. However, investors sold off the company's shares amid a 
broader market slump. 
Late Wednesday, United Technologies agreed to buy the aircraft-components maker in the company's 
biggest-ever acquisition and a signature deal for Chief Executive Louis Chenevert. In trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange Thursday afternoon, shares of United Technologies were down $6.22, or 8.3%, to $68.65. 
The conglomerate is paying a 47% premium to Goodrich's share price before news leaked of the deal, and it 
plans to sell $4.2 billion of stock while suspending share buybacks through next year to defend its credit rating. 
United Technologies will also assume $1.9 billion in Goodrich net debt. 
The acquisition will strengthen United Technologies' exposure to the commercial-aviation business at a time when 
the industry's order books are full, and it fulfills Mr. Chenevert's desire to find a deal big enough to add 
measurably to a company that expects $58 billion in revenue this year. 
It also sets United Technologies apart from other conglomerates like Tyco International Ltd., which announced 
plans this week to break into three companies. Tyco is betting the parts will be worth more than the whole, but 
United Technologies is moving in the opposite direction, believing it will win more business by offering a fuller 
menu of products to aircraft makers. 
"We are on the eve of a substantial ramp-up" for the commercial-aviation industry, Mr. Chenevert said in an 
interview. "With the addition of Goodrich we really strengthened our aerospace position." 
United Technologies is paying $127.50 a share for Goodrich -- up 47% from where Goodrich shares closed last 
Thursday, before news of the deal leaked out, and 16% above Wednesday's close of $109.49. 
The company expects it may need to make some minor divestitures to get antitrust approval. 
United Technologies already has three aerospace businesses -- Pratt & Whitney engines, Hamilton Sundstrand 
aircraft-control systems and Sikorsky helicopters -- but there is little overlap with Goodrich's leading products, 
which include landing gear and engine housings. 
Goodrich will be combined with Hamilton Sundstrand in a new unit that will be based in Goodrich's hometown of 
Charlotte, N.C., and run by Goodrich CEO Marshall Larsen. After the deal, nearly half of United Technologies' 
revenue will come from aerospace. 
The deal will allow the company to pitch itself as a supplier of systems throughout the plane, making it a tougher 
competitor to rivals like Honeywell International Inc. and French aerospace supplier Safran SA. 
It will also broaden United Technologies' exposure to commercial aviation as tight government budgets curtail 
defense spending.

United Technologies Corp. agreed to buy aircraft-components maker Goodrich Corp. for $16.4 billion in cash, the 
company's biggest-ever acquisition and a signature deal for Chief Executive Louis Chenevert. 
The acquisition will strengthen United Technologies' exposure to the commercial aviation business at a time when 
the industry's order books are full, and it fulfills Mr. Chenevert's desire to find a deal big enough to add 
measurably to a company that expects $58 billion in revenue this year. 
It also sets United Technologies apart from other conglomerates like Tyco International Ltd., which announced 
plans this week to break into three companies. Tyco is betting the parts will be worth more than the whole, but 
United Technologies is moving in the opposite direction, believing it will win more business by offering a fuller 
menu of products to aircraft makers. 
"We are on the eve of a substantial ramp-up" for the commercial aviation industry, Mr. Chenevert said in an 
interview. "With the addition of Goodrich we really strengthened our aerospace position." 
United Technologies is paying $127.50 a share for Goodrich, up 47% from where Goodrich shares closed last 
Thursday, before news of the deal leaked out, and 16% above Wednesday's closing price of $109.49, off 2.1% on 
the day. United Technologies' shares fell 1.5% to $74.87. 
The company anticipates it may need to make some minor divestitures to get approval from antitrust authorities. 
United Technologies already has three aerospace businesses--Pratt & Whitney engines, Hamilton Sundstrand 
aircraft-control systems and Sikorsky helicopters--but there is little overlap with Goodrich's leading products, 
which include landing gear and engine housings. 
Goodrich will be combined with Hamilton Sundstrand in a new unit that will be based in Goodrich's hometown of 
Charlotte, N.C., and run by Goodrich CEO Marshall Larsen. After the deal, nearly half of United Technologies' 
revenue will come from aerospace. 
United Technologies' aerospace businesses haven't been growing as fast as its three commercial building units, 
which sell Carrier air conditioners, Otis elevators and fire and security systems. The company invested $1 billion 
to develop a new jet engine--the geared turbofan--in an attempt to get back into the single-aisle-jet business, but 
is off to a slow start after being frozen out of Boeing Co.'s plan to refresh its 737 jetliner. 
The deal will allow the company to pitch itself as a supplier of systems throughout the plane, making it a tougher 
competitor to rivals like Honeywell International Inc. and French aerospace supplier Safran SA. It will also 
broaden United Technologies' exposure to commercial aviation as tight government budgets curtail defense 
spending. About a fifth of United Technologies' sales are to the U.S. government. 
The deal "makes them an even more important player," said George Odden, a managing director in aerospace 
defense and government at investment bank Houlihan Lokey. 
A towering man with a broad smile and hint of a French accent, Mr. Chenevert, 54, took the reins at the Hartford, 
Conn.-based company three years ago. He succeeded George David, who was celebrated by investors for 
delivering consistent growth.

Earlier this year, Mr. Chenevert decided the company needed a more aggressive merger-and-acquisition 
strategy. He had his first conversation with Goodrich's Mr. Larsen last September, and the two men had been 
talking every two months. 
United Technologies will focus on integrating the deal, but won't shy away from smaller transactions over the next 
few years, Mr. Chenevert said. 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is lead adviser to United Technologies and is heading up a $15 billion loan package to 
finance the Goodrich deal, people familiar with the matter said. HSBC Holdings PLC and Bank of America 
Corp.'s Bank of America.'s Merrill Lynch are also helping with the financing. 
United Technologies also plans to sell $4.2 billion in stock and will suspend its share buybacks through next year 
to maintain its credit rating following the deal. 
The company expects to cut about $350 million to $400 million in costs, mainly by eliminating functions Goodrich 
won't need now that it won't be a public company. 
United Technologies has deep roots in the U.S. aviation industry, tracing itself back to a company formed by 
William Boeing in 1929. That company was broken apart in 1934 in a move that created United Airlines, Boeing 
and United Technologies. 
The company began expanding out of aerospace in the 1970s with acquisitions of Otis Elevator and Carrier 
Refrigerator. 
Born and raised in Quebec, and now a U.S. citizen, Mr. Chenevert's beginnings at United Technologies are in 
aviation, starting at Pratt & Whitney in 1993. He rose to president of Pratt & Whitney in 1996 and served for a 
decade until being named president and chief operating officer for the parent company in 2006. 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz also advised United Technologies. Credit 
Suisse AG, Citigroup Inc. and law firm Jones Day advised Goodrich.

Presentation 
OPERATOR: Good morning and welcome to the United Technologies webcast call. On the call today from United 
Technologies are Louis Chenevert, Chairman and CEO and Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief 
Financial Officer. Also on the call today from Goodrich Corporation are Marshall Larsen, Chairman, President, 
and CEO and Scott Kuechle, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being carried live 
on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. The 
Company reminds listeners that any forward-looking statements concerning the proposed transaction and its 
financial and business impact provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC and Goodrich's 
SEC filings, including the 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual 
results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. (Operator Instructions) Please 
go ahead, Mr. Chenevert. 
LOUIS CHENEVERT, CHAIRMAN, CEO, UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP.: Good morning. We have exciting 
times at UTC. You always ask me about M&A and when are we going to do a deal and I've always answered that 
we have a disciplined approach to M&A. It has to be strategic to the core, it has to be in growth market, there's 
got to be the ability to apply the UTC model and exercise the synergies and its also got to be the right value. 
Goodrich perfectly fits these criteria and more. As you know, we've reached an agreement to acquire Goodrich, 
subject to usual closing conditions. Goodrich is a well-established position in aerospace systems with products 
that are largely complementary to Hamilton Sundstrand as well as Pratt & Whitney. 
Aftermarket content is attractive and like UTC, more than 40% of sales end with high growth expectation, so the 
timing is also very good. I'm bullish on aerospace and the whole team is bullish on aerospace. It's one of the few 
areas with a brighter outlook today. Goodrich, again, like UTC, is well-positioned with higher content on many 
new platforms. We're very excited to bring capabilities of 2 great companies together, making us more 
competitive, yielding significant value to both customers and our shareholders. We've got seasoned management 
teams, we've got similar culture, strong focus on growth, productivity and margin expansion, and the opportunity 
to apply the UTC model and coupled with ACE, our lean manufacturing discipline to further drive performance. 
There's excellent fit from nose to tail. 
Goodrich brings complementary product lines such as wheels and brakes, landing gears, nacelles, actuation and 
lighting systems. It's a great addition to Hamilton Sundstrand's strong suit of products with electric systems, 
environmental control systems and engine control systems. The combination will significantly increase our 
systems offering to air framers and allow greater integration across the platform, just as we did with the Hamilton 
systems on the 787. We reduced the wirings, the component, created value for the customers and for our 
shareholders and contributed to lower weight and fuel efficiency for these new aircraft. Timing is good as well. 
The aerospace sector is poised for upswing. Over a long period, air traffic has grown consistently. 
RPMs increased 6% annually for the last 40 years and they're expected to grow 5% for the next 20 years, 
supported by economic growth in emerging markets. Emerging market trends and replacement of older fleets also 
drive demand for these new aircraft. As you all know, Boeing's estimate 33,500 new airplane deliveries from 2011 
through 2030, compared with less than 20,000 in the last 20 years. Both Hamilton and Goodrich have high 
content on these new platforms. One of the questions we've asked ourselves, why increase defense exposure in 
this environment? And I've got Marshall here this morning to talk about the very strong position Goodrich has in 
this segment. 
MARSHALL LARSEN, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT & CEO, GOODRICH CORPORATION: Thanks, Louis. About 
30% of our sales are in defense and space within a very strong portfolio. First, we have a very broad presence 
and are not dependent in any 1 or 2 large programs. Second, we have a core business in priority areas such as 
electro-optical surveillance systems, precision guided systems, helicopter programs and the JSF; areas that are 
least likely to be impacted, even in the face of tighter defense budgets. In fact, our defense and space sales were

Page 36 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
up 8% organically in the first half of this year. Finally, even with programs that are ending, like the F-22, there is 
meaningful aftermarket sales for the foreseeable future. And as Louis said, just like UTC, Goodrich has a very 
strong aftermarket. 
43% of our sales come from the aftermarket and we have a very broad base of content on in-service platforms 
and even higher content on the new platforms. Air framers are increasing production rates driving substantial 
growth for current aircraft in production which will mature and lead to a solid aftermarket. And, new platforms like 
the 787, the A350, the Embraer 190, the A320 NEO with the GTF, MRJ, and C-series are coming market. 
Goodrich is on all those new platforms, and in fact, we have more content on those platforms then on the 
platforms we are replacing. So, broad positions and higher content a new platforms will drive sustainable, 
long-term aftermarket growth. With that, let me hand it back to Louis to talk about how this combination adds 
great value to our customers. 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: As we saw with the 787, customers are looking for substantial improvements in the 
next-generation aircraft. The trends are for more electric, more integrated and more intelligent aircraft. 
Combination of the UTC and Goodrich capabilities will create offerings such as more electric braking, integrated 
propulsion systems and vehicle health monitoring systems. These will provide systems with better performance 
and reliability, reduce complexity and maintenance for the end-users and lower overall cost to our customers. 
And, we will provide better value to airlines by leveraging Hamilton Sundstrand's recently opened 24/7 world-class 
customer response center. 
Customers will also benefit from expanded aftermarket network and excellent field support. Although we do not 
include sales synergies in our business case for M&A, we fully expect additional sales synergy as we leverage 
the capabilities of the 2 world-class product development, sales and aftermarket organizations. I'll come back and 
answer some questions you might have, but for now, let me hand it off to Greg to briefly talk about the synergies 
and valuation. 
GREG HAYES, SVP/CFO, UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP.: Good morning, everyone. Thanks, Louis. As we 
always talk about with these deals, the focus here is on real cost synergies. And similar to previous transactions 
like GE Security and the Sundstrand deal we did 10 years ago, we haven't included any sales synergies in our 
model, but we fully expect that this combination will eventually result in significant synergies, both on the cost 
side, as well as the top line. The cost synergies are going to come really from leveraging the combined volumes 
with our supply chain, rationalizing our facilities, optimizing our production capacity and consolidation of the back 
office, along with more efficiency in our E&D. We also get the benefits that UTC's typically get from the ACE 
operating system and along with the lean manufacturing principles that Goodrich has employed, we're going to 
have a strong focus on low-cost sourcing and low-cost manufacturing. We know how to integrate transactions. I 
think if you look back to what we've done over time with the fire and security transactions, with GE Security and 
others, we know how to do this. 
We'll have a dedicated team in place, we'll be looking at these synergies every single day. We're confident that 
this deal will be accretive by the second year and the IRR for this deal is well in excess of our cost of capital. 
Turning to valuation, price multiples are consistent with similar deals out the marketplace. We plan to use a 
combination of debt and stock to fund the transaction. Our current thinking is about 75% debt and 25% equity. 
Obviously, with the equity markets weak like they are today and have been for the last couple of months, the 
focus right now is on the debt markets. But we recognize we will have to issue equity, probably prior to close. 
We're also going to maintain our credit ratings; we've worked very hard to do that. We expect to have a good 
terms and a stable credit rating. We will be suspending share buyback through 2012 and significantly reducing 
that in 2013 and 2014; probably cutting it in half to about $1 billion a year. We're also going to take our M&A 
placeholder, which we typically have at $2 billion a year, and reduce it to $1 billion a year for the next couple of 
years; in all, things that we think we need to do to help maintain the credit rating. This deal creates value for both 
Goodrich and UTC shareholders, as well as our customers. The combination of UTC and Goodrich will make 
UTC a $66 billion Company, based on pro-forma 2011 results, with slightly less than 50% of our sales from the 
aerospace sector. As Louis said, the aerospace cycle is one of the few growth sectors in these uncertain times 
and the addition of a premier company, such as Goodrich, will significantly enhance our capabilities in the 
attractive aerospace systems space and aftermarket. 
UTC will remain a well-balanced enterprise with no single business driving more than 1/3 of sales. We remain 
well-positioned to serve the growing emerging markets with industry-leading franchises, game changing 
technologies and a seasoned management team focused on execution. Just to remind everyone of the principles 
we use in M&A, as Louis said at the start, we look for companies that are in the core, that are in growth markets, 
and have real synergies and create significant share owner value. The Goodrich acquisition should be no

Page 37 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
surprise to any of our share owners. We followed the principles in the Sundstrand acquisition, the Carriers 
acquisition of Linde, and as we built the fire and security segment through the acquisitions of Chubb, Kidde and 
recently, GE Security and we'll create value again with the Goodrich acquisition. Let's stop there and open up the 
call for questions if we could. 
Questions and Answers 
OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein. 
DOUG HARNED, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN & COMPANY, INC.: Could you walk through how you 
think about the different sources -- I'm assuming cost is the main thing that you've done this deal on. Could you 
walk through the different elements of that and what the relative size of different cost saving areas are likely to 
be? 
GREG HAYES: Sure. As we size the cost synergies, we think about 6% of the Goodrich cost base will result in 
synergies here. So we're thinking about $350 million to $400 million of synergies on a run rate basis. A little over 
$100 million is going to come from the SG&A, about $100 million from facilities, another $100 million from 
materials, and then a little bit from R&D and overhead. Again, I would tell you we think this is a very conservative 
estimate of these synergies. Alain Bellemare and Marshall will be working closely over the coming months to 
finalize these plans and get the integration teams working, but we think this $350 million to $400 million ought to 
be a slam dunk from a synergies standpoint. 
DOUG HARNED: Now if you look longer-term, I would assume that the efforts that you've done in sourcing in 
low-cost countries, Goodrich has been moving in that same direction, but you've done this quite extensively at 
UTC. Is this an area that you have also looked at here and attach some value to longer term? 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: Yes, definitely. As you know, we're not afraid of big goals at UTC and we have a good 
track record with our ACE operating system, with our supply chain also involved with the ACE operating system, 
as well as low-cost sourcing. It's substantial opportunities and we have leadership that knows how to do this. I 
think on the Goodrich side, there's also good leadership that knows how to do this and I think working jointly 
together, we'll be able to leverage what's already in place on both sides and optimize how we bring it together and 
create the value for the end customer, as well as for our shareholders. 
DOUG HARNED: And then if I can, you've looked at Goodrich for quite some time. Why now? What's different 
today than what you saw 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 4 years ago? 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: Well, I think it's been on our radar screen. Big deals are lumpy, it's not always easy to 
connect the seller with the buyers. We have very stringent criteria. It had to be in the core, it had to be that we 
could apply our model synergies. If you look, my last big deal was the GE Security which turned out to be 
accretive in year 1. We are very proud of what it did to our property. This is one, clearly, was on the radar screen 
and I think it's been in the works for over a year between Marshall and I. 
If you go back even in George's day, George had sometime Goodrich on his slides. So it's not new news that 
there was interest on our part. It's just that it kind of converged and where the time where we're early in the up 
cycle all the air framers have announced more volume on production of 73, on 320. I think our shareholders and 
our customers are going to like this a lot, that we have a brand-new set of capabilities and a bright future with this 
property after we close. 
DOUG HARNED: Okay, thank you. 
OPERATOR: Carter Copeland, Barclays Capital. 
CARTER COPELAND, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Good morning, gentlemen and congratulations on the 
transaction. 
GREG HAYES: Thanks, Carter. 
CARTER COPELAND: Just really a couple quick accounting questions for Greg and/or Scott. With respect to the 
differences in accounting and contract accounting that you guys use at Goodrich, Scott, when we look at the 
capitalized balance of excess over average and inventory, what should we be thinking are the duration of those 
contracts and when was the plan to begin working down that balance as opposed to adding to it? That's the first 
one. And the second is, do you have a sense of what sort of incremental amortization of intangibles you expect to 
see as a result of the deal?

Page 38 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
SCOTT KUECHLE, EVP & CFO, GOODRICH CORPORATION: Sure, Greg. This is Scott. I'd be happy to just 
comment on the contract accounting piece. First of all, we've got a lot of work to do over the next 6 to 8 months as 
we work to integrate and work toward closing to determine how we're going to handle things like this. So, all I can 
speak to is the Goodrich side. We're going to work on accounting policies, et cetera, going forward so we'll give 
you more information as we get closer to closing. But our view is that we're about at the peak level this year, next 
year, in terms of what we put on the balance sheet in contract accounting, as we have a large number of 
production programs where we're finishing up the pre-production R&D phase. 
And then, as we start to get into production on things like 787, there'll be some excess over average in the early 
stages and that will work down quickly as we start to reach our cost targets over the next couple of years. So, 
we're looking at $200 million to $300 million this year of additional, non-product inventory excess over average 
and that should start to work down over the next several years as we get more mature in production and as some 
of these programs complete. 
CARTER COPELAND: Do you have a sense of the average duration of those contracts? 5 years, 10 years? 
SCOTT KUECHLE: Some of those contracts go out 20 years. It's all over the map, based on different production 
programs. 
CARTER COPELAND: Okay, great. 
MARSHALL LARSEN: This is Marshall, Carter. One of the things that I think this combination does, it helps us 
totally rationalize our supply chain and our low cost country manufacturing and should help us move down that 
cost curve even faster. 
GREG HAYES: Carter, just to give you some of the numbers in terms of the amortization. First year, obviously, 
there's going to be some step up of the fixed assets and such and it's probably about $0.30 of impact from the 
first year amortization. That goes down to about a $0.15 a year average run rate. I think the other good news is 
that, again, as we conform Goodrich's accounting to UTC's accounting, we'll probably move away from the 
contract accounting that Goodrich has done over the last 10 years or so. What that does is give us an 
opportunity to probably get some of these costs behind us that have been capitalized. We'll take care of that in 
purchase accounting. The good news is, as Scott and Marshall were saying, we're coming down the curve quickly 
on the 787. That's probably the biggest issue that we've got out there, but we've looked and we're confident in 
Goodrich's plans on cost reduction and getting to a break even on that program relatively quickly. 
CARTER COPELAND: That's great. Thank you very much. Congratulations again. 
OPERATOR: George Shapiro, Access 342. 
GEORGE SHAPIRO, ANALYST, ACCESS 342: Just one follow-up on the accounting, there's also a difference in 
pension. Goodrich was able to move away from the high pension costs because you had something over 
whatever the exact number is, 80% of the people not on defined benefit anymore. How's that going to get affected 
in the combination here? 
GREG HAYES: We'll conform to the pension accounting to UTC methodology. It's not a big number for us. We 
think, as we look at Goodrich's pension funding, there's about 90% or so right now, I think, at a 5% discount rate. 
We'll see where the discount rates end up, but we don't anticipate a big impact from the pension as we conform it 
to UTC's plan. 
GEORGE SHAPIRO: And then, the other question, Greg, in terms of just to clarify, you're going to totally suspend 
the buyback next year so you're not going to even by shares to offset option and share creep? That share creep 
number is what, 8 million or 9 million shares a year? 
GREG HAYES: It's a little bit less than that, but typically we have to buy back about $500 million year to cover the 
dilution associated with option exercise. So, we'll see a little bit of a headwind from that next year. Again, it's all in 
the numbers as we look at accretion dilution for the next couple of years. Obviously, next year it's a bigger 
number as we take all the deal costs, we take the restructuring charges, take the amortization associated with the 
intangibles, but still solidly accretive by year 2. 
GEORGE SHAPIRO: Okay, thanks a lot and congratulations to both of you. 
OPERATOR: Cai von Rumohr, Cowen and Company.

Page 39 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
CAI VON RUMOHR, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Yes, thank you and let me join in congratulations. 
Could you give us some color? You haven't talked about potential regulatory hurdles and you haven't talked about 
your customers' reaction. Is the EU going to think this is okay? Is China going to think this is okay? Do Boeing 
and Airbus think this is okay? 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: Well, Cai, that's a very good question and good morning. Simply said, a lot of the 
Goodrich product line is complementary to what we do. We don't have landing gears and brakes, we don't have 
nacelles today. I talked to several European customers this morning before this call and I would say the level of 
energy and enthusiasm was very good from the customer. So, I think this is something we've done, acquisitions, 
before we know to do this and touch every customer worldwide and they know our culture. 
I think they like the UTC culture of how we deliver on time. We optimize value for them. So, I expect minimal 
issues in the whole process. We're going to do that by working our customers and making sure they're 
comfortable with our game plan. 
CAI VON RUMOHR: Okay. What sort of timetable should we think about this thing happening on? 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: I think most likely somewhere by the end of Q2 '12 or Q3 is probably the reasonable timing 
that we expect. 
CAI VON RUMOHR: Okay, a last quick one -- in your cost savings, I can understand SG&A and facilities. Help 
me understand how, combined, you get $100 million in material savings that you couldn't get individually? 
GREG HAYES: Cai, that's really just a question of leveraging the global supply contracts that we have and the 
global sourcing. Again, Goodrich is an $8 billion company, UTC is a $58 billion company. You put the two of us 
together and we just think there are natural opportunities, and we've actually identified some of those in due 
diligence, that give us high confidence that we can take about 3% of the cost out on the procurement side 
relatively quickly. 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: You've got to remember, Cai, we buy the same types of material whether it's titanium, 
nickel alloy, bearings, et cetera. All of a sudden, we aggregate all these after closing and it simplifies the 
relationship between us and the supply chain. We're going to certainly do that and more, in my view, as we move 
forward. 
CAI VON RUMOHR: Terrific. Thank you very much. 
OPERATOR: Howard Rubel, Jefferies. 
HOWARD RUBEL, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Thank you, good morning. Quite an exciting deal. Just 
a couple of follow-up questions -- first, for Greg, when you talk about the accretion in year 2, can you give us a 
sense of what that means? Where you got the number? 
GREG HAYES: Obviously, I'm not prepared today to give you the exact numbers for the dilution in year 1 and the 
accretion going forward, but clearly, as we work through this, and we've taken a look at the deal costs, we've 
taken a look at the synergy rollout, we're going to have solid accretion in year 2, primarily just from realizing the 
benefits on the SG&A and the overhead side initially. The supply chain will take a little bit longer to realize and the 
facilities rationalization even a little bit further. We probably get the full run rate synergies after about 4 years and 
obviously, the facilities are the long pole in the tent there. 
HOWARD RUBEL: What kind of cost of money did you assume in this? Is it kind of in the 4% range? 
GREG HAYES: In fact, it's even a little bit better than that. We're going to go to the market and probably borrow 
about $12 billion of the $16 billion purchase price. Most of that is going to be front-loaded on the yield curve. We'll 
do some 10-year, probably $3 billion, we'll probably do some 30-year, but most of this is going to be paid off in the 
first 5 years. If you think about it, we're generating over $5 billion of free cash flow ourselves every year. 
Without the burden of share buyback in the first year or so, we'll be able to pay this debt down relatively quickly. 
Overall interest cost that we've assumed for accretion dilution is just a little bit south of 3% in total for the $12 
billion of borrowing. 
HOWARD RUBEL: That's why I'm a little surprised about the equity, given the free cash flow, Greg. 
GREG HAYES: Well, again, we've said this in the past, keeping the credit rating, especially in times like this, it is 
sacrosanct. It is kind of like the dividend. We're never going to lose it. We worked very closely with the rating

Page 40 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
agencies. We knew that we had to do a little bit in terms of equity to hold the rating, we knew we had to suspend 
share buyback, but again, the deal makes sense, even with the issuance of 25% equity. In fact, it makes a heck 
of a lot of sense. 
HOWARD RUBEL: Thank you very much. 
OPERATOR: Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank. 
MYLES WALTON, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on the deal. Louis 
or Marshall, could you comment a bit about the culture between the companies? Oftentimes when you have deals 
of this size, that tends to make or break it. Do you think the workforce at Hamilton and Goodrich effectively are 
kind of prepared for it? Also, from a perspective of integration of the cultures, how soon after deal closure would 
you anticipate starting to blend the businesses together? Slide 10 in your chart show them more or less operating 
independent from one another, at least at the beginning. When do they start to blend and mesh together? 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: Let me start. Certainly, the cultures of the enterprise are quite similar and that's part of the 
attractiveness of this property. Not only do they have a great product portfolio, but the culture of ethics, of 
productivity, the culture of serving the customers, I think it's going to be very complementary. After closing, 
obviously, it's our intent, although the slide shows these businesses side-by-side, the fact is, the leadership of the 
Sundstrand business will then be very closely integrated in Charlotte to drive the maximum synergies, to drive 
maximum opportunity in front of us and I think that it's going to be a happy transition, in my view, as we move 
forward. The team, as you know, always in the UTC culture as we have the right formulas for incentive comp, for 
long-term incentives, to drive profound execution. I'm totally convinced that as their team joins our team, they're 
going to like the culture of enterprise and not only the prior track record, but going forward, the opportunities we 
have together. 
MARSHALL LARSEN: I would echo that. I think the blending of our 2 cultures is extremely important and during 
this time period where we've gotten to know, Louis and United Technologies better, we've come to the belief that 
our cultures are not different. That we really respect the individual, we treat our employees well, we have 
accountability and teamwork and we, as Louis said, highly value our ethical culture and that is not going to 
change because we're working together. 
MYLES WALTON: Louis, from a perspective of a competitor and customer of Goodrich, previously, or a partner 
in a lot of places, you probably have a read into measuring where they are on the ACE spectrum. As you look at it 
today, where do they stack up relative to the mix, gold, silver, at Hamilton? 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: Number one, is they have a very good culture, also, of continuous improvement and kaizen 
process et cetera. While it's, perhaps, slightly different than what we have, I think our ACE system is more 
comprehensive. I think they might come up the learning curve fairly quickly after closing. We're going to put some 
ACE experts in there to make sure that we train their workforce. But it's not going to be culture shock. That's the 
good news because they already have that embedded in them of continuous improvement. 
I see a lot of good momentum developing quickly and I would say as far as where they are today, well, obviously 
any new facility that comes on our system starts at pre-qualifying, but I think that will make it up the ladder fairly 
quickly to bronze and to silver. There's many facilities that I've been briefed on by Marshall and his team that 
appear to be at a very high level of performance. Some others, like any company, have a world of opportunities in 
front of him. We are going to implement our approach, but it's all going to be very good. 
MARSHALL LARSEN: The good news about continuous improvement through lean manufacturing or the ACE 
system at United Technologies is you never stop improving. And so, regardless of the level of any facility, we 
always find more ways to improve it. In fact, you know, and I've talked to our investors in the past, about the lean 
events that we do, we'll go back to a facility or a portion of a facility a year or 2 later and find even more ways to 
improve it. I think we have an opportunity in the 2 companies as we come together to learn the best practices on 
both sides. 
MYLES WALTON: Good. Thanks again and congratulations. 
OPERATOR: David Strauss, UBS. 
DAVID STRAUSS, ANALYST, UBS: Congratulations as well. The $500 million in costs, one-time P&L costs that 
you show on slide 8, Greg, is that all purchase accounting? Is that taking care of the capitalized costs? Does that 
include restructuring? What exactly all is in that number?

Page 41 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
GREG HAYES: That is all of the costs that actually are going to hit the P&L over the first couple of years. So, 
that's primarily restructuring-related costs, which can no longer go into purchase accounting. It's not, 
unfortunately, the good old days where you could take all that restructuring in the first year and bang it into the 
balance sheet. It's all got to get charged to the P&L. So, the lion's share of that is restructuring. 
DAVID STRAUSS: Okay. Would you expect, as part of trying to close this deal, would you expect to have to make 
any divestitures? Obviously, there is some overlap in terms of power systems and engine controls between 2 
businesses? 
GREG HAYES: We've done a pretty thorough analysis. Obviously, we've had good counsel from the antitrust 
guys at Wachtell Lipton, as well as our internal guys take a look at this. And for the most part, we think all of these 
businesses are complementary. Obviously, you point out there a couple of small overlaps, we're not anticipating 
any significant divestitures at all. We are obviously anticipating a second request from justice which will take the 
close out probably about 9 months. But really not anticipating anything in terms of significant divestitures. 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: And as I said in my opening remarks, some of their large businesses, we don't have today. 
Nacelle systems is not a business of ours today, landing gears and brakes, for those, there is absolutely no 
issues and there's just a couple tiny areas that we're going to work aggressively and it's all in our relationship also 
with the customers and how they see us creating the value for them in the future. We're going to work this 
aggressively over the next couple of months. 
DAVID STRAUSS: Okay. And last one for me -- Louis and Greg, in terms of timing doing this deal today, should 
we read anything into it in terms of a more difficult outlook as you look at your non-aerospace, res and 
commercial construction businesses as you look out to 2012 and maybe even 2013? Just a more difficult outlook 
there as compared to what you might have thought 3 to 6 months ago? 
GREG HAYES: No. We're very confident in the guidance that we've given for the year. We still remain 
well-positioned to grow earnings into the next couple of years. Look, the markets are difficult, we see it every day 
in the US and in Western Europe. But we're well-positioned, as Louis said, in the emerging markets and in the 
growth markets. As we've always said, deals happen when they happen. The stars have aligned perfectly here. 
We're very fortunate to be able to come together with Goodrich today and really, timing is just what it is. 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: Nothing has changed to what we've said before as far as the current status of business. 
We still see a lot of momentum in emerging markets. We still see the same parameters, deals happen when they 
happen. The way I look at this is, I've got a long road ahead of me. This is a target property that was a fabulous, 
basically complementary property to ours. 
I look at it from we're going to love this property, 10, 20 years out. This is always going to be a superb fit and 
we're going to create value for our customers and shareholders. It's unfortunate, you can't pick the day where you 
announce these things. But guess what, it's a great deal; it's always going to be a fabulous deal as we move 
forward. 
DAVID STRAUSS: Thank you very much. 
OPERATOR: Ron Epstein, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. 
RON EPSTEIN, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: In your prepared remarks, Louis, you mentioned that it 
would make both companies more competitive. If you could speak to where do you think you could get some 
revenue synergies specifically, be it that there isn't a lot of overlap? What areas do you think you could find that? 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: Well, I think what happens is a bit of what you saw in the Hamilton Sundstrand story. 
Because we had Sundstrand, when came a new platform that demands more efficiency, more integration, there's 
no doubt in my mind, we did a lot more on a single platform then the companies would have done on their own 
because we could integrate systems and create value for customers. Well, guess what, there's inside in a nacelle 
is an engine and one of the things we could do, for example, that will enhance the value for the end customer as 
we bring those businesses together, the same is true with the landing gear and brakes system and basically 
conveying the right messages in cockpit and all that. I think we're going to find ways, basically on all the new 
platforms of the future to see more volume, more business than the individual business would have seen 
individually or separately. 
GREG HAYES: Ron, keep in mind, too, our base case does not include any revenue synergies. I think that's all 
upside. Is a long-term play, but it is clearly upside to any of the valuation models that we've done.

Page 42 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
RON EPSTEIN: How big could that possibly be if we try to think about how to scope that out? Down the road, 
longer-term how could big could the revenue synergies be? 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: Well, let me just say, this is for another day, we'll discuss that. We're going to go and focus 
on closing this property first. We've got to understand the business, exercise the synergies and this will be icing 
on the cake when it all happens. But we need new platforms, we need new opportunities, but they will come. 
Aerospace is going to grow, as well as there will be a lot of things we could do across the businesses leveraging 
the E&D and being more competitive in how we package solutions, et cetera. 
RON EPSTEIN: And then just one last question if I may -- one that you actually brought up. Why increase 
defense here? I think we all know that Goodrich's defense business has been producing well. But the backdrop 
for defense is, without a doubt, is getting more difficult, right? How do you think about that risk, particularly 
longer-term? 
GREG HAYES: Clearly, as we looked at the Goodrich portfolio, one-third of the revenues do come from the 
defense side. But I think, as Marshall explained before, their portfolio is uniquely positioned, especially in what 
they call the ISR, the intelligence surveillance recon-type mission. They've got great, great technologies. It's a lot 
of small programs, and we all understand defense spending is going to be cut and we factored that into our 
valuation analysis. But as we look at the portfolio across Goodrich, it really will probably withstand the test of 
time here as we go through this process down in Washington. 
MARSHALL LARSEN: Ron, if you think about the Goodrich defense portfolio, Greg just gave you some prime 
examples of why it's kind of in a lot of the sweet spots of what will be funded. But you can also think of it in the 
other way -- what things aren't being funded? Like navy ship programs, ground vehicles, all parts of the defense 
portfolio that we don't play in, where we won't get whacked in a general cut across the board. So we feel very 
good about our defense portfolio being able to continue to move on and grow. 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: They also have nice content, if I could wrap it up here, on many of the new platforms that 
are essential to the DoD like the JSF, like the 53 kilo, et cetera, that is going to be a nice run, also, of new 
platforms for the future. 
RON EPSTEIN: Great. Congratulations and thanks. 
OPERATOR: Ajay Kejriwal, FBR. 
AJAY KEJRIWAL, ANALYST, FBR CAPITAL MARKETS: Just a question, the C919, how does this combination 
position you on that platform? Would you be able to get more content there? And are there any regulatory 
approvals that you need in China? 
GREG HAYES: Right now, obviously, Hamilton Sundstrand will be supplying the electric power distribution for the 
C919. We don't see there being a regulatory issue in terms of MOFCOM approval with the Chinese. Obviously, 
technology transfer and ITAR restrictions are first and foremost in our minds here, but we don't see a big issue 
there. 
AJAY KEJRIWAL: Good. And then Louis, this acquisition gets Hamilton above the $10 billion mark and that would 
leave basically just Fire & Security and Sikorsky below $10 billion. Is it fair to assume that future acquisition 
dollars would be those 2 segments? 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: I think it's very premature to comment at all on this. Obviously, I love $10 billion business, 
but here, obviously, we've made a giant step in the right direction. I think there is some small property still around 
for Fire & Security in the future, but for now, our focus is clearly on execution. Greg mentioned earlier, we're going 
to minimize our M&A pool for the next couple of years, from where it is. At the same time, our goal is always to 
outperform and basically, it's very, very premature to talk about anything else. We're going to do this transaction, 
we're going to bring it to closure, and our customers, shareholders will love the outcome. 
AJAY KEJRIWAL: Thank you. 
OPERATOR: Shannon O'Callaghan, Nomura Securities International. 
SHANNON O'CALLAGHAN, ANALYST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTL: A couple of follow-ups on the numbers -- 
the amortization in 2013 is going to be I guess around $200 million. In terms of this ramp on the synergies, is 
there enough that hits in '13 to offset the incremental amortization? Maybe a little more on how that flows 
through?

Page 43 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
GREG HAYES: Pretty close by year 2 offsetting the amortization. We still, of course, have some restructuring 
costs. That $500 million restructuring costs will play itself out over a few years, so you still have a hit from that, as 
well as the interest cost. But, clearly, you get solid accretion in year 2. 
SHANNON O'CALLAGHAN: Okay, and then, in year 1, just help me out there. $0.30 of amortization, I think you 
used the word dilutive for '12, what are the other big chunks in '12? How much of that is a big chunk of the $500 
million going to hit right away? Or what else is there besides $0.30 of amortization? 
GREG HAYES: You do have restructuring costs the first year. Actually, restructuring costs will probably ramp up 
into the second and third year as we look at the facility rationalization. You also have all of the deal costs, which 
will hit us when we close; the cost of issuing the securities and the debt and just a few other costs. You've also 
got, of course, the impact of not doing share buyback and so we factored that into the equation as well. But, look, 
it will be a one-time hit. We'll get in front of that number, we'll talk to you before Louis stands up in December and 
we'll give you some clear guidance on what that'll be. But probably take a couple more weeks to sort through it. 
SHANNON O'CALLAGHAN: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. 
OPERATOR: Thank you, I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to the speakers for closing 
remarks. 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: Very good. Thank you very much. As you can see, I'm very excited. Our whole teams are 
excited. This is a spectacular opportunity for United Technologies customers and shareholders and the Goodrich 
family. It's a well-run company that I think will fit smack in the middle of our core competency. We're going to 
continue to be very focused and it's all about execution and that's what the next phase is. So, thank you very 
much for your participation for this call. And, Marshall, any comments you want to make as we --? 
MARSHALL LARSEN: I think Louis started the whole thing off today with it's exciting times and it really is. We're 
looking forward to putting these 2 teams together and creating even more value. I have to say to all of you 
aerospace analysts out there that have been following Goodrich over the years, we thank you for your support 
and it's been a very great pleasure working with you. 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: Thank you very much. 
GREG HAYES: Thanks, everybody.

'Bullish On Aerospace,' UTC To Acquire Goodrich For $18.4 Billion 
'Bullish On Aerospace,' UTC To Acquire Goodrich For $18.4 Billion 
883 words

After word of the deal began leaking earlier this week, United Technologies [UTX] on Wednesday night said it has 
agreed to acquire aerospace and defense company Goodrich Corp. [GR] for $127.50 a share in cash, 
representing an enterprise value of $18.4 billion that includes $1.9 billion in assumed debt. 
About 70 percent of Goodrich's $8 billion in sales are in the aerospace sector, which UTC officials said yesterday 
is in the early stages of an "up-cycle" that has long-term potential supported by economic growth in emerging 
markets. 
"I'm bullish on aerospace and the whole team is bullish on aerospace," Louis Chenevert, UTC's chairman and 
CEO, said yesterday on an investor call. "It's one of the few areas with a brighter outlook today." 
Goodrich provides systems to a number of new and next-generation commercial aircraft, including the Boeing 
[BA] 787 and 737 Next-Generation, and the Airbus A350 and A380. 
The defense and space market makes up about 30 percent of Goodrich's sales. UTC officials said they are not 
overly concerned that the constrained outlook for defense spending will crimp this component of the pending 
acquisition because of Goodrich's position in the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems that 
remain in demand. 
The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2012 or sometime in the third quarter. 
Once it does, UTC will form a new division called Aerospace Systems that will consist of Hamilton Sundstrand 
and Goodrich. 
The acquisition will be financed through a combination of debt and equity, and as of now UTC believes the split 
will be 75 percent and 25 percent, respectively. 
In the second year of the combination, the company believes it will be solidly accretive to its earnings. That's 
when cost synergies begin to kick in. By year five of the merger, UTC said its conservative estimate of annual 
cost savings synergies will between $350 million and $400 million, stemming from lower administrative costs, 
facilities rationalization, supply chain efficiencies and low cost sourcing of materials. 
Nearer term, UTC said there will be a one-time $500 million loss associated with the purchase. 
With the additional debt it will be taking on to help fund the deal, UTC plans to work to maintain its credit rating by 
suspending its stock repurchase program through 2012 and likely cut the program in half in 2013 and 2014 to 
about $1 billion each year, Greg Hayes, UTC's chief financial officer, said on the call. And, for the next two years, 
UTC is going to reduce its $2 billion annual placeholder for acquisitions and reduce it to $1 billion, he said. 
In addition to cost savings from the merger, UTC said there is upside from sales synergies, although it provided 
no estimate. The upside here stems from more integrated system offerings and leveraging their respective 
aftermarket networks, the company said. 
Both UTC, through its Hamilton Sundstrand and Pratt and Whitney segments, and Goodrich provide commercial 
airframe builders with a slew of systems and subsystems. UTC officials said that for the most part the commercial 
aerospace offerings of the two companies are complementary and they expect regulators in the United States 
and overseas to back the deal. 
Hamilton Sundstrand develops and produces auxiliary and electrical power systems, environmental control 
systems, engine controllers and gearboxes, flight and cockpit controls and more for commercial aircraft. 
Goodrich develops and produces cargo systems, exterior lighting, air data, sensors and systems, landing gear,

Page 45 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
wheels and brakes, actuation flight controls and engine bleed systems, engine nacelles and thrust reversers, and 
more for commercial aircraft. 
Chenevert said that the capabilities of the two companies in commercial aerospace will be combined into more 
integrated customer offerings that will reduce costs and improve efficiencies. UTC said they expect to offer more 
integrated electric braking systems, vehicle health monitoring systems and propulsion systems. UTC's Pratt & 
Whitney division makes engines for commercial and military aircraft. 
Of Goodrich's defense business, Marshall Larsen, the company's chairman, president and CEO, said it is broad 
and not dependent on a single program or two. Through the first half of 2011, organic revenues in the defense 
and space business are up 8 percent, he said. 
In the defense and space sector, Goodrich has a core business around electro-optic surveillance systems, 
precision guidance, helicopter programs, and the new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, all areas that Larsen said are 
"least likely to be impacted" by reduced defense spending. 
Another key component to the defense business is the "meaningful" aftermarket sales it will be generating for the 
"foreseeable future," Larsen said. 
Indeed, Larsen and Chenevert both touted their companies' strong aftermarket sales, which account for more 
than 40 percent of revenues at both firms, and the expectations for growth here. 
UTC maintained its financial outlook for 2011 with sales of about $58 billion and earnings per share between 
$5.35 and $5.45. Combined with Goodrich, sales are expected to be around $66 billion, with an expanded 
position in commercial and military aerospace. 
UTC's financial advisers on the deal are J.P. Morgan and Goldman, Sachs & Co. , while Goodrich's advisers are 
Credit Suisse and Citi .

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Shares of aerospace company Goodrich Corp. on Thursday fell short of the 
$127.50 a share buying price offered by United Technologies Corp. as investors worried that European antitrust 
regulators would nix the deal. 
EU regulators rejected a $42 billion offer by General Electric Co. (GE, US) to buy Honeywell International Inc. 
(HON, US) in 2001. The deal would have combined the world’s largest maker of jet engines with one of the 
largest suppliers of cockpit equipment. 
But the UTC-Goodrich tie-up is different, according to Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with William Blair & Co. 
Honeywell would have given GE dominance the two mostly highly valued products on a plane, and the 
Europeans feared GE could then leverage that into additional sales for cabin or electrical equipment. 
Goodrich would merely expand the UTC’s broad suite of components, including landing gear, braking systems 
and lighting. “While the antitrust [concerns] are certainly appropriate, this merger is so complementary that it 
minimizes the risk it will be shot down,” Heymann said. 
“Minimal” antitrust resistance is expected for the deal, which is expected to close either in the second or third 
quarter next year, executives from UTC said on a call with analysts. The merger should add to earnings in its 
second year. 
Shares of Goodrich (GR, US) jumped 11% at last check to $120.40, having climbed sharply in previous sessions 
after word of merger negotiations leaked to the press. 
UTC (UTX, US), part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, saw its stock slip nearly 4% at $72. 
UTC announced late Wednesday it would buy Goodrich for $16.5 billion to increase its exposure to the world’s 
rapidly expanding commercial-aircraft fleet. On a per-share basis, the offered price is a 51% premium to the 
company’s six-month trading average of $84.50. 
“Goodrich is a great business with a solid product portfolio and significant aftermarket sales that complement 
UTC’s existing aerospace presence,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Louis Chenevert, in a statement 
Wednesday night. 
UTC said it would assume net debt of $1.9 billion, making Goodrich’s total enterprise value $18.4 billion. The 
conglomerate plans to fund the acquisition with debt and equity issuance, of which equity will account for 25% of 
the total. 
The company also took pains to maintain its credit rating, halting stock buybacks through 2012 and slashing its 
acquisition war chest to $1 billion a year from $2 billion to keep up its cash balance. 
“We’ll be able to pay this debt down relatively quickly,” UTC Chief Financial Officer Gregory Hayes commented on 
the call with analysts.

Hartford, Conn.-based UTC affirmed its 2011 profit outlook of $5.35 to $5.45 a share on revenue of $58 billion. 
UTC — which owns aviation-systems provider Hamilton Sundstrand, as well as the Pratt & Whitney jet-engine 
business and Sikorsky Aircraft — has been looking to buy additional aerospace assets for years, including 
Rockwell Collins Corp. (COL, US) and Honeywell International, as well as Goodrich. 
Charlotte, N.C.-based Goodrich, with its more than 25,000 employees, has been expanding lower-cost facilities 
overseas that also places its aircraft-maintenance business closer to emerging-market buyers for new aircraft. 
By 2030, the global fleet of commercial aircraft is expected to double in size, with the Asia-Pacific region 
becoming the world’s largest market for new planes. Read more about how Asia is driving demand for new 
aircraft. 
“Goodrich is well positioned to benefit from the new-build market, and eventually the aftermarket, as those 
aircraft progress through their life cycles,” wrote FBR analyst Patrick McCarthy in a recent note to clients. 
Last year, Goodrich reported nearly $7 billion in revenue, up about 4.6% from a year ago. Sales for 2011 are 
estimated to be $8 billion. 
About one-third of Goodrich’s business is supplying equipment to commercial-aircraft manufacturers, including 
Boeing Co. (BA, US) and EADS (EAD, FR) (EADSY, US) unit Airbus, which have plans over the long term to 
increase their production rates. 
This past week, Airbus said it was looking at a way of raising the production rate of its A320 jet to 50 a month 
after already committing to 42 a month by the end of 2012. Meanwhile, Boeing is ramping up production of its 
twin-aisle 787 Dreamliner and its single-aisle 737. 
Goodrich is one of the largest suppliers of landing gear. It also sells cockpit equipment and nacelles, which are 
the housing covers for jet engines. 
Another third of the company’s business is in the so-called aftermarket, which includes maintenance and 
retrofitting. That area has been in the doldrums as airlines reduce spending in the wake of higher fuel prices, but 
it’s slowly regaining momentum. 
The final third of the Goodrich business is in defense, which has benefited from U.S. demand for helicopters, 
surveillance and reconnaissance platforms, and unmanned aircraft. 
With more than 200,000 employees, United Technologies rang up roughly $54.33 billion in sales last year. 
In addition to its aerospace businesses, the conglomerate also provides building-security systems, Otis elevators 
and Carrier heating and ventilation equipment. 
Purchasing Goodrich would take United Technologies’ percentage of revenue derived from aerospace to 52% 
from 45%, according to Bernstein Research. 
The acquisition is subject to conditions including regulatory clearances as well as a vote of Goodrich’s holders. 
J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs advised UTC. Credit Suisse and Citigroup advised Goodrich. 
Shares of Goodrich fell short of the $127.50 a share buying price offered by United Technologies as investors 
worry that European antitrust regulators could nix the deal.|103

* Boosts United Tech's commercial jet business 
(Adds analyst quote, details) 
By Scott Malone and Paritosh Bansal 
Sept 21 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp has reached a $16.5 billion cash deal to acquire aircraft 
components maker Goodrich Corp , in what would be the diversified U.S. manufacturer's biggest deal in a 
decade. 
United Tech said on Wednesday it would pay $127.50 a share for Goodrich, a 47 percent premium over the 
stock's closing price last Thursday. It also includes $1.9 billion in assumed debt. 
The deal comes as blue-chip United Tech looks to cash in on the upswing in plane orders and production as 
declining global spending on defense pressures its military business. 
The acquisition can help it build critical mass in new aircraft technology and plane services as civil demand 
rebounds. 
Goodrich is poised to grow as key commercial plane programs such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and 
upcoming Airbus A320neo ramp up production. 
"It's a good deal," said Virginia-based defense consultant Jim McAleese. 
"This is definitely a step forward in the growth of United Technologies in commercial aerospace, and it reduces 
the company's exposure to defense," he said.

BUCKS M&A SLOWDOWN 
The deal comes despite a broad slowdown in merger activity globally, as market volatility and economic 
uncertainty give many firms a pause. 
But it shows large, well-capitalized companies are still willing to take on strategic transactions and financing 
remains available for companies with good credit.

Page 49 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Within the sector, the deal could also be a harbinger of more M&A as companies look to reduce their dependence 
on defense amid declining global spending. 
Goodrich supplies parts for Hartford, Connecticut-based United Tech's Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Hamilton 
Sundstrand's aircraft electronics. 
The deal is a big move for United Tech Chief Executive Louis Chenevert, who had long said he was interested in 
doing more deals but was having a hard time coming to terms with targets on price. 
"Goodrich delivers on all of our acquisition criteria. It is strategic to our core, has great technology and people, 
and strengthens our position in growth markets," said Chenevert, who ran the Pratt & Whitney unit before taking 
on the top job. 
The deal is United Tech's largest since its year 2000 showdown with General Electric Co over Honeywell 
International Inc . United Tech made a $36 billion offer for Honeywell, which GE topped. European regulators 
ultimately scuttled that deal. 
Goodrich CEO Marshall Larsen, a 34-year Goodrich veteran, will run the new UTC Aerospace Systems unit, 
which will be based in Goodrich's current home town of Charlotte, North Carolina. 
United Tech plans to sell $4.2 billion in stock and suspend share repurchases through next year to maintain its 
credit rating, according to the Wall Street Journal, which said JPMorgan Chase is leading a $15 billion loan 
package for the deal, with HSBC Holdings and Bank of America Corp 
also involved in the financing. 
United Tech shares have risen some 8 percent over the past year, outpacing the 6 percent rise of the Dow Jones 
industrial average . Goodrich is up 52 percent, with more than half of that run coming over the past week. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs & Co advised United Tech on the deal, while Credit Suisse and 
Citigroup advised Goodrich.

It would boost United Tech's presence in the commercial aviation business, as Goodrich supplies a host of parts 
to both European aerospace conglomerate EADS's Airbus division and to Boeing Co. 
It also supplies parts for Hartford, Connecticut-based United Tech's Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Hamilton 
Sundstrand's aircraft electronics. 
It would be a big move for United Tech Chief Executive Louis Chenevert, who had long said he was interested in 
doing more deals but was having a hard time coming to terms with targets on price.

United Technologies Reaches $18.4 Billion Deal To Buy Goodrich Corp. 
United Technologies Reaches $18.4 Billion Deal To Buy Goodrich Corp. 
By Kenneth R. Gosselin, The Hartford Courant, Conn.

Sept. 22--United Technologies Corp. announced Wednesday night that it has an $18.4 billion deal to acquire 
aerospace competitor Goodrich Corp., capping a week of media leaks and speculation about how the merger will 
reshape the industrial conglomerate. 
The deal would be the biggest ever for Hartford-based UTC, and could more than double the company's sales of 
flight systems and other equipment for jetliners. Goodrich, based in Charlotte, N.C., would complement UTC's 
Hamilton Sundstrand division. 
UTC offered $127.50 per share in cash for Goodrich stock, for a total of $16.5 billion -- a premium of more than 
40 percent over Goodrich's market value in the month before news reports of the deal. UTC will also assume 
$1.9 billion in Goodrich debt. 
"Goodrich delivers on all of our acquisition criteria. It's strategic to our core, has great technology and people, 
and strengthens our position in growth markets," Louis Chenevert, the UTC chairman and CEO, said in a written 
statement. 
Analysts have given the merger wide approval in part because it would make UTC a huge player with well over 
$10 billion in global aviation systems sales, in addition to more than $12 billion in jet engine sales by Pratt & 
Whitney. 
It remains unclear how the merger, which requires approval of federal antitrust regulators and Goodrich 
shareholders, would affect the combined companies' operations, worldwide and in Connecticut, and whether it will 
lead to deep personnel cuts. Goodrich has plants in West Hartford -- the former Chandler Evans Co. -- and 
Cheshire and Danbury. Hamilton Sundstrand has about 4,000 employees at its headquarters and plant in 
Windsor Locks. Goodrich has refused to say how many employees it has in Connecticut. 
"The senior leadership team of the combined business will be located in Charlotte, N.C.," UTC said in a press 
release issued late Wednesday, but it was not clear what that would mean for the structure and headquarters of 
Hamilton Sundstrand. 
Goodrich competes against Hamilton Sundstrand in making some flight control systems that equip both military 
and commercial aircraft. But the company, which shed its tire-making operations in 1988, would also round out 
Hamilton's offerings to include wheels, landing gear and brakes. 
"There's a lot of components that fit well with Hamilton Sundstrand," said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at 
William Blair & Co. in New York. "You want to get more and more critical mass on vital systems that you can bid 
as a package." 
The deal, by far, eclipses UTC's 1999 purchase of Sundstrand Corp., then valued at $4.3 billion -- about $5.2 
billion in today's dollars. At the time, Sundstrand was UTC's largest acquisition in two decades. 
Goodrich also was attractive because the defense industry accounts for about a third of its sales. In July, the 
company forecast continued growth in that segment, even in the face of looming cuts in U.S. defense spending. 
The deal marks a powerful statement in the legacy of Chenevert, who succeeded the wildly successful George 
David in 2008, and has made a number of smaller deals so far. David, who assembled the Fire & Security 
division, came close to a mega-deal with a proposed $40 billion takeover of Honeywell in 2000, but that merger 
didn't happen.

Page 52 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"He's taking a page out of George David's playbook," Heymann said, meaning Goodrich will fit well into UTC 
without requiring a turnaround. 
Chenevert has said that he would like to see each of UTC's divisions have $10 billion or more in annual sales. 
With $5.6 billion in annual sales, Hamilton Sundstrand lagged behind each of the other divisions, including the 
newest, Fire & Security. In recent years, the high-profile acquisitions at UTC have aimed at growing Fire & 
Security. 
Goodrich expects to have $8 billion in sales this year, employing 27,000 worldwide. UTC's sales will total about 
$55 billion and the company has more than 200,000 employees. 
Goodrich's chairman, president and CEO, Marshall Larsen, would become chairman and chief executive of a 
combined UTC Aerospace business unit. The scope of that unit was not clear late Wednesday. 
The acquisition will be funded by a combination of debt financing and newly issued stock, the latter representing 
about 25 percent of the purchase price.

UTC Deal Reached To Acquire Goodrich 
UTC Deal Reached To Acquire Goodrich

United Technologies Corp. agreed to buy aircraft-components maker Goodrich Corp. for $16.4 billion in cash, the 
company's biggest-ever acquisition and a signature deal for Chief Executive Louis Chenevert. 
The acquisition will strengthen United Technologies' exposure to the commercial aviation business at a time when 
the industry's order books are full, and it fulfills Mr. Chenevert's desire to find a deal big enough to add 
measurably to a company that expects $58 billion in revenue this year. 
It also sets United Technologies apart from other conglomerates like Tyco International Ltd., which announced 
plans this week to break into three companies. Tyco is betting the parts will be worth more than the whole, but 
United Technologies is moving in the opposite direction, believing it will win more business by offering a fuller 
menu of products to aircraft makers. 
"We are on the eve of a substantial ramp-up" for the commercial aviation industry, Mr. Chenevert said in an 
interview. "With the addition of Goodrich we really strengthened our aerospace position." 
United Technologies is paying $127.50 a share for Goodrich -- up 47% from where Goodrich shares closed last 
Thursday, before news of the deal leaked out, and 16% above Wednesday's closing price of $109.49, off 2.1% on 
the day. United Technologies shares fell 1.5% to $74.87, also on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The company anticipates it may need to make some minor divestitures to get approval from antitrust authorities. 
United Technologies already has three aerospace businesses -- Pratt & Whitney engines, Hamilton Sundstrand 
aircraft-control systems and Sikorsky helicopters -- but there is little overlap with Goodrich's leading products, 
which include landing gear and engine housings. 
Goodrich will be combined with Hamilton Sundstrand in a new unit that will be based in Goodrich's hometown of 
Charlotte, N.C., and run by Goodrich CEO Marshall Larsen. After the deal, nearly half of United Technologies' 
revenue will come from aerospace. 
United Technologies' aerospace businesses haven't been growing as fast as its three commercial building units, 
which sell Carrier air conditioners, Otis elevators and fire and security systems. The company invested $1 billion 
to develop a new jet engine -- the geared turbofan -- in an attempt to get back into the single-aisle-jet business, 
but is off to a slow start after being frozen out of Boeing Co.'s plan to refresh its 737 jetliner. 
The deal will allow the company to pitch itself as a supplier of systems throughout the plane, making it a tougher 
competitor to rivals like Honeywell International Inc. and French aerospace supplier Safran SA. It will also 
broaden United Technologies' exposure to commercial aviation as tight government budgets curtail defense 
spending. About a fifth of United Technologies sales are to the U.S. government. 
The deal "makes them an even more important player," said George Odden, a managing director in aerospace 
defense and government at investment bank Houlihan Lokey. 
A towering man with a broad smile and hint of a French accent, Mr. Chenevert, 54, took the reins at the Hartford, 
Conn.-based company three years ago. He succeeded George David, who was celebrated by investors for 
delivering consistent growth. 
Earlier this year, Mr. Chenevert decided the company needed a more aggressive merger-and-acquisition 
strategy. He had his first conversation with Goodrich's Mr. Larsen last September, and the two men had been 
talking every two months.

Page 54 of 70 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
United Technologies will focus on integrating the deal, but won't shy away from smaller transactions over the next 
few years, Mr. Chenevert said. 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is lead adviser to United Technologies and is heading up a $15 billion loan package to 
finance the Goodrich deal, people familiar with the matter said. HSBC Holdings PLC and Bank of America 
Corp.'s Bank of America.'s Merrill Lynch are also helping with the financing. 
United Technologies also plans to sell $4.2 billion in stock and will suspend its share buybacks through next year 
to maintain its credit rating following the deal. 
The company expects to cut about $350 million to $400 million in costs, mainly by eliminating functions Goodrich 
won't need now that it won't be a public company. 
United Technologies has deep roots in the U.S. aviation industry, tracing itself back to a company formed by 
William Boeing in 1929. That company was broken apart in 1934 in a move that created United Airlines, Boeing 
and United Technologies. 
Mr. Chenevert rose to president of Pratt & Whitney in 1996 and was named president and chief operating officer 
for the parent company in 2006.

UTC to acquire Goodrich for $16.5bn 
UTC to acquire Goodrich for $16.5bn

United Technologies has agreed to buy Goodrich, a maker of aircraft components, for about $16.5bn in cash in a 
move that boosts the industrial conglomerate's exposure to the fast growing aerospace sector. 
The deal is the biggest acquisition that UTC has made since Louis Chenevert took over as chief executive in 
2008 and bulks up the company's already substantial position in the aerospace sector. 
UTC owns Sikorsky, the helicopter maker; Pratt & Whitney, the engine company; and Hamilton Sundstrand, a 
component supplier, but in recent years a series of deals in the fire and security segment has increased the 
group's exposure to commercial and residential construction. 
Analysts said the deal would push UTC's aerospace revenues back to more than half of its total sales and would 
help revitalise its portfolio just as the sector begins a sustained production ramp-up. The company will have 
combined revenues of about $66bn in 2011. 
Goodrich, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, makes landing gear, aircraft interiors, electronic sensors and other 
components for the commercial aerospace and defence sectors. It had revenues of about $7bn in 2010. 
UTC said on Wednesday night that it would pay $127.50 a share in cash for Goodrich. The price represents a 
steep premium over the stock price before rumours of the deal first leaked and is towards the upper end of most 
analysts' predictions. 
UTC will also assume about $1.9bn of debt, giving Goodrich an enterprise value of about $18.4bn or just over 9 
times its forecast 2012 earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation, according to Credit Suisse. 
With the deal, UTC gains a company that is the leading or second largest business in each of its markets. 
Goodrich has also reported faster revenue growth, higher margins and quicker profit growth than UTC over the 
past five years. 
To finance the deal, UTC will tap about $15bn of loan capacity provided by a group led by JPMorgan and that 
includes HSBC and Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. UTC will also raise about $4bn in new stock and halt share 
buy-backs to maintain its credit rating. 
Investors have broadly welcomed the deal. Despite its large size and the potential dilution from the issuance of 
new stock, UTC's share price has climbed about 11 per cent over the past month, handily outperforming the S&P 
500 index. 
In a statement, Mr Chenevert said: "Goodrich is a great business with a solid product portfolio and significant 
after-market sales that complement UTC's existing aerospace presence." 
JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised UTC while Credit Suisse, Citigroup and 
Jones Day advised Goodrich.

United Technologies Is Near Deal for Goodrich 
Markets 
United Technologies Is Near Deal for Goodrich 
By Gina Chon And Kate Linebaugh 
576 words 
21 September 2011 
The Wall Street Journal Online 
WSJO

United Technologies Corp. is close to finalizing a deal to acquire aircraft-systems maker Goodrich Corp., as the 
conglomerate seeks to bulk up its aerospace business, people familiar with the matter said Monday. 
The parties are aiming to finalize a deal by the end of the week, the people said. But talks are continuing, 
including over price, and could still fall apart, the people added. 
United Technologies' aerospace-systems business at unit Hamilton Sundstrand ranks third in its market, behind 
leader Honeywell International Ltd. and No. 2 Goodrich and ahead of No. 4 Rockwell Collins Inc., as measured 
by revenue. 
In 1999, United Technologies merged its Hamilton unit with a rival it acquired, Sundstrand, and that pairing is 
credited with helping the company become a large supplier for Boeing Co.'s 787 Dreamliner jet. Bolstering that 
business further would be appealing for United Technologies, according to people familiar with the matter. 
United Technologies, based in Hartford, Conn., had about 208,000 employees at the end of last year, while 
Goodrich had about 25,600. 
A spokesman for United Technologies declined to comment. Goodrich, based in Charlotte, N.C., couldn't be 
immediately reached for comment. 
A United Technologies acquisition of Goodrich, with a market capitalization of about $14 billion, would be one of 
the biggest deals of the year. Goodrich shares rose 3.9% to $111.82 at 4 p.m. Tuesday in composite trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange, climbing sharply late in the session. Shares traded as high as about $114 on 
Friday in after-hours trading as news broke that United Technologies was considering an acquisition of Goodrich. 
Shares in United Technologies rose to $76.01 at 4 p.m. Tuesday, up slightly on the NYSE, giving the company a 
market capitalization of about $69 billion. 
Although the appetite for deal-making has waned in recent weeks because of market volatility and worries about 
the European debt crisis and economic outlook, some investment-grade-rated companies that can more-easily 
obtain financing—such as United Technologies—remain active in the mergers-and-acquisitions market. 
Companies also still have record amounts of cash on their balance sheets and are finding deals as an avenue for 
growth, deal makers say. 
In March, United Technologies named Bill Brown as head of corporate strategy to search out potential acquisition 
targets, reporting directly to Chief Executive Louis Chênevert. Mr. Brown previously ran UTC Fire & Security, 
which United Technologies started building in 2003 from scratch to a business with $6.5 billion in net sales last 
year. 
In the decade to 2010 just over half of United Technologies' $18 billion of acquisitions were in the fire-and-security 
business, including the $1.8 billion purchase of GE Security from General Electric Co. last year. 
The appointment of Mr. Brown suggested that United Technologies was eager to pursue a bolder and 
more-aggressive acquisition strategy. People familiar with the matter said the company seeks to bolster either of 
its core areas: commercial-building infrastructure such as elevators and security systems, or aerospace.

United Technologies also had other companies on its target list, including Rockwell Collins, which makes 
electronics for the aircraft industry, the people said. But United Technologies' priority turned to Goodrich, the 
people said.

United Technologies Corp. agreed to buy aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp. for $16.4 billion in cash, a 
person familiar with the matter said, the company's biggest acquisition in over a decade and a signature deal for 
Chief Executive Louis Chenevert. 
The acquisition will strengthen United Technologies' exposure to the commercial aviation business at a time when 
the industry's order books are full, and it delivers on Mr. Chenevert's desire to find a deal big enough to add 
measurably to a company that expects $58 billion in revenue this year. 
The move also sets United Technologies apart from other conglomerates like Tyco International Ltd., which 
announced plans this week to break into three companies. Tyco is betting the parts will be worth more than the 
whole, but United Technologies is moving in the opposite direction. 
United Technologies is paying $127.50 a share for Goodrich, the person said -- up 47% from where the stock 
closed last Thursday, before news of the deal leaked out, and up 16% from the closing price Wednesday. 
(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal website, WSJ.com.) 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is leading the $15 billion loan package for the deal, which also includes HSBC Holdings 
PLC and Bank of America Corp.'s Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, the person said. United Technologies also plans 
to sell $4.2 billion in stock and suspend its share buybacks through next year to maintain its credit rating following 
the deal. 
Goodrich will be combined with United Technologies' Hamilton Sundstrand unit, which produces aircraft control 
systems, the person said. The new unit will be based in Goodrich's hometown of Charlotte, N.C., and run by 
Goodrich CEO Marshall Larsen. [ 09-21-11 2020ET ]

Differences over price are an issue in deal talks between United Technologies Corp. and aircraft-systems maker 
Goodrich Corp. but the two sides are continuing negotiations, people familiar with the matter said Monday. 
United Technologies also has other companies on its target list, including Rockwell Collins Inc., which makes 
electronics for the aircraft industry, the people said. Shares of Rockwell Collins closed Monday at $53.87, giving 
the company a market capitalization of almost $8.3 billion. 
But United's priority appears to be Goodrich, which it has been considering for several months, the people 
added. 
Spokespeople for Rockwell and Goodrich weren't immediately reached. A spokesman for United Technologies 
declined to comment on the reported deal talks. 
(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal website, WSJ.com.) 
There was some hope among people familiar with the matter that United Technologies and Goodrich could reach 
an agreement as early as this week, but price differences and media reports may affect that timing, the people 
added. 
Banks not on the deal are scrambling to get tapped by one of the companies as advisers or to provide financing, 
other people familiar with the matter said. 
Goodrich shares traded around $114 per share in after-hours trading on Friday as news broke that the two 
companies were in talks. Goodrich, which has a market capitalization of about $13.5 billion, closed at $107.60 
per share Monday. 
United Technologies shares closed at $75.50 on Friday and closed around the same price at $75.55 on Monday. 
The company has a market capitalization of about $68.7 billion. 
In March, United Technologies appointed Bill Brown as head of corporate strategy to search out potential 
acquisition targets, reporting directly to CEO Louis Chenevert. Mr. Brown previously ran UTC Fire & Security, 
which United Technologies started building in 2003 from scratch to a business with $6.5 billion in net sales last 
year. 
In the decade to 2010, just over half of United Technologies's $18 billion of acquisitions were in the fire and 
security business. The crowning deal was the $1.8 billion purchase of GE Security last year. 
The appointment of Mr. Brown suggested that United Technologies was eager to pursue a bolder and more 
aggressive acquisition strategy. The company seeks to bolster either of its core areas -- commercial building 
infrastructure such as elevators and security systems, or aerospace, people familiar with the matter said. 
United Technologies's aerospace systems business at unit Hamilton Sundstrand ranks third in its market below 
leader Honeywell International Ltd. and no. 2 Goodrich, and above Rockwell Collins, as measured by revenues. 
In 1999, United Technologies merged Hamilton and Sundstrand, and that pairing is credited for getting the 
company to be a large supplier for the Boeing 787. Bolstering that business further would be appealing for United 
Technologies, according to people familiar with the matter. [ 09-19-11 2207ET ]

* UTX move could spur new wave of aerospace consolidation 
(Adds CNBC report on price talk) 
By Nadia Damouni, Philipp Halstrick and Soyoung Kim 
Sept 16 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp is lining up $10 billion to $20 billion in financing for a U.S. 
acquisition that could shape up as its biggest takeover in a decade, said people with direct knowledge of the 
matter. 
Investors bid up shares of smaller aerospace companies on the news, with speculation increasingly focused on 
Goodrich Corp as the most likely target of the diversified U.S. manufacturer. 
A move by United Tech could mark the start of a more aggressive phase of consolidation in the aerospace sector 
to prepare for cuts in defense spending in the United States and Europe. 
Goodrich, which is benefiting from rising demand for equipment for large commercial aircraft, makes the most 
strategic sense for United Tech, according to people familiar with the industry but not directly involved in the deal. 
Its chief executive, Marshall Larsen, is also preparing to retire in the next couple of years. 
Shares of Goodrich rose 7.4 percent on the NYSE. The stock surged another 20 percent after-hours to $112, 
valuing Goodrich at about $14 billion, after CNBC's David Faber reported that United Tech is expected to offer 
between $110 and $125 a share for the company and a deal could come as early as next week. 
Officials at United Tech, which makes products ranging from helicopters to air conditioners, declined to comment, 
as did those at Goodrich. 
Mergers could help the industry lower costs and boost capacity to meet booming demand for components used in 
commercial aircraft. 
A mid-tier aerospace company joining the United Tech group would gain access to more work, said Jim 
McAleese, a Washington-based defense consultant. 
"It would also expand United Technologies' footprint into the premium commercial aerospace portfolios, beyond 
their current work in engines through Pratt & Whitney," he said. 
Rockwell Collins Inc is also a good strategic fit for United Tech, industry insiders said, although compared to 
Goodrich, its revenue is more dependent on the defense sector. 
Shares of Rockwell Collins closed up 7.8 percent on the NYSE to give it a market value of $8.6 billion. Cessna 
aircraft maker Textron Inc shares finished 6.8 percent higher for a market value of $5.2 billion.

Reuters Insider looks at a possible United-Goodrich deal: 
http://link.reuters.com/faz73s 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> 
United Tech, which has a market value of about $68 billion, is still working on terms of an offer and any potential 
bid could still fall apart, said the people with direct knowledge of the situation. They asked not to be identified as 
the plans are confidential. 
Such a deal would be United Tech's largest takeover since its unsuccessful bid for Honeywell International Inc in 
2000. Since then, its largest acquisitions have been in the $1 billion to $3 billion range as it built up its fire and 
security division. 
United Tech shareholders took the news in stride. Its shares edged 0.1 percent lower to close at $75.50 on a day 
the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>, of which United Tech is a component, rose 0.7 percent. 
BIGGER BET? 
For most of the past five years, United Tech has budgeted $1.5 billion to $2 billion per year for takeovers, 
regularly making deals that are small enough that the Hartford, Connecticut-based company does not disclose 
their size. 
Company officials have repeatedly said they are interested in more deals, and in July Chief Financial Officer Greg 
Hayes suggested United Tech would not shy away from larger targets. 
"You're going to see us put our balance sheet to work, you're going to see us put more cash to work on the M&A 
side," Hayes said. "That's where I think a big piece of growth is going to come from in the next few years; it's 
going to come from the M&A." 
United Tech officials have expressed particular interest in targets to merge into its Fire and Security and Hamilton 
Sundstrand security and aircraft components arms. Both divisions are below Chief Executive Louis Chenevert's 
$10 billion annual revenue target. 
Acquiring either Goodrich or Rockwell, which are big suppliers to United Tech, could help the company weather 
the expected downturn in defense spending in the United States and Europe by giving it a larger share of the 
smaller pie that will remain, according to industry executives. 
U.S. congressional leaders last month agreed to cut $350 billion from national security spending over the next 
decade. 
For some veterans of the industry, the decline in defense spending brings to mind the late 1980s and early 1990s, 
when top U.S. defense officials told companies they should consider joining forces to cut costs. 
"This definitely feels like a return to those times," said one industry executive. "There are a lot of second-tier 
companies that will very likely be absorbed." 
Being acquired by a conglomerate like United Tech could allow the target company to retain some independence. 
United Tech has five divisions that operate under their own brand names, including Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton 
Sundstrand. 
RELUCTANT TO GO HOSTILE? 
Brian Langenberg, who follows United Tech at Langenberg & Co, said he would trust them to do a large-scale 
acquisition, even if it meant taking on substantial debt. 
"You don't get that many swings at something that size. It's a disciplined company," Langenberg said. "I've never 
seen them do something that doesn't make sense." 
As of July, the world's largest maker of elevators and air conditioners had done just $184 million in acquisitions 
this year and had $5.4 billion in cash on hand.

"UTX is well capitalized, corporate debt rates are near historical lows and the recent market sell-off has potentially 
made purchase prices a little more attractive," wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard in a note to 
clients. 
Chenevert, who came up through the company's aerospace business and headed Pratt & Whitney before taking 
the top job, holds up his $1.8 billion acquisition of General Electric Co's security business as the ideal deal. 
In 2008, United Tech made a hostile $2.64 billion takeover offer for Diebold Inc , a maker of automated teller 
machines. That effort was ultimately fruitless, and Chenevert has since said he would be reluctant to go hostile 
again.

UTC eyes potential M&A targets

UTC eyes potential M&A targets

If any United Technologies investors were still wondering if the deepening recession would damp the 
conglomerate's enthusiasm for acquisitions, UTC's five-and-a-half-hour presentation earlier this month left little 
doubt where its executives stood. 
"We're a willing buyer," said Louis Chênevert, UTC's chief executive, whose words were echoed repeatedly by a 
number of his lieutenants throughout the meeting. 
The conglomerate, which owns a range of businesses that include Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt & Whitney 
aircraft engines, is on the lookout for deals. UTC has set aside $2bn as a "place holder" budget that could be 
exceeded if the right opportunity emerged among the dozens of potential targets it has in its sights. 
Mr Chênevert also made it clear he would be willing to use the company's stock to help pay for larger acquisitions 
- piquing the interest of industry executives, analysts and advisers who have been waiting for the company to 
pursue an aerospace rival such as Rockwell Collins or Goodrich. 
Nicole Parent, an analyst with Credit Suisse, said UTC would probably be willing to stretch its M&A budget to 
$8bn. 
"There are nice businesses out there that fit terrifically," Ms Parent said. "But they aren't for sale." 
UTC needs willing sellers, though, and may find them as they turn to deals that would bolster some of their other 
businesses. 
Almost half of the $15bn UTC has spent on acquisitions since 2000 went to build out its fire and security unit, and 
the company wants to expand the division in the US. One possibility is Monitronics International, an 
alarm-monitoring company controlled by ABRY Partners. ABRY, a private-equity firm, has put the business up for 
sale, people familiar with its plans said. 
Textron has not ruled out selling some core businesses, including the conglomerate's Bell helicopter unit, to help 
weather a credit crisis that has punished its finance arm. Jeffrey Pino, who runs Sikorsky, called such a deal "an 
interesting hypothesis" earlier this month. 
The downturn has pulled many share prices to lows unseen in years. And much like the homeowner convinced 
his or her property is undervalued, chief executives are reluctant to sell divisions or entire companies at such 
depressed levels. 
But Jim Geisler, UTC's vice-president of corporate strategy and planning, says things are changing. "It's in the 
process of changing. Most CEOs can tell you their 52-week high. That process takes a little bit of time." 
Nick Heymann, an analyst with Sterne Agee, predicted the deals would not come until later this year. 
"You will see a lot of M&A once you see what the new normal is," said Frank Aquila, a partner with Sullivan & 
Cromwell. "The disjuncture of buyer expectations will lead to more unsoliciteds than we have seen for a long 
time."

While Mr Chênevert ruled out going "hostile" - as UTC did last year when the company sought to acquire Diebold, 
the maker of automated teller machines, after its efforts to negotiate with management failed - people familiar with 
the matter have argued UTC would consider going public with unsolicited offers.
