Karachi: Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company's fiscal fourth quarter and 
full-year 2010. For the fourth quarter ending September 30, 2010, GAAP net income was $774 million, an 
increase of 51% over the prior year. Diluted class A common stock earnings per share were $1.06, an increase of 
54% over the prior year. On an adjusted basis (excluding the revaluation of the Company's Visa Europe put 
option), net income for the quarter was $695 million, an increase of 35% over the prior year. Diluted class A 
common stock earnings per share were $0.95, an increase of 38% over the prior year. 
GAAP net operating revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010 was $2.1 billion, an increase of 13% over the 
prior year and driven by strong contributions across all revenue categories, in particular data processing and 
international transaction revenues. Currency fluctuations contributed a positive 1% towards quarterly net 
operating revenues. 
GAAP net income for the full-year was $3.0 billion, an increase of 26% over the prior year. Diluted class A 
common stock earnings per share were $4.01, an increase of 29% over the prior year. GAAP net operating 
revenue in the full-year was $8.1 billion, an increase of 17% over the prior year and was driven by strong 
contributions across all revenue categories. Currency fluctuations contributed a positive 1% towards full-year net 
operating revenues. 
On an adjusted basis (excluding the revaluation of the Company's Visa Europe put option), net income for the 
full-year was $2.9 billion, an increase of 23% over the prior year. Diluted class A common stock earnings per 
share were $3.91, an increase of 26% over the prior year. The Company's adjusted quarterly and full-year net 
income per class A common shares outstanding are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their 
most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables. 
Visa's results for both the fourth fiscal quarter and the full-year reflect the inclusion of CyberSource for the two 
months after its acquisition. 
"We are very pleased with our fourth fiscal quarter and full-year earnings results as we continue to successfully 
execute on our strategic initiatives while in the midst of a very challenging business environment," said Joseph 
Saunders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our continued focus, execution and resilience have enabled 
us to continue to generate solid returns and meaningful growth across our business, products and geographies." 
"Looking ahead to our fiscal 2011, Visa will continue to invest in initiatives and investments to grow our core and 
emerging product portfolios globally, innovate into new payments channels and integrate our recent acquisition of 
CyberSource. We are committed to delivering solid business performance, supporting our financial clients and 
partners, and delivering above average shareholder returns." 
Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2010 Financial Highlights: 
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis for the three months ended June 30, 2010 on which fiscal 
fourth quarter service revenue is recognized, was a positive 14% over the prior year at $802 billion. 
Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2010, was a

Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet, for the three months ended 
September 30, 2010, totaled 12.1 billion and were a positive 16% increase over the prior year. 
For the fiscal fourth quarter 2010, service revenues were $912 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year, 
and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized 
based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 15% over the prior year to $840 million. 
International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross border payments volume, grew 22% over the prior 
year to $619 million. Other revenues, which include the Visa Europe licensing fee, were $167 million, up 3% over 
the prior year. Volume and support incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $421 million and represent 
17% of gross revenues. 
Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $1 billion for the quarter, a less than 1% decline over the prior 
year. 
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale investment securities were $6.0 billion at 
September 30, 2010. 
Visa's GAAP effective tax rate was 38% for quarter ended September 30, 2010, excluding the revaluation of the 
Visa Europe put option. 
Fiscal Full-Year 2010 Financial Highlights: 
For the fiscal full-year, service revenues were $3.5 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year. Data 
processing revenues rose 29% over the prior year to $3.1 billion. International transaction revenues, which are 
driven by cross-border payments volume, grew 20% over the prior year to $2.3 billion. Other revenues, which

Volume and support incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $1.6 billion and represent 16% of gross

Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet for the 12 months ended 
September 30, 2010, totaled 45.4 billion, a 14% increase over the prior year.

Visa's GAAP effective tax rate was 37% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2010, excluding the 
revaluation of the Visa Europe put option. 
Notable Events: 
As previously disclosed, on October 4, 2010, Visa entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department 
of Justice (DOJ) and the attorneys general of seven states to resolve antitrust investigations into the Company's 
merchant acceptance rules in the U.S. The DOJ issued a civil investigative demand to Visa in 2008, seeking 
information about certain Visa acceptance rules, including those related to surcharging and discounting. Both 
investigations ended with a consent decree that sets forth the terms of the settlement, subject to court approval. 
There is no monetary obligation associated with the DOJ settlement. 
On October 8, 2010, the Company deposited $800 million into the litigation escrow account previously 
established under the Company's retrospective responsibility plan. The deposit into the escrow account reduced 
the conversion rate applicable to the Company's class B common stock from 0.5550 to 0.5102. On an 
as-converted basis, the deposit had the effect of a repurchase of approximately 11.0 million shares of class A 
common stock from the Company's class B shareholders. 
On October 20, 2010, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.15 per 
share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted 
basis) payable on December 7, 2010, to all holders of record of the Company's class A, class B and class C 
common stock as of November 19, 2010. In addition, the Company announced it has successfully completed its 
$1 billion share repurchase plan authorized in October 2009. In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, the Company 
repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $72.29 per share. Under 
the full plan, a total of 12.9 million shares of class A common stock was repurchased at an average price of 
$77.48 per share.

(1) Certain reclassifications, not affecting net income attributable to Visa, have been made to fiscal 2009 quarterly 
information to conform to the current period presentation format, including the reclassification of contractor 
expense, which was previously reported in professional and consulting fees, to personnel. 
(2) The Company began to report non-controlling interest (previously referred to as minority interest) as a 
component of equity in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and has updated all requisite financial statements, including 
the statement of operations, for all comparable periods presented as required under Accounting Standards 
Codification 810. 
Adjusted Net Income and Earnings Per Share 
US$ in millions, except per share data 
Management believes the presentation of adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share provides a clearer 
understanding of our operating performance for the periods. The revaluation of the Put option resulted in 
non-cash, non-operating income during the three months ended September 30, 2010. The reduction in value was 
primarily the result of declines in Visa's price-to-earnings ratio in the second half of fiscal 2010 and does not 
reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. Management therefore believes that 
the resulting non-operating income is not indicative of Visa's performance in the current or future periods.

Operational Performance Data 
The tables below provide information regarding the available operational results for the 3 months ended 
September 30, 2010, as well as the prior four quarterly reporting periods and the 12 months ended September 
30, 2010 and 2009, for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Included is a new table with 
information on the number of billable transactions processed on CyberSource’s network. Visa Inc. completed its 
acquisition of CyberSource Corporation on July 21, 2010. 
1. Branded Volume and Transactions 
The tables present total volume, payments volume, and cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, 
cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Card 
counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal and constant dollar growth rates over prior years are provided for 
volume-based data.

Footnote 
The preceding tables present regional total volume, payments volume and cash volume, and the number of 
payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and 
Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Nominal and constant dollar growth rates over prior 
years are provided for volume-based data. 
Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying the Visa, Visa 
Electron and Interlink brands for the relevant period; and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of 
cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance 
transfers and convenience checks; but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments 
volume plus cash volume. 
Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included 
in the tables. Debit programs include Visa’s signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs. 
The data presented is reported quarterly by Visa’s members on their operating certificates and is subject to 
verification by Visa. On occasion, members may update previously submitted information. 
Visa’s CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. For the 3 months 
ended September, 2009, Pakistan and Afghanistan were moved from the AP to CEMEA region. Several 
European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of 
countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Rest of World includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA 
and LAC.

Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency 
exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported (“Nominal USD”). These exchange 
rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the 
impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports 
year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency 
information (“Constant USD”). This presentation represents Visa’s historical methodology which may be subject to 
review and refinement.

* Visa to pay $2 billion for e-commerce company 
* Deal will help online and new payment technologies 
* New opportunities in Asia, Latin America (Adds investor comment, detail on valuation; updates stock price) 
By Maria Aspan 
NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - Visa Inc said on Wednesday that it would buy CyberSource Corp , a company 
that helps retailers accept online payments, to boost its business in emerging markets and online commerce. 
Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card processor, would pay $26 a share, or about $2 billion, for 
CyberSource. That amounts to a premium of nearly 34 percent over CyberSource's closing share price on 
Tuesday. 
"It's a pretty significant premium ... but if you look at the long-term value and the potential contribution to Visa 
down the road, certainly you can justify it as a multi-year payout," said Michael Nix, a portfolio manager at 
Greenwood Capital Associates, which includes Visa shares in its $800 million worth of assets under 
management. 
Visa's shares closed down 0.98 percent at $93.13, while CyberSource's surged 32.3 percent to close at $25.72. 
CyberSource was the second-most active stock on Nasdaq on Wednesday. 
Visa said the deal would increase its ability to process payments online, where analysts estimate that it already 
controls about 45 percent of the market. CyberSource's technology also makes it easier for retailers to accept 
new types of payments, including those made with mobile phones. 
"It ensures that they're going to continue to be very competitive in important growth parts of the market, whether 
it's online payments, mobile payments or international payments," said Richard Shane, an analyst at Jefferies & 
Co. 
CyberSource has an 11-year partnership with Visa. With partners and on its own, CyberSource processes 
about 25 percent of U.S. online commerce transactions. Its 295,000 merchant clients include British Airways Plc , 
Home Depot Inc , Facebook and Google Inc . 
Visa is increasingly dependent on new technologies and emerging markets for growth, now that most U.S. 
consumers use traditional credit or debit cards. 
Though Visa relies on the United States for 59 percent of its revenue, international sources should account for 
more than half by 2015, executives told investors last month. 
CALLING FOR GROWTH 
Mobile phone payments could be especially profitable for Visa in emerging markets, where the infrastructure for 
credit card payments is less developed, but cell phones are increasingly widespread. 
"CyberSource's key market opportunities are international, specifically Asia and Latin America," Visa Chairman 
and Chief Executive Joseph Saunders said on a conference call.

Page 76 of 77 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"This will be a significant focus, effective immediately." 
Visa and rival MasterCard Inc are fighting for market share in online payments as more consumers shop on the 
Internet, often using competitors such as eBay Inc's PayPal unit. 
Last week Ajay Banga, who will become MasterCard's next CEO in July, also identified emerging markets and 
e-commerce as priorities for the company. [ID:nN12177969]. MasterCard said it has created a new global 
research and development arm to work on such innovation. 
Other competitors have been investing in these areas as well, so Visa's deal does not necessarily give it a big 
advantage, said Scott Valentin of FBR Capital Markets. 
"But it definitely leapfrogs Visa in terms of where they were to where they are now," Valentin said. 
The deal is Visa's first acquisition since going public in March 2008. It is expected to close by September 30, and 
would reduce Visa's earnings for that quarter by about 4 to 5 cents a share. 
Visa is paying 25 times CyberSource's estimated earnings per share in 2011, according to Valentin, who called 
the price "a fair multiple" given CyberSource's market share. Other analysts and investors generally agreed, 
saying that most payment processors are valued at around 20 times their price-to-earnings ratio. 
"If you look at (CyberSource's) footprint and the relationships they have with a lot of the larger e-marketplace and 
social network sites, you can't argue that they are a leading name in that space," Nix said. 
PLENTY OF CASH 
CyberSource processes some transactions directly, but the majority of its business is providing security and 
fraud-management services to merchants. Visa said during the call that it would shift CyberSource away from 
the processing business, and refer the affected merchants to financial institutions that work with Visa. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co advised Visa on the deal, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc advised CyberSource. 
Saunders said during the call that Visa's "excess cash position remains strong even with this transaction." The 
San Francisco company had $4.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31. 
CyberSourcePresident and CEO Michael Walsh is expected to remain with Visa and oversee his company's 
operations after the deal closes. Chairman William S. McKiernan, who founded the company in 1994, will become 
an executive advisor to Visa during CyberSource's integration. (Reporting by Maria Aspan; Editing by Maureen

Credit card giant Visa said Wednesday it was buying online payments company CyberSource for two billion 
dollars. 
Visa said it had agreed to purchase CyberSource for 26 dollars a share, a premium of 37.25 percent over the 
Mountain View, California-based company's closing price on Tuesday. 
CyberSource, a rival to eBay-owned PayPal, said it manages about 25 percent of the electronic commerce 
business in the United States. Its clients include British Airways, Home Depot, Facebook and Google. 
"Online commerce continues to grow rapidly, and this acquisition will enable Visa to offer new and enhanced 
services," Visa chairman and chief executive Joseph Saunders said in a statement. 
"With CyberSource, we are adding a new suite of leading e-commerce capabilities and experience in addressing 
e-commerce merchant needs," he said. 
Saunders added that as e-commerce migrates to mobile devices, "we believe the combination of Visa and 
CyberSource technology and services will position Visa to lead in mobile e-commerce." 
Visa said CyberSource president and chief executive Michael Walsh will continue to oversee CyberSource's 
operations after the transaction closes.
