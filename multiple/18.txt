---------+ 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K, the other reports, statements, and information 
that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (which individually or together with its 
subsidiaries, as the context otherwise requires, is hereinafter referred to as 
"we," "Wal-Mart" or the "Company") has previously filed or that we may 
subsequently file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and public 
announcements that we have previously made or may subsequently make include, may 
include, or may incorporate by reference certain statements that may be deemed 
to be "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities 
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the 
protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that 
Act. The forward-looking statements included or incorporated by reference in 
this Form 10-K and that are or may be included or incorporated by reference in 
those reports, statements, information and announcements address our future 
economic performance, activities, events or developments that we expect or 
anticipate will or may occur in the future, including or relating, but not 
limited to, our expected results of operations for certain periods, including 
our expected sales or earnings per share for certain periods and our comparable 
stores sales from one period to another period, the amount, nature and 
allocation of future capital expenditures, opening of additional stores and 
clubs in the United States and additional units in the other countries in which 
we operate, conversion of discount stores into supercenters, relocations of 
existing units, remodeling of or special projects at existing units, expansion 
and other development trends of the retail industry, our ability to integrate 
newly acquired operations into our existing operations, our business strategy, 
our pricing strategy, our cost of goods, our inventory levels, the anticipated 
success and timing of various operating initiatives, our ability to increase our 
market share, our financing strategy, expansion and growth of our business, 
changes in our operations, including the mix of products sold, changes in 
expected sales of certain categories of products, our liquidity and ability to 
access the capital markets, the effect of economic developments on our 
customers, our operations and our results of operations, our annual tax rate, 
and other similar matters. Forward-looking statements are often identified by 
the use of words or phrases such as "anticipate," "believe," "could occur," 
"could result," "continue," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "plan," 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ]

Page 6 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"projected," "will be," "will continue," "will change," "will decrease," "will 
have," "will increase" and "will remain." Although we believe the expectations 
expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K and such 
reports, statements, information and announcements are based or will be based on 
reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business, a 
number of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those 
expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements, whether oral or written, 
made by us or on our behalf. Many of these factors have previously been 
identified in filings or statements made by us or on our behalf. 
Our business operations are subject to numerous risks, factors and 
uncertainties, domestically and internationally, that are outside our control. 
Any one, or a combination, of these risks, factors and uncertainties could 
materially affect our financial performance, our results of operations, 
including our sales, earnings per share or comparable store sales for any 
period, business operations, business strategy, plans, goals and objectives. 
These factors include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions, 
including the current economic crisis and disruption in the financial markets, 
unemployment levels, consumer credit availability, levels of consumer disposable 
income, consumer spending patterns and debt levels, inflation, the cost of the 
goods we sell, labor costs, transportation costs, the cost of diesel fuel, 
gasoline, natural gas and electricity, the cost of healthcare benefits, accident 
costs, our casualty and other insurance costs, information security costs, the 
cost of construction materials, availability of acceptable building sites for 
new stores, clubs and other formats, competitive pressures, accident-related 
costs, weather patterns, catastrophic events, storm and other damage to our 
stores and distribution centers, weather-related closing of stores, availability 
and transport of goods from domestic and foreign suppliers, currency exchange 
fluctuations and volatility, trade restrictions, changes in tariff and freight 
rates, adoption of or changes in tax and other laws and regulations that affect 
our business, costs of compliance with laws and regulations, the outcome of 
legal proceedings to which we are a party, interest rate fluctuations, changes 
in employment legislation and other capital market, economic and geo-political 
conditions and events, including civil unrest and terrorist attacks. Moreover, 
we typically earn a disproportionate part of our annual operating income in the 
fourth quarter as a result of the seasonal buying patterns. Those buying 
patterns are difficult to forecast with certainty. The foregoing list of factors 
that may affect our operations and financial performance is not exclusive. Other 
factors and unanticipated events could adversely affect our business operations 
and financial performance. Our business operations, results of operations, 
financial condition and liquidity are subject to other risk factors, which we 
discuss below under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors." Readers are urged to 
consider all of these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in 
evaluating the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements that we 
make or that are made by others on our behalf are based on a knowledge of our 
business and the environment in which we operate, but because of the factors 
described and listed above, as well as the other risks, uncertainties and other 
factors, or as a result of changes in facts, assumptions not being realized or 
other circumstances, actual results may differ materially from those 
contemplated in the forward-looking statements. Consequently, this cautionary 
statement qualifies all of the forward-looking statements we make herein and 
that are incorporated by reference herein. We cannot assure the reader that the 
results or developments expected or anticipated by us will be realized or, even 
if substantially realized, that those results or developments will result in the 
expected consequences for us or affect us, our business, our operations or our 
operating results in the way we expect. We caution readers not to place undue 
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates. 
We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements to 
reflect subsequent events or circumstances except to the extent required by 
applicable law.

WAL-MART STORES, INC. 
ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K 
FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2009 
PART I 
+---------+-------------------------------------------------+ 
| ITEM 1. | BUSINESS | 
+---------+-------------------------------------------------+ 
General 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Wal-Mart," the "Company" or "we") operates retail stores 
in various formats around the world and is committed to saving people money so 
they can live better. We earn the trust of our customers every day by providing 
a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at every day low prices 
("EDLP") while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect, 
integrity and diversity. EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price 
items at a low price every day so that our customers trust that our prices will 
not change under frequent promotional activity. Our fiscal year ends on January 
31. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009, we had net sales of $401.2 
billion. 
Our operations comprise three business segments: Walmart U.S., International and 
Sam's Club. 
Our Walmart U.S. segment is the largest segment of our business, accounting for 
63.7% of our fiscal 2009 net sales and operates stores in three different 
formats in the United States, as well as Wal-Mart's online retail operations, 
walmart.com. Our Walmart U.S. retail formats include:

+---+------+----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
----------+ 
At January 31, 2009, our International segment consisted of retail operations in 
14 countries and Puerto Rico. This segment generated 24.6% of our fiscal 2009 
net sales. The International segment includes numerous different formats of 
retail stores and restaurants, including discount stores, supercenters and Sam's 
Clubs that operate outside the United States. 
Our Sam's Club segment consists of membership warehouse clubs in the United 
States and the segment's online retail operations, samsclub.com. Sam's Club 
accounted for 11.7% of our fiscal 2009 net sales. Our Sam's Clubs average 
approximately 133,000 square feet in size. 
We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, 
Arkansas 72716, USA. 
The Development of Our Company 
Although Wal-Mart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses 
conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise 
Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. 
Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our 
founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In 
that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened 
in Rogers, Arkansas. In fiscal 1984, we opened our first three Sam's Clubs, and 
in fiscal 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In fiscal 1999, we opened our 
first Neighborhood Market. 
In fiscal 1992, we began our first international initiative when we entered into 
a joint venture in Mexico, in which we owned a 50% interest along with Cifra 
S.A. de C.V. ("Cifra"). In fiscal 1998, we acquired the controlling interest in 
Cifra, and in February 2000, Cifra officially changed its name to Wal-Mart de 
Mexico, S.A. de C.V. Since fiscal 1992, our international presence has continued 
to expand. At January 31, 2009, our International segment was comprised of our 
wholly-owned subsidiaries operating in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Puerto 
Rico and the United Kingdom, our majority-owned subsidiaries operating in five 
countries in Central America, and in Chile and Mexico, our joint ventures in 
India and China and our other controlled subsidiaries in China.

Page 9 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
At January 31, 2009, we operated 891 discount stores, 2,612 supercenters, 153 
Neighborhood Markets and 602 Sam's Clubs in the United States. At the end of 
fiscal year 2009, our International segment operated units in Argentina (28), 
Brazil (345), Canada (318), Chile (197), Costa Rica (164), El Salvador (77), 
Guatemala (160), Honduras (50), Japan (371), Mexico (1,197), Nicaragua (51), 
Puerto Rico (56) and the United Kingdom (358). We also operated 243 stores in 
China through a combination of joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
at January 31, 2009. At January 31, 2009, our Indian business consisted of 
wholesale cash-and-carry and back-end supply chain management operations through 
our joint venture with 
Bharti Enterprises and technical support to the retail 
stores of Bharti Retail through a franchise agreement.

Our Business Segments 
Our retail operations serve our customers through three segments. The Walmart 
U.S. segment includes our discount stores, supercenters and Neighborhood Markets 
in the United States as well as walmart.com. The Sam's Club segment includes the 
warehouse membership clubs in the United States as well as samsclub.com. The 
International segment consists of our operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, 
Chile, China, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Japan, 
Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom. You will find information 
concerning the financial results of our segments and the total and long-lived 
assets of each of those segments in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations. We have incorporated by reference in this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K our Consolidated Financial Statements as of January 31, 
2009, and for the year then ended, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations that are contained in our Annual Report to Shareholders, 
portions of which are included as an exhibit hereto. 
Walmart U.S. Segment 
The Walmart U.S. segment had net sales of $255.7 billion, $239.5 billion and 
$226.3 billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, 
respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single discount store, 
supercenter or Neighborhood Market location accounted for as much as 1% of total 
Company net sales. 
General. As a mass merchandiser of consumer products, the Walmart U.S. segment 
operates retail stores in all 50 states, with discount stores in 47 states, 
supercenters in 48 states and Neighborhood Markets in 16 states. Our discount 
stores range in size from 30,000 square feet to 219,000 square feet, with an 
average size of approximately 108,000 square feet. Supercenters range in size 
from 94,000 square feet to 260,000 square feet, with an average size of 
approximately 186,000 square feet. Neighborhood Markets range in size from

assortment of merchandise and services online at www.walmart.com .

Operations. Hours of operation for nearly all supercenters and an increasing 
number of discount stores and Neighborhood Markets are 24 hours each day. Hours 
of operation for the remaining discount stores, supercenters and Neighborhood 
Markets vary by location, but are generally 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 or 11:00 p.m., 
seven days a week. We accept a variety of payment methods including credit 
cards, debit cards and a private-label store credit card issued by a third-party 
provider. In addition, our pharmacy and optical departments accept payments for 
products and services through our customers' health benefit plans. 
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart U.S. segment's business is seasonal 
to a certain extent. Generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in the fourth

Page 15 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs 
during the first fiscal quarter. 
Competition. Our discount stores compete with other discount, department, drug, 
variety and specialty stores and supermarkets, many of which are national or 
regional chains. Our supercenters compete with other supercenter-type stores, 
hypermarts, discount stores, supermarkets, department, drug, variety and 
specialty stores, many of which are national or regional chains. We also compete 
with internet-based retailers and catalog businesses and with other retailers 
for new store sites. 
Our ability to develop the right locations and offer value and service to our 
customers largely determines our competitive position within the retail 
industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within 
our industry. These programs include the following: 
+-----+-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------- 
-----------+ 
| | - | | EDLP - our commitment to price leadership and our pricing 
philosophy | 
| | | | under which we price items at a low price every day so that our 
customers | 
| | | | trust that our prices will not change under frequent 
promotional | 
| | | | activity; 
| 
+-----+-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------- 
-----------+ 
+-----+-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------- 
-----------+ 
| | - | | Rollbacks - our commitment to continually pass cost savings on 
to the | 
| | | | customer by lowering prices on selected goods; 
| 
+-----+-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------- 
-----------+ 
+-----+-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------- 
-----------+ 
| | - | | Store Within a Store - a program to provide accountability to 
assistant | 
| | | | and department managers as to merchandise planning and overall 
department | 
| | | | performance; 
| 
+-----+-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------- 
-----------+ 
+-----+-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------- 
-----------+ 
| | - | | Store of the Community - a program to ensure that the 
merchandise | 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ]

Page 16 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
| | | | assortment in a particular store fits the demographic needs of 
the local | 
| | | | community in which that store is located; 
| 
+-----+-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------- 
-----------+ 
+-----+-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------- 
-----------+ 
| | - | | Clean, Fast and Friendly - our commitment to deliver a great 
customer | 
| | | | experience through fast, friendly service in a clean 
environment; | 
+-----+-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------- 
-----------+ 
+-----+-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------- 
-----------+ 
| | - | | Win, Play and Show - a strategy to select a merchandise 
assortment based | 
| | | | on our growth potential, economies of scale and customer 
credibility in | 
| | | | each business; and 
| 
+-----+-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------- 
-----------+ 
+-----+-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------- 
-----------+ 
| | - | | Save Even More - a strategy to meet or be below a competitor's 
| 
| | | | advertised price on key value items. 
| 
+-----+-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------- 
-----------+ 
In addition to these programs, we believe our broad assortment of merchandise 
that provides one-stop shopping, our in-stock levels that provide confidence to 
our customers that we will have what they need, and our long operating hours 
that allow customers to shop at their convenience, provide us with additional 
competitive advantages. 
Distribution. During fiscal 2009, approximately 81% of the 
Walmart U.S. 
segment's purchases of merchandise were shipped to the segment's stores through 
our distribution centers. The balance of merchandise purchased was shipped 
directly to stores from suppliers. General merchandise is transported to stores 
primarily through our private truck fleet. However, we contract with common 
carriers to transport the majority of our perishable and dry grocery 
merchandise.

Page 17 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Our Walmart U.S. segment operations are supported by 121 distribution facilities 
as of January 31, 2009, located strategically throughout the continental United 
States. Of these 121 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 106. Third 
parties owned and operated the remaining 15 distribution facilities. During 
fiscal 2009, the Company opened one food import distribution center and closed 
one walmart.com distribution center. In addition to servicing the Walmart U.S. 
segment, some of our Wal-Mart distribution centers also service our Sam's Club 
segment for certain items.

years ended January 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, were $98.6 billion, $90.4 billion 
and $76.9 billion, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single 
unit accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales.

operating in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Puerto Rico and the United 
Kingdom, our majority-owned subsidiaries operating in five countries in Central

other controlled subsidiaries in China.

During fiscal 2009, the Company disposed of 
Gazeley Limited ("Gazeley"), an ASDA 
commercial property development subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Consequently, 
the results of operations associated with Gazeley and the gain on disposal are 
presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income 
and Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. The cash flows 
related to this operation were insignificant for all periods presented. 
During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company initiated a restructuring 
program under which the Company's Japanese subsidiary, The Seiyu Ltd., will 
close 23 stores and dispose of certain excess properties. This restructuring 
will involve incurring costs associated with lease termination obligations, 
asset impairment charges and employee separation benefits, although any 
additional costs are not expected to be material. The costs associated with this 
restructuring and the results of operations of the affected stores and 
properties are presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated 
Statements of Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. 
The cash flows and accrued liabilities related to this restructuring were 
insignificant for all periods presented. 
In January 2009, the Company completed a tender offer for the shares of 
Distribución y Servicio D&S S.A. ("D&S"), acquiring approximately 58.2% of the 
outstanding D&S shares (the "First Offer"). D&S has 197 stores, 10 shopping 
centers and 85 PRESTO financial services branches throughout Chile. The purchase 
price for the D&S shares in the First Offer was approximately $1.55 billion. As 
of January 31, 2009, assets recorded in the acquisition after the First Offer, 
were approximately $3.6 billion, including approximately $1.0 billion in 
goodwill, liabilities assumed were approximately $1.7 billion and minority 
interest was approximately $395 million. Under the Chilean securities laws, the 
Company was required after the First Offer to initiate a second tender offer 
(the "Second Offer") for the remaining outstanding shares of D&S on the same 
terms as the First Offer. The Company completed the Second Offer in March 2009, 
acquiring approximately 16.4% of the outstanding D&S shares for approximately 
$430 million, resulting in the Company owning approximately 74.6% of the D&S 
shares. In connection with the transaction, the former D&S controlling 
shareholders were each granted a put option that is exercisable beginning in 
January 2011 through January 2016. During the exercise period, the put option 
allows each former controlling shareholder the right to require the Company to 
purchase up to all of their shares of D&S (approximately 25.1%) owned following 
the Second Offer at fair market value at the time of an exercise, if any. The 
consolidated financial statements of D&S, as well as the allocation of the 
purchase price as of January 31, 2009, are preliminary. 
Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for the International segment is similar

Page 24 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
to that of our operations in the United States in terms of the breadth and scope 
of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a 
majority of sales, numerous store brands not found in the United States have 
been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the 
International segment operates. In addition, steps have been taken to develop 
relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of 
quality merchandise. 
8
Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in the International 
segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending 
upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. We accept a 
variety of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards and private-label 
store credit cards issued by third-party providers. Other consumer finance 
programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the 
customer. 
Across the International segment, we are leveraging best practices, lessons from 
multiple store formats and global procurement practices. In addition, 
relationships with key global suppliers continue to help us leverage our volumes 
across countries. 
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The International segment's business is seasonal 
to a certain extent. Generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in the fourth 
fiscal quarter. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to 
different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as 
different climatic conditions. 
Competition. The International segment competes with a variety of local, 
national and international chains in the supermarket, discount, department, 
drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, 
wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses in each of the 
countries in which we operate and, in Mexico, with local, national and 
international restaurant chains. Our ability to offer our customers low prices 
on quality merchandise that offers exceptional value in the International 
segment determines, to a large extent, our competitive position. In our 
international units, our ability to operate the food departments effectively has 
a major impact on the segment's competitive position in the markets where we 
operate. 
Distribution. We utilize a total of 146 distribution facilities located in 
Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom and two 
export consolidation facilities in the United States. Through these facilities, 
we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating 
units of the International segment. During fiscal 2009, approximately 74% of the 
International segment's purchases flowed through these distribution facilities. 
Suppliers ship the balance of the International segment's purchases directly to 
our stores in the various countries in which we operate. Of these 146 
distribution facilities, we owned and operated 34 and leased and operated 34. 
Third parties owned and operated the remaining 78 distribution facilities. 
Sam's Club Segment

Page 25 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The Sam's Club segment had net sales of $46.9 billion, $44.4 billion and $41.6 
billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single club location 
accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales. 
General. As a membership club warehouse, we operate Sam's Clubs in 48 states. 
Facility sizes for Sam's Clubs generally range between 71,000 and 190,000 square 
feet, with the average Sam's Club facility being approximately 133,000 square 
feet. Sam's Club also provides its members with a broad assortment of 
merchandise and services online at 
www.samsclub.com .

Operations. Operating hours for Sam's Clubs are Monday through Friday from 10:00 
a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 10:00 
a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, all club locations offer a Gold Key program that

Page 28 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
permits business members to shop before the regular operating hours Monday 
through Saturday, starting at 7:00 a.m. 
Sam's Clubs are membership-only operations. A variety of payment methods are 
accepted at our clubs, including debit cards, some types of credit cards, and a 
private label and co-branded Discover credit cards issued by a third-party 
provider. In addition, our pharmacy and optical departments accept payments for 
products and services through our customers' health benefit plans. 
Members include both small business owners and individual consumers. Individual 
consumers are referred to as Advantage members. The annual membership fee for an 
individual Advantage member is $40 for the primary membership card, with a 
spouse/household card available at no additional cost. The annual membership fee 
for business members is $35 for the primary membership card, with a 
spouse/household card available at no additional cost. In addition, business 
members can add up to eight business associates (add-ons) to their business 
account for $35 each. Businesses can also purchase Advantage memberships for 
their employees under a Group Membership Program. Group rates are $30 per group 
Advantage membership when purchasing 50 - 999 memberships and $25 per group 
Advantage membership when purchasing 1,000 or more memberships. Sam's Club PLUS 
is a premium membership program that offers additional benefits and services. 
The annual fee for a Primary PLUS member (Business or Advantage) is $100. In 
addition, Business Plus primary members can add up to 16 business associates 
(add-ons) to their business membership for $35 each. 
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Sam's Club segment's business is seasonal to 
a certain extent. Generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in the fourth 
fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs 
during the first fiscal quarter. 
Competition. Sam's Club competes with other warehouse clubs, as well as with 
discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise 
wholesalers and distributors, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. 
Sam's Club competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new 
club sites. Our ability to offer low prices and quality merchandise to meet the 
needs of small business members largely determines our competitive position in 
the warehouse club industry. 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
Distribution. During fiscal 2009, approximately 65% of the Sam's Club segment 
non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sam's Club segment's dedicated 
distribution facilities and some of the 
Walmart U.S. segment's distribution 
centers for certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club 
purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. As of January 31, 2009, our Sam's 
Club segment operations were supported by 26 distribution facilities located 
strategically throughout the continental United States. Of these 26 distribution 
facilities, we owned and operated 8. Third parties owned and operated the 
remaining 18 distribution facilities. 
The principal focus of our Sam's Club's distribution operations is on 
crossdocking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized. Crossdocking is a 
distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound 
to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a

Page 29 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
crossdock facility, sometimes less than an hour. 
Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet as well as common 
carriers to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution centers to 
clubs. We contract with common carriers to transport perishable grocery 
merchandise from distribution centers to clubs. 
10 
Employees 
As of January 31, 2009, the Company and its subsidiaries employed over 2.1 
million employees ("associates") worldwide, with approximately 1.4 million 
associates in the United States and approximately 694,000 associates 
internationally. Like almost all retailers, the Company has a large number of 
part-time, hourly or non-exempt employees and experiences significant turnover 
in employees each year. In the United States, the Company offers a broad range 
of company-paid benefits to our associates, including the Wal-Mart Profit 
Sharing and 401(k) Plan, store discount cards or Sam's Club memberships, bonuses 
based on Company performance, matching a portion of purchases in the Associate 
Stock Purchase Program, and life insurance. The Company also offers health-care 
benefits to eligible full-time and part-time associates. The Company's medical 
plan has no lifetime maximum benefit for most expenses. 
In our operations outside the United States, the Company provides a variety of 
associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory 
requirements.

are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+ 
| ITEM 1A. | RISK FACTORS | 
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+ 
The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, 
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These risks are not 
the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by 
additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the United States 
and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that 
we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. 
General economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may adversely 
affect our financial performance. 
General economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, 
may adversely affect our financial performance. In the United States, higher 
interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the housing 
market, inflation, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer 
disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt 
levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, other regulatory 
changes, overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely 
affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our Walmart 
U.S. segment and Sam's Club segment, change the mix of products we sell to one 
with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases 
of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on 
inventory. Higher levels of unemployment, inflation, decreases in consumer 
disposable income, changes in tax and other laws, higher fuel and other energy 
costs, weakness in the local housing market, currency devaluations and other 
adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate 
may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries, 
especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than 
in the United States. These conditions may adversely affect our gross margins, 
cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect 
our operations and operating results in our International segment. 
11 
Higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, transportation costs, 
inflation, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, foreign exchange 
rates fluctuations, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, the 
imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated 
with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other 
economic factors in the United States and other countries in which we have 
operations can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and

Page 31 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and 
international operations and our operating results. The economic factors that 
affect our operations, also affect the operations and economic viability of our 
suppliers from whom we purchase goods, a factor that can result in an increase 
in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme 
cases, could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume 
typically available to us for sale. 
We may face impediments to our expansion in the United States, including 
conversions of discount stores into supercenters, which may adversely affect our 
financial performance. 
Our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts 
successfully in new markets within the United States and upon our ability to 
increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations. 
Our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood 
Markets and Sam's Clubs and to convert existing discount stores into 
supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and 
retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. 
Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings 
of the type in which we operate our various formats, as well as local community 
action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the 
adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations, may affect our 
ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into 
supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and 
states. Increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit 
our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into 
supercenters. If we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, 
Neighborhood Markets or Sam's Clubs or continue to convert discount stores into 
supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income 
growth, could be adversely affected. In addition, if consumers in the markets 
into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise 
not receptive to our presence in a market, our financial performance could be 
adversely affected. 
Impediments to the expansion of our International operations could adversely 
affect our financial performance. 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
Our business strategy for our International segment includes expansion by 
selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets 
to our existing International business, as well as opening new units in the 
countries in which we have existing operations. In the countries in which we 
have existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats already 
existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such 
as supercenters or Sam's Clubs, not previously operated in those markets. As in 
the United States, our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate 
existing stores in a market served by our International segment depends in large 
measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our 
ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect 
our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate 
units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units. In 
addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our 
ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in 
certain markets. Moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we 
expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the 
consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we 
anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such 
issues more difficult to achieve. If we do not effectively execute our expansion

Page 32 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
plans for our International segment, our financial performance could be 
adversely affected. 
We may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at 
acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any 
such candidate identified. Although we ultimately believe we will be able to 
successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing 
operations, no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be 
successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in 
a reasonable time. Our failure to identify appropriate candidates for 
acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and 
alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our 
International segment and our future financial performance. 
Failure to attract and retain qualified associates, changes in laws and other 
labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance. 
Our ability to continue to expand our operations in the United States and abroad 
depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of 
qualified associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability 
to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing 
stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and 
related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, 
including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the 
work force of the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within 
those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other 
insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and 
regulations. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified 
personnel, if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if 
new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations are adopted, our financial 
performance could be affected adversely. 
We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators, 
which could adversely affect our financial performance. 
The retail business is highly competitive. Each of our business segments 
competes for customers, employees, store sites, products and services and in 
other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional and 
national retailers, both in the United States and in the foreign countries in 
which we have operations. Our 
Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers 
operating discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, 
supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarts, as well as internet-based 
retailers and catalog businesses. Our Sam's Club segment competes with other 
wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale 
grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, as well as 
internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Internationally, 
we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, variety and specialty 
stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, wholesale clubs, 
internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Such retailers and wholesale 
club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise selection and 
availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store 
amenities and price. Our ability to offer value and service to our customers 
through various programs, including EDLP, Rollbacks, Store Within a Store and 
Store of the Community, have allowed us to compete successfully against our 
competitors in most instances. Where necessary to compete effectively with 
competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under 
our EDLP philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods for sale. Our ability to 
respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets 
could adversely affect our financial performance. See "Item 1. Business" above 
for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating

Page 33 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
segments. 
Although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments 
of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation, which could 
result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the 
retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly 
improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market 
penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their 
competitive positions. Such business combinations could result in the provision 
of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such 
consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. 
12 
Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the 
safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance. 
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and 
international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an 
important factor in our financial performance. All of our suppliers must comply 
with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be 
certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to 
find qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a 
timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect 
to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the United States. Political and 
economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, 
the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our supplier 
standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability of raw 
materials to suppliers, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange rates, 
transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation, and other 
factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located 
are beyond our control. In addition, the United States' foreign trade policies, 
tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on 
certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods 
or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors 
relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors 
affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our 
financial performance. 
Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding 
the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers and 
then sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or 
to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, 
even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence 
on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As 
such, any issue regarding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, 
regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our financial performance. 
Our International operations subject us to risks associated with the 
legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and 
conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could 
adversely affect our financial performance. 
We currently conduct operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica,

Page 34 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, and the 
United Kingdom, as well as through joint venture agreements in China and India 
and our other controlled subsidiaries in China. During fiscal 2009, our 
International operations generated 24.6% of our net sales. As a result of a 
recent acquisition of operations and our expansion activities in foreign 
countries, we expect that our International operations could account for a 
larger portion of our net sales in future years. Our future operating results in 
these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be 
negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our 
control. These factors include political conditions, including political 
instability, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, trade 
policies, both of the United States and of the other countries in which we 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
operate, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or 
regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Foreign currency exchange 
rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash 
flows from our International operations, and could adversely affect our 
financial performance. 
Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations 
have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency 
devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our 
financial performance. Other factors which may impact our International 
operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the 
United States and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of 
foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated 
with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically 
been less stable than the United States. Additional risks inherent in our 
International operations generally include, among others, the costs and 
difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and 
greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other 
than the United States. The various risks inherent in doing business in the 
United States generally also exist when doing business outside of the United 
States, and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous 
sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. 
Natural disasters and geo-political events could adversely affect our financial 
performance. 
The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods and 
earthquakes, other weather conditions, such as major winter storms, and 
geo-political events, such as civil unrest in a country in which we operate or 
in which our suppliers are located or terrorist attacks, both internationally 
and domestically, could adversely affect our operations and financial 
performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our 
properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution centers, 
the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term 
disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the 
disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in 
the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in 
which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our 
stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and 
disruption in our communications with our stores. These factors could otherwise 
disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial performance. 
The significant property damage experienced by the Company and others resulting 
from the hurricanes in fiscal year 2006 resulted in substantial increases in 
property insurance premiums and limitations in coverage offered by the property 
insurance markets to us and others. The insurance coverage offered to the

Page 35 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Company for named windstorms, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, was 
substantially more limited and carried higher premiums than the coverage 
previously available to us. As a result the Company has chosen to be primarily 
self-insured for losses that may result from named windstorms. 
13 
We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our 
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, 
employment, tort and other litigation. Certain of these lawsuits, if decided 
adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our 
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are currently a 
defendant in numerous cases containing class-action allegations in which the 
plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws. In 
addition, we are a defendant in Dukes v. 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , a class-action 
lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female employees in all of our 
retail stores and wholesale clubs in the United States. The class as certified 
in Dukes currently includes present and former female associates. The 
plaintiffs in this case allege that we have engaged in a pattern and practice of 
discriminating against women in promotions, pay, training and job assignments 
and seek, among other things, injunctive relief, front pay, back pay, punitive 
damages and attorneys' fees. On June 4, 2004, the U.S. district court hearing 
this case issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' 
motion for class certification, which we have appealed. On February 6, 2007, a 
divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit upheld the district court's ruling. On February 20, 2007, the Company 
filed a petition asking that the decision be reconsidered by a larger panel of 
the Court of Appeals. On November 11, 2007, the three-judge panel withdrew its 
opinion of February 6, 2007, and issued a revised opinion. As a result, the 
Company's Petition for Rehearing En Banc was denied as moot. The Company filed a 
new Petition for Rehearing En Banc on January 8, 2008. On February 13, 2009, the 
court of appeals issued an Order granting the Petition. The court of appeals 
heard oral argument on the Petition on March 24, 2009. We discuss these cases 
and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the 
caption "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial 
Statements, which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders which are 
incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as 
an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
If we do not maintain the security of customer-related information, we could 
damage our reputation with customers, incur substantial additional costs and 
become subject to litigation. 
As do most retailers, we receive certain personal information about our 
customers. In addition, our online operations at www.walmart.com and 
www.samsclub.com depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information 
over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A 
compromise of our security systems that results in customer personal information 
being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation 
with our customers and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, 
financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or

Page 36 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that 
we expend significant additional resources related to our information security 
systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our 
online sales operations. 
We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize 
results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and secondary 
(back-up) systems could harm our ability to run our business. 
Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and 
secondary computer systems, given the number of individual transactions we have 
each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our 
business critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including our back-up 
systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and 
telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic 
events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our 
employees. If our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged or cease 
to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or 
replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. 
Any material interruption in both of our computer systems and back-up systems 
may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In 
addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information 
technology processes and systems, which will include, for many of our computer 
systems, establishing common processes across our lines of business. The risk of 
system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, 
although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk. 
If we fail to integrate our computer systems and processes we may fail to 
realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. 
We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which 
could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our 
products and services, and our market share. 
It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and 
services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part 
on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and 
consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to 
changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns could negatively 
affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and 
services and our market share.

Clubs located in each state in the United States and the number of units located 
in each of the countries in which we operate at January 31, 2009 are disclosed 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
in our Annual Report to Shareholders under the caption "Fiscal 2009 End-of-Year 
Store Count" and are incorporated herein by reference. Portions of such Annual

United States. As of January 31, 2009, in the United States, we owned 3,100 of 
the buildings in which discount stores, supercenters and Neighborhood Markets 
operated and 483 of the buildings in which our Sam's Clubs operated. Land on 
which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the Company. In the 
United States, we lease the remaining buildings in which our stores and clubs 
operate from either commercial property developers pursuant to capital or 
operating lease arrangements or from local governmental entities in connection 
with industrial revenue bond financing arrangements. All store leases provide 
for annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease term. In 
some cases, the leases provide for additional rent based on sales volume. 
Substantially all of the Company's store leases have renewal options, some of 
which include escalation clauses causing an increase in rents. 
We use independent contractors to construct our buildings. 
Our 121 
Walmart U.S. and 26 Sam's Club distribution centers are located 
strategically throughout the continental United States. Of these 147 
distribution facilities, we owned and operated 114 distribution facilities and 
third parties owned and operated the remaining 33 distribution facilities. 
We own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas that serve as our home office 
and lease office facilities throughout the United States for our walmart.com 
operations and field management. 
International. We operate our International segment stores and restaurants in a 
combination of owned and leased properties in each country in which our 
International segment operates. As of January 31, 2009, we owned 23 properties 
in Argentina, 143 properties in Brazil, 118 properties in Canada, 94 properties 
in Chile, 63 properties in Costa Rica, 8 properties in El Salvador, 14 
properties in Guatemala, 7 properties in Honduras, 52 properties in Japan, 492 
properties in Mexico, 21 properties in Nicaragua, 11 properties in Puerto Rico 
and 232 properties in the United Kingdom in which operating units are located, 
with the remaining units in each such country and the properties in which the 
operating units are located in China being leased on terms that vary from 
property to property. We utilize both owned and leased properties for office 
facilities in each country in which we are conducting business. Our 
International operations are supported by 146 distribution facilities as of 
January 31, 2009. Of these 146 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 
34 and leased and operated 34. Third parties owned and operated the remaining 78 
distribution facilities.

II. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of 
certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance 
with that requirement: 
The District Attorney for Solano County, California, has alleged that the 
Company's store in Vacaville, California, failed to comply with certain 
California statutes regulating hazardous waste and hazardous materials handling 
practices. Specifically, the County is alleging that the Company improperly 
disposed of a limited amount of damaged or returned product containing dry 
granular fertilizer and pesticides on or about April 3, 2002. The parties are 
currently negotiating toward a resolution of this matter. While management 
cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe 
the outcome will have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or 
results of operations. 
The District Attorney for Orange County, California, has alleged that the 
Company's store in Foothill Ranch, California, failed to comply with certain 
California statutes regulating hazardous waste and hazardous materials handling 
practices. Specifically, the County is alleging that the Company improperly 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
disposed of a limited amount of damaged product containing dry granular 
pesticide on or about January 24, 2005. The parties are currently negotiating 
toward a resolution of this matter. While management cannot predict the ultimate 
outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a 
material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") approached a grocery industry 
group to resolve issues relating to refrigerant-handling practices and to reduce 
the use of ozone-depleting refrigerants in refrigeration equipment. The Company

then approached the EPA independently to address these issues, and proposed a 
plan for removing ozone-depleting refrigerants from certain types of 
refrigeration equipment. The parties are currently negotiating a resolution of 
this matter. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this 
matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on 
the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
In January 2007, 
Wal-Mart Puerto Rico, Inc. became aware that the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers ("USACE") was concerned about alleged violations of a permit 
issued by that agency in 2003, for the fill of 0.23 acres of a creek and its 
contiguous wetlands during the construction of the Wal-Mart Store in Caguas, 
Puerto Rico. On January 19, 2007, Wal-Mart Puerto Rico responded to these issues 
in writing. On January 25, 2007, the USACE issued a formal Notice of 
Non-Compliance to Wal-Mart Puerto Rico regarding this matter. Wal-Mart Puerto 
Rico filed a formal response and is currently implementing mitigation measures 
and working with the USACE to resolve the matter. While management cannot 
predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the 
outcome will have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or 
results of operations. 
On November 8, 2005, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United 
States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, seeking 
documents and information relating to the Company's receipt, transportation, 
handling, identification, recycling, treatment, storage and disposal of certain 
merchandise that constitutes hazardous materials or hazardous waste. The Company 
has been informed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of 
California that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential 
violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), the Clean 
Water Act and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Statute. This U.S. 
Attorney's Office contends, among other things, that the use of Company trucks 
to transport certain returned merchandise from the Company's stores to its 
return centers is prohibited by RCRA because those materials may be considered 
hazardous waste. The government alleges that, to comply with RCRA, the Company 
must ship from the store certain materials as "hazardous waste" directly to a 
certified disposal facility using a certified hazardous waste carrier. The 
Company contends that the practice of transporting returned merchandise to its 
return centers for subsequent disposition, including disposal by certified 
facilities, is compliant with applicable laws and regulations. While management 
cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe 
the outcome will have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or 
results of operations. 
Additionally, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of California 
has initiated its own investigation regarding the Company's handling of 
hazardous materials and hazardous waste and the Company has received 
administrative document requests from the California Department of Toxic 
Substances Control requesting documents and information with respect to two of 
the Company's distribution facilities. Further, the Company also received a 
subpoena from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office for documents 
and administrative interrogatories requesting information, among other things, 
regarding the Company's handling of materials and hazardous waste. California 
state and local government authorities and the State of Nevada have also 
initiated investigations into these matters. The Company is cooperating fully 
with the respective authorities. While management cannot predict the ultimate 
outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a 
material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
On March 28, 2008, the Company received a Notice of Violation from the Missouri 
Department of Natural Resources ("Department") alleging various violations of 
Missouri hazardous waste laws and regulations in connection with the activities

Page 41 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
of a third-party contractor with whom the Company had contracted for recycling 
services. The Department alleges that the Company provided certain items to the 
contractor for recycling that should have been managed as hazardous waste. The 
EPA has inspected the contractor's facilities, and both the EPA and the U.S. 
Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri are conducting 
investigations. The Company has submitted a response to the Notice of Violation 
and is cooperating with these authorities. While management cannot predict the 
ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will 
have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of 
operations.

+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
---------+ 
Certain information required to be provided in this item is incorporated herein 
by reference to the information included under the captions "Market price of 
common stock," "Listing" and "Dividends paid per share" in our Annual Report to 
Shareholders. Such information is included in an exhibit to this Annual Report 
on Form 10-K. 
Our common stock is principally traded in the United States on the New York 
Stock Exchange. At March 27, 2009, the latest practicable date, there were 
298,263 common stock shareholders of record. 
From time to time, we have repurchased shares of our common stock under a $10.0 
billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in 
September 2004. 
On May 31, 2007, the Board of Directors replaced the $10.0 billion share 
repurchase program, which had $3.3 billion of remaining authorization for share 
repurchases, with a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program announced on June 
1, 2007. Under the new share repurchase program, there is no expiration date or 
other restriction limiting the period over which we can make our share 
repurchases under the new program, which will expire only when and if we have 
repurchased $15.0 billion of our shares under the program. Under the new 
program, repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to unissued 
status. We consider several factors in determining when to execute the share 
repurchases, including among other things, our current cash needs, our capacity 
for leverage, our cost of borrowings and the market price of our common stock.

Page 46 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
At January 31, 2009, approximately $5.0 billion remained of the $15.0 billion 
authorization. As a result of the economic environment and instability of the 
credit markets, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in October 
2008. We reinstituted our share repurchase program in February 2009 and will 
continue to monitor market conditions in connection with our program. 
There was no share repurchase activity for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.

| ITEM 9A. | CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES | 
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+ 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to 
provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely 
disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In 
designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any 
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide 
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our 
management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and 
procedures. Also, we may have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. 
Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures 
with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we 
maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. 
In the ordinary course of business, we review our system of internal control 
over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to 
improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain 
an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities 
as implementing new, more efficient systems and automating manual processes. 
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure 
controls and procedures was performed as of the end of the period covered by 
this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the 
participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures 
are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be 
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to 
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, 
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are 
effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, 
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the 
SEC's rules and forms.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial

has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the 
Company's internal control over financial reporting.

| (1) | For fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, we considered comparable store sales to be 
sales at | 
| | stores that were open as of February 1st of the prior fiscal year and which 
had not | 
| | been converted, expanded or relocated since that date. Fiscal 2008 and 
fiscal 2007 | 
| | comparable store sales includes all stores and clubs that have been open 
for at | 
| | least the previous 12 months. Additionally, for those fiscal years, stores 
and clubs | 
| | that are relocated, expanded or converted are excluded from comparable 
store sales | 
| | for the first 12 months following the relocation, expansion or conversion. 
Fiscal | 
| | 2009 comparable store sales included sales from stores and clubs open for 
the | 
| | previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations and expansions.

The Seiyu, Ltd. | 
| | ("Seiyu") in Japan under a restructuring plan; and

---------+ 
| ? | The sale of Gazeley Limited ("Gazeley"), a property development subsidiary 
in the | 
| | United Kingdom. 
| 
+-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
---------+ 
Financial information for fiscal year 2005 has not been restated to reflect the 
impact of these activities as the adjustments are immaterial. 
Financial information for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 has been restated to 
reflect the disposition of our South Korean and German operations that occurred 
in fiscal 2007. 
The consolidation of Seiyu had a significant impact on the fiscal 2006 financial 
position amounts in this summary. 
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current 
presentations.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 
Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Overview 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Wal-Mart," the "Company" or "we") operates retail stores 
in various formats around the world and is committed to saving people money so 
they can live better. We earn the trust of our customers every day by providing 
a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at every day low prices 
("EDLP"), while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect, 
integrity and diversity. EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price 
items at a low price every day so that our customers trust that our prices will 
not change under frequent promotional activity. Our focus for Sam's Club is to 
provide exceptional value on brand-name merchandise at "members only" prices for 
both business and personal use. Internationally, we operate with similar 
philosophies. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. 
We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will 
assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key 
items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors 
that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles 
affect our financial statements. We also discuss certain performance metrics 
that management uses to assess our performance. The discussion also provides 
information about the financial results of the various segments of our business 
to provide a better understanding of how those segments and their results affect 
the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. 
This discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements as 
of January 31, 2009, and the year then ended and accompanying notes. 
Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income and comparable store 
sales. Segment operating income refers to income from continuing operations 
before net interest expense, income taxes and minority interest and excludes 
unallocated corporate overhead and results of discontinued operations. From time 
to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income as changes 
in business needs dictate. When we do, we restate all periods presented for 
comparative purposes. 
Comparable store sales is a measure which indicates the performance of our 
existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a 
particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. In fiscal 
2008 and fiscal 2007, our method of calculating comparable store sales included 
all stores and clubs that were open for at least the previous 12 months. 
Additionally, stores and clubs that were relocated, expanded or converted were 
excluded from comparable store sales for the first 12 months following the

Page 91 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
relocation, expansion or conversion. During fiscal year 2008, the Company 
reviewed its definition of comparable store sales for consistency with other 
retailers. For fiscal year 2009, beginning February 1, 2008, Wal-Mart revised 
its definition of comparable store sales to include sales from stores and clubs 
open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations and expansions. 
Changes in format continue to be excluded from comparable store sales when the 
conversion is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change 
in square footage of more than five percent. Since the impact of this revision 
is inconsequential, the Company will not restate comparable store sales results 
for previously reported years. Comparable store sales are also referred to as 
"same-store" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of 
calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a 
result, our calculation of comparable store sales is not necessarily comparable 
to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
Operations 
Our operations comprise three business segments: Walmart U.S., International and 
Sam's Club. 
Our Walmart U.S. segment is the largest segment of our business, accounting for 
63.7% of our fiscal 2009 net sales and operates stores in three different 
formats in the United States, as well as its online retail operations, 
walmart.com. Our Walmart U.S. retail formats include: 
+---+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

At January 31, 2009, our International segment consisted of retail operations in 
14 countries and Puerto Rico. This segment generated 24.6% of our fiscal 2009 
net sales. The International segment includes numerous different formats of 
retail stores and restaurants, including discount stores, supercenters and Sam's 
Clubs that operate outside the United States. 
Our Sam's Club segment consists of membership warehouse clubs in the United 
States and the segment's online retail operations, samsclub.com. Sam's Club 
accounted for 11.7% of our fiscal 2009 net sales. Our Sam's Clubs average 
approximately 133,000 square feet in size. 
For certain financial information relating to our segments, see Note 11 to our 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Retail Industry 
We operate in the highly competitive retail industry in both the United States 
and the countries we serve internationally. We face strong sales competition 
from other discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, warehouse 
clubs, and supermarkets, many of which are national, regional or international 
chains, as well as internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. We compete 
with a number of companies for prime retail site locations, as well as in 
attracting and retaining quality employees (whom we call "associates"). We, 
along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors 
including, but not limited to: general economic conditions, cost of goods, 
consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer 
credit availability, interest rates, customer preferences, unemployment, labor 
costs, inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, fuel and energy prices, 
weather patterns, catastrophic events, competitive pressures and insurance 
costs. Further information on risks to our Company can be located in "Item 1A. 
Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 
January 31, 2009.

impact of 1.2 and 0.7 | |

Our total net sales increased by 7.2% and 8.6% in fiscal 2009 and 2008 when 
compared to the previous fiscal year. Those increases resulted from our global 
store expansion programs, comparable store sales increases and acquisitions.

Comparable store sales is a measure which indicates the performance of our 
existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a 
particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Comparable 
store sales in the United States increased 3.5% in fiscal 2009 and 1.6% in 
fiscal 2008. Comparable store sales in the United States in fiscal 2009 were 
higher than fiscal 2008 due to an increase in customer traffic as well as an 
increase in average transaction size per customer. As we continue to add new 
stores in the United States, we do so with an understanding that additional 
stores may take sales away from existing units. During fiscal 2008, in 
connection with our revisions to our capital efficiency model, we revised our 
methodology for calculating the negative impact of new stores on comparable 
store sales. Using our new methodology, we estimate the negative impact on 
comparable store sales as a result of opening new stores was approximately 1.1% 
in fiscal 2009 and 1.5% in fiscal 2008. With our planned reduction in new store 
growth, we expect the impact of new stores on comparable store sales to decline 
over time. 
During fiscal 2009, foreign currency exchange rates had a $2.3 billion 
unfavorable impact on the International segment's net sales. Despite this 
unfavorable impact, the International segment's net sales as a percentage of 
total Company net sales increased slightly. Although movements in foreign 
currency exchange rates cannot reasonably be predicted, volatility in foreign 
currency exchange rates, when compared to prior periods, may continue to impact 
the International segment's reported operating results in the foreseeable 
future. The slight decrease in the Sam's Club segment's net sales as a percent 
of total Company net sales in fiscal 2009 and 2008, when compared to the 
previous fiscal years resulted from the more rapid development of new stores in 
the International and Walmart U.S. segments than the Sam's Club segment. We 
expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. 
In fiscal 2008, foreign currency exchange rates had a $4.5 billion favorable 
impact on the International segment's net sales, which increased the 
International segment's net sales as a percentage of total Company net sales. 
Additionally, the decrease in the Sam's Club segment's net sales as a percentage 
of total Company net sales in fiscal 2008 and 2007, when compared to the 
previous fiscal years resulted from the more rapid development of new stores in 
the International and Walmart U.S. segments than the Sam's Club segment.

Operating income growing faster than net sales is a meaningful measure because 
it indicates how effectively we manage costs and leverage expenses. For fiscal 
2009, our operating income increased by 3.9% when compared to fiscal 2008, while 
net sales increased by 7.2% over the same period. For the individual segments, 
our Walmart U.S. segment met this target; however, our International and Sam's 
Club segments did not. The International segment fell short of this objective 
due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Sam's Club segment 
fell short of this objective due to increases in operating, selling, general and 
administrative expenses ("operating expenses").

+--------------------------------------------------------+-+--+--------+-+-+--+---- 
----+-+-+--+--------+-+ 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased in fiscal 2009 
and 2008 as a result of increases in income from continuing operations in 
conjunction with share repurchases reducing the number of weighted average 
shares outstanding. 
Return on Investment 
Management believes return on investment ("ROI") is a meaningful metric to share 
with investors because it helps investors assess how efficiently Wal-Mart is 
employing its assets. ROI was 19.3% for fiscal 2009 and 19.6% for fiscal 2008. 
The decrease in ROI in fiscal 2009 resulted from our recent investment in Chile 
and the accrual for our settlement of 63 wage and hour class action lawsuits, as 
further discussed in footnotes 6 and 8, respectively, of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest 
income and depreciation and amortization and rent from continuing operations) 
for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average investment 
during that period. We consider average investment to be the average of our 
beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated 
depreciation and amortization less accounts payable and accrued liabilities for 
that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or 
trailing twelve months multiplied by a factor of eight.

Page 98 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC's rules. We 
consider return on assets ("ROA") to be the financial measure computed in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") that is the 
most directly comparable financial measure to ROI as we calculate that financial 
measure. ROI differs from return on assets (income from continuing operations 
before minority interest for the fiscal year or the trailing twelve months 
divided by average of total assets of continuing operations for the period) 
because: ROI adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and add 
interest income; it adjusts total assets from continuing operations for the 
impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and 
accrued liabilities; and it incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total 
invested capital. 
Although ROI is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for 
calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to 
calculate ROI may differ from the method other companies use to calculate their 
ROI. We urge you to understand the method used by another company to calculate 
its ROI before comparing our ROI to that of the other company. 
5
The calculation of ROI along with a reconciliation to the calculation of ROA, 
the most comparable GAAP financial measurement, is as follows:

Free Cash Flow 
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities of 
continuing operations in the period minus payments for property and equipment 
made in the period. Our free cash flow increased in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 
due to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities of continuing 
operations and the reduction in our capital expenditures primarily associated 
with our planned slowing of store expansion in the United States. 
Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC's rules. 
Management believes, however, that free cash flow is an important financial 
measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance, which 
measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations. 
Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute 
for, income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance or net 
cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations as a measure of 
our liquidity. Additionally, our definition of free cash flow is limited and 
does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures 
due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt 
service and other obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. 
Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as supplemental to 
our entire statement of cash flows. 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities of 
continuing operations, a GAAP measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure.

Results of Operations 
The following discussion of our Result of Operations is based on our continuing 
operations and excludes any results or discussion of our discontinued 
operations. 
Consolidated Results of Operations 
Our total net sales increased by 7.2% and 8.6% in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 
when compared to the previous fiscal year. Those increases resulted from our 
global expansion programs, comparable store sales increases and acquisitions. 
During fiscal 2009, foreign currency exchange rates had a $2.3 billion 
unfavorable impact on the International segment's net sales, however, the 
International segment's net sales as a percentage of total Company net sales 
increased slightly. In fiscal 2008, foreign currency exchange rates had a $4.5 
billion favorable impact on the International segment's net sales, causing an 
increase in the International segment's net sales as a percentage of total net 
sales relative to the

Page 104 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments. 
Our gross profit as a percentage of net sales (our "gross profit margin") was 
23.7%, 23.5% and 23.4% in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our Walmart 
U.S. and International segment sales yield higher gross profit margins than our 
Sam's Club segment. However, our International segment produced lower segment 
net sales increases in fiscal 2009 compared to sales increases in fiscal 2008 
due to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal 
2009. The gross profit margin increase in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 
was primarily due to lower inventory shrinkage and less markdown activity as a 
result of more effective merchandising in the Walmart U.S. segment. 
Additionally, the increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2008 included a $97 
million refund of excise taxes previously paid on past merchandise sales of 
prepaid phone cards. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 19.1%, 18.8% and 18.5% for 
fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In fiscal 2009, operating expenses 
increased primarily due to higher utility costs, a pre-tax charge of 
approximately $352 million resulting from the settlement of 63 wage and hour 
class action lawsuits, higher health benefit costs and increased corporate 
expenses compared to fiscal 2008. Corporate expenses have increased primarily 
due to our long-term transformation projects to enhance our information systems 
for merchandising, finance and human resources. We expect these increased 
expenses from the transformation projects to continue in the foreseeable future. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were higher in fiscal 2008 than 
the preceding year primarily due to lower segment net sales increases for our 
Walmart U.S. and International segments, as well as increases in certain 
operating expenses in each segment. In fiscal 2008, operating expenses were 
favorably affected by the change in estimated losses associated with our general 
liability and workers' compensation claims, which reduced accrued liabilities 
for such claims by $298 million before tax, partially offset by pre-tax charges 
of $183 million for certain legal and other contingencies. Additionally, the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 included $106 million of pre-tax charges related 
to U.S. real estate projects dropped as a result of our capital efficiency 
program. The net impact of these items had no effect on our operating expenses 
as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008. 
7
Membership and other income, which includes a variety of income categories such 
as Sam's Club membership fee revenues, tenant income and financial services 
income, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2009 was consistent with the 
prior year. Membership and other income as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 
year 2008 increased compared to the prior year due to continued growth in our 
financial services area and in recycling income resulting from our 
sustainability efforts. Membership and other income for fiscal 2008 also 
includes the recognition of $188 million in pre-tax gains from the sale of 
certain real estate properties.

Page 105 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Interest, net, as a percentage of net sales was consistent between fiscal 2009 
and fiscal 2008. Interest, net, as percentage of net sales increased slightly in 
fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to increased borrowing levels 
and higher interest rates on our floating debt. 
Our effective income tax rate was 34.2% for fiscal years 2009 and 2008, and 
33.5% for fiscal year 2007. The fiscal 2009 effective tax rate was consistent 
with that of fiscal 2008. The fiscal 2008 rate was higher than the fiscal 2007 
rate primarily due to the mix of earnings among our domestic and international 
operations and favorable resolution of certain federal and state tax 
contingencies in fiscal 2007 in excess of those in fiscal 2008.

The segment net sales growth resulted from comparable store sales increases of 
3.2% in fiscal 2009 and 1.0% in fiscal 2008, in addition to our continued 
expansion activities. Strength in the grocery, health and wellness and 
entertainment categories as well as strong seasonal sales throughout the year 
also contributed to the fiscal 2009 net sales increase. 
Comparable store sales were higher in fiscal 2009 due to an increase in customer 
traffic, as well as an increase in average transaction size per customer. 
The Walmart U.S. segment expansion programs consist of opening new units, 
converting discount stores to supercenters, relocations that result in more 
square footage, as well as expansions of existing stores. During fiscal 2009 we 
opened two discount stores, 23 Neighborhood Markets and 165 supercenters

Page 106 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
(including the conversion and/or relocation of 78 existing discount stores into 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
supercenters). Four discount stores and two Neighborhood Markets closed in 
fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2009, our total expansion program added 
approximately 22.7 million or 4.0% of additional square footage, net of 
relocations and closings. During fiscal 2008 we opened seven discount stores, 
20 Neighborhood Markets and 191 supercenters (including the conversion and/or 
relocation of 109 existing discount stores into supercenters). Two discount 
stores closed in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, our total expansion program 
added approximately 26 million or 4.8% of additional square footage, net of 
relocations and closings. 
In fiscal 2009, gross profit margin increased 0.3 percentage points compared to 
the prior year primarily due to decreased markdown activity and lower inventory 
shrinkage. These improvements are attributable to our merchandising initiatives 
which are improving space allocation, enhancing our price leadership and 
increasing supply chain efficiencies. In fiscal 2008, gross profit margin 
increased slightly compared to the prior year primarily due to higher initial 
margins and decreased markdown activity as a result of improved inventory 
management in the second half of the year, partially offset by higher inventory 
shrinkage. In addition, gross profit for fiscal 2008 included a $46 million 
excise tax refund on taxes previously paid on past prepaid phone card sales. 
Segment operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 0.3 
percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year due to 
hurricane-related expenses, higher bonus payments for store associates, higher 
utility costs and an increase in health benefit costs. 
Segment operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 0.2 
percentage points in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007, primarily due to lower 
segment net sales increases compared to the prior year and higher costs 
associated with our store maintenance and remodel programs. In fiscal 2008, 
operating expenses were favorably affected by the change in estimated losses 
associated with our general liability and worker's compensation claims, which 
reduced accrued liabilities for such claims by $274 million before tax, 
partially offset by pre-tax charges of $145 million for certain legal and other 
contingencies. 
Other income in fiscal 2009 increased from the prior year due to continued 
growth in our financial services area. Other income in fiscal 2008 increased 
from the prior year due to continued growth in our financial services area and 
increases in recycling income. Additionally, other income for fiscal 2008 
includes pre-tax gains of $188 million from the sale of certain real estate 
properties.

At January 31, 2009, our International segment was comprised of our wholly-owned 
subsidiaries operating in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Puerto Rico and the 
United Kingdom, our majority-owned subsidiaries operating in five countries in 
Central America, and in Chile and Mexico, our joint ventures in India and China 
and our other controlled subsidiaries in China. 
The fiscal 2009 increase in the International segment's net sales primarily 
resulted from net sales growth from existing units and our international 
expansion program, offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates of $2.3 billion. Our international expansion program 
added 517 units and 29.2 million or 13.1% of additional unit square footage, net 
of relocations and closings. The acquisition of 
Distribución y Servicio 
contributed 197 stores and 9.6 million square feet in fiscal 2009. 
The fiscal 2008 increase in the International segment's net sales primarily 
resulted from net sales growth from existing units, our international expansion 
program and the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
of $4.5 billion. Our international expansion program added 364 units and 34.1 
million or 17.9% of additional unit square footage, net of relocations and 
closings. The consolidation of Bounteous Company Limited ("BCL") contributed 
101 stores under the Trust-Mart banner and 17.7 million square feet in fiscal 
2008. 
For additional information regarding our acquisitions, refer to footnote 6 of 
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Page 108 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
In fiscal 2009, the International segment's gross profit margin decreased 0.3 
percentage points compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven 
by growth in lower margin fuel sales in the United Kingdom and the transition to 
EDLP as a strategy in Japan. 
In fiscal 2008, gross profit margin increased by 0.2 percentage points largely 
driven by Brazil and the United Kingdom. Gross profit in Brazil was favorably 
impacted by global sourcing initiatives and improved supplier negotiations. 
Fiscal 2008 gross profit in the United Kingdom was positively impacted by a mix 
shift toward premium, private-label food products. 
Segment operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 
slightly in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of 
strong cost control measures in the United Kingdom and every day low cost 
initiatives in Japan designed to support the shift to EDLP, partially offset by 
accruals for certain legal matters. 
Segment operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 0.3 
percentage points in fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of an accrual for certain 
legal matters, the impact of restructuring and impairment charges at Seiyu, the 
impact of the consolidation of BCL, the startup of our joint venture in India 
and banking operations in Mexico and overall sales pressures in Mexico. 
Other income as a percentage of segment net sales in fiscal 2009 was consistent 
with the prior year. 
In fiscal 2009, foreign currency exchange rate changes unfavorably impacted 
operating income by $266 million. Although movements in foreign currency 
exchange rates cannot reasonably be predicted, volatility in foreign currency 
exchange rates, when compared to prior periods, may continue to impact the 
International segment's reported operating results in the foreseeable future. In 
fiscal 2008, foreign currency exchange rate changes favorably impacted operating 
income by $227 million.

fiscal 2009 and 4.9% in fiscal 2008, along with our continued club expansion 
activities. 
The Sam's Club segment expansion program consists of opening new units, 
relocations that result in more square footage, as well as expansions of 
existing clubs. Eleven new clubs opened in fiscal 2009 and 12 new clubs opened 
in fiscal 2008. No clubs were closed for fiscal 2009 or 2008. In fiscal 2009, 
our total expansion program added approximately 1.7 million or 2.1% additional 
club square footage, net of relocations. In fiscal 2008, our total expansion 
program added approximately 2.0 million, or 2.6%, of additional club square 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
footage, net of relocations. 
Comparable club sales increased during fiscal 2009 due to growth rates in food 
and consumables as well as an increase in member traffic and transaction size 
per member. Comparable club sales in fiscal 2008 increased compared to fiscal 
2007 primarily due to growth in food, pharmacy, electronics and certain 
consumables categories as well as an increase in both member traffic and average 
transaction size per member. Additionally, fuel sales had a positive impact of 
1.2 percentage points for fiscal 2009 and 0.7 percentage points in fiscal 2008 
on comparable club sales. 
Gross profit margin increased 0.1 percentage points during fiscal 2009 compared 
to the prior year due to strong sales in fresh food and other food-related 
categories, consumable categories and the positive impact of a higher fuel gross 
profit rate. In fiscal 2008, gross profit margin increased 0.2 percentage points 
compared to the prior year due to strong sales in fresh food and other 
food-related categories, pharmacy and consumable categories, in addition to the 
$39 million excise tax refund on taxes previously paid on prior period prepaid 
phone card sales. 
Segment operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 0.2 
percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2009,

Page 110 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
operating expenses were negatively impacted by higher utility costs, an increase 
in health benefit costs, and hurricane related expenses. 
Segment operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 0.1 
percentage points in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007, primarily due to a decrease 
in advertising costs. Additionally, in fiscal 2008, operating expenses were 
favorably affected by the change in estimated losses associated with our general 
liability and worker's compensation claims, which reduced accrued liabilities 
for such claims by $21 million before tax, partially offset by pre-tax charges 
of $15 million for certain legal contingencies. 
Membership and other income, which includes a variety of income categories, 
increased in fiscal 2009 when compared to fiscal 2008. Membership income, which 
is recognized over the term of the membership, increased in fiscal 2009 compared 
to fiscal 2008. Membership and other income increased in fiscal 2008 when 
compared to fiscal 2007.

Overview 
Cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations supply us 
with a significant source of liquidity. The increases in cash flows provided by 
operating activities of continuing operations for each fiscal year were 
primarily attributable to an increase in income from continuing operations and 
improved working capital management. 
10 
Working Capital 
Current liabilities exceeded current assets at January 31, 2009, by $6.4 
billion, a decrease of $4.0 billion from January 31, 2008, largely due to a 
reduction in commercial paper outstanding at January 31, 2009. Our ratio of 
current assets to current liabilities was 0.9 at January 31, 2009 and 0.8 at 
January 31, 2008. We generally have a working capital deficit due to our 
efficient use of cash in funding operations and in providing returns to 
shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and payment of dividends. 
Company Share Repurchase Program 
From time to time, we have repurchased shares of our common stock under a $10.0 
billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in 
September 2004. 
On May 31, 2007, the Board of Directors replaced the $10.0 billion share 
repurchase program, which had $3.3 billion of remaining authorization for share 
repurchases, with a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program announced on June 
1, 2007. Under the new share repurchase program, there is no expiration date or 
other restriction limiting the period over which we can make our share 
repurchases under the new program, which will expire only when and if we have 
repurchased $15.0 billion of our shares under the program. Under the new 
program, repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to unissued 
status. We consider several factors in determining when to execute the share 
repurchases, including among other things, our current cash needs, our capacity

Page 112 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
for leverage, our cost of borrowings and the market price of our common stock. 
At January 31, 2009, approximately $5.0 billion remained of the $15.0 billion 
authorization. As a result of the economic environment and instability of the 
credit markets, we suspended our share repurchase program in October 2008. We 
reinstituted our share repurchase program in February 2009 and will continue to 
monitor market conditions in connection with our program. 
Common Stock Dividends 
We paid dividends of $0.95 per share in fiscal 2009, representing an 8.0% 
increase over fiscal 2008. The fiscal 2008 dividend of $0.88 per share 
represented a 31.3% increase over fiscal 2007. We have increased our dividend 
every year since the first dividend was declared in March 1974. 
On March 5, 2009, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase in the 
annual dividends for fiscal 2010 to $1.09 per share, an increase of 15% over the 
dividends paid in fiscal 2009. The annual dividend will be paid in four 
quarterly installments on April 6, 2009, June 1, 2009, September 8, 2009, and 
January 4, 2010 to holders of record on March 13, May 15, August 14 and December 
11, 2009, respectively.

Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts such as firm commitments 
for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital 
expenditures, software acquisition/license commitments and legally binding 
service contracts. Purchase orders for the purchase of inventory and other 
services are not included in the table above. Purchase orders represent 
authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. For the purposes of 
this table, contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are 
defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify 
all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; 
fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the 
transaction. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and 
are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into 
contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these 
contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses 
allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 
The expected timing for payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated

Page 114 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid with 
respect to some unrecorded contractual commitments may be different depending on 
the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for 
some obligations. 
In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $1.0 billion of 
unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with 
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for 
Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"), the timing of which is uncertain. FIN 
48, which was adopted in fiscal year 2008, set out criteria for the use of 
judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. 
Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
discussion on unrecognized tax benefits. 
11 
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
In addition to the unrecorded contractual obligations discussed and presented 
above, the Company has made certain guarantees as discussed below for which the 
timing of payment, if any , is unknown. 
In connection with certain debt financing, we could be liable for early 
termination payments if certain unlikely events were to occur. At January 31, 
2009, the aggregate termination payment would have been $153 million. The two 
arrangements pursuant to which these payments could be made expire in fiscal 
2011 and fiscal 2019. 
In connection with the development of our grocery distribution network in the 
United States, we have agreements with third parties which would require us to 
purchase or assume the leases on certain unique equipment in the event the 
agreements are terminated. These agreements, which can be terminated by either 
party at will, cover up to a five-year period and obligate the Company to pay up 
to approximately $66 million upon termination of some or all of these 
agreements. 
The Company has potential future lease commitments for land and buildings for 
approximately 321 future locations. These lease commitments have lease terms 
ranging from 1 to 35 years and provide for certain minimum rentals. If executed, 
payments under operating leases would increase by $72 million for fiscal 2010, 
based on current cost estimates. 
Capital Resources 
During fiscal 2009, we issued $6.6 billion of long-term debt. The net proceeds 
from the issuance of such long-term debt were used to repay outstanding 
commercial paper indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.

Page 115 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Management believes that cash flows from continuing operations and proceeds from 
the sale of commercial paper will be sufficient to finance seasonal buildups in 
merchandise inventories and meet other cash requirements. If our operating cash 
flows are not sufficient to pay dividends and to fund our capital expenditures, 
we anticipate funding any shortfall in these expenditures with a combination of 
commercial paper and long-term debt. We plan to refinance existing long-term 
debt as it matures and may desire to obtain additional long-term financing for 
other corporate purposes. We anticipate no difficulty in obtaining long-term 
financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt 
market in the recent past. The following table details the ratings of the credit 
rating agencies that rated our outstanding indebtedness at January 31, 2009. 
The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our 
commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or 
withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be 
evaluated independently of any other rating.

To monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we 
consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. We monitor the ratio of 
our debt to our total capitalization as support for our long-term financing 
decisions. At January 31, 2009 and January 31, 2008, the ratio of our debt to 
total capitalization was 39.3% and 40.9%, respectively. For the purpose of this 
calculation, debt is defined as the sum of commercial paper, long-term debt due 
within one year, obligations under capital leases due in one year, long-term 
debt and long-term obligations under capital leases. Total capitalization is 
defined as debt plus shareholders' equity. Our ratio of debt to our total 
capitalization decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to decreased borrowing 
levels. 
We also use the ratio of adjusted cash flow from continuing operations to 
adjusted average debt as another metric to review leverage. 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ]

Page 116 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Adjusted cash flow from continuing operations as the numerator is defined as 
cash flow from operations of continuing operations for the current year plus 
two-thirds of the current year operating rent expense less current year 
capitalized interest expense. Adjusted average debt as the denominator is 
defined as average debt plus eight times average operating rent expense. Average 
debt is the simple average of beginning and ending commercial paper, long-term 
debt due within one year, obligations under capital leases due in one year, 
long-term debt and long-term obligations under capital leases. Average operating 
rent expense is the simple average of current year and prior year operating rent 
expense. We believe this metric is useful to investors as it provides them with 
a tool to measure our leverage. This metric was 43% for fiscal 2009 and 40% for 
fiscal 2008. The increase in the metric is primarily due to the increase in net 
cash flow from continuing operations. 
The ratio of adjusted cash flow to adjusted average debt is considered a 
non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC's rules. The most recognized directly 
comparable GAAP measure is the ratio of cash flow from operations of continuing 
operations for the current year to average total debt (which excludes any effect 
of operating leases or capitalized interest), which was 53% for fiscal 2009 and 
49% for fiscal 2008. 
12 
A detailed calculation of the adjusted cash flow from continuing operations to 
adjusted average debt is set forth below along with a reconciliation to the 
corresponding measurement calculated in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

Future Expansion 
We expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $12.5 billion to $13.5 
billion in fiscal 2010. We plan to finance this expansion and any acquisitions 
of other operations that we may make during fiscal 2010 primarily out of cash 
flows from operations. 
13 
Fiscal 2010 capital expenditures will include the addition of the following new, 
relocated and expanded units:

Market Risk 
In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain 
market risks, including changes in interest rates and changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates. 
The analysis presented for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is 
based on a 10% change in interest or foreign currency exchange rates. These 
changes are hypothetical scenarios used to calibrate potential risk and do not 
represent our view of future market changes. As the hypothetical figures 
discussed below indicate, changes in fair value based on the assumed change in 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ]

Page 123 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
rates generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in 
assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. The effect of a 
variation in a particular assumption is calculated without changing any other 
assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, 
which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities. 
At January 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $37.2 billion and $35.7 billion, 
respectively, of long-term debt outstanding. Our weighted average effective 
interest rate on long-term debt, after considering the effect of interest rate 
swaps, was 4.4% and 4.8% at January 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A 
hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates in effect at January 31, 2009 and 
2008, would have increased annual interest expense on borrowings outstanding at 
those dates by $16 million and $25 million, respectively. 
At January 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $1.5 billion and $5.0 billion of 
outstanding commercial paper obligations. The weighted average interest rate, 
including fees, on these obligations at January 31, 2009 and 2008, was 0.9% and 
4.0%, respectively. A hypothetical 10% increase in commercial paper rates in 
effect at January 31, 2009 and 2008, would have increased annual interest 
expense on the outstanding balances on those dates by $1 million and $20 
million, respectively. 
14 
We enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the risks and costs associated 
with financing activities, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed 
and floating-rate debt. Our preference is to maintain between 40% and 50% of our 
debt portfolio, including interest rate swaps, in floating-rate debt. The swap 
agreements are contracts to exchange fixed- or variable-rates for variable- or 
fixed-interest rate payments periodically over the life of the instruments. The 
aggregate fair value of these swaps represented a gain of $304 million at 
January 31, 2009 and a gain of $265 million at January 31, 2008. A hypothetical 
increase or decrease of 10% in interest rates from the level in effect at 
January 31, 2009, would have resulted in a loss or gain in value of the swaps of 
$17 million. A hypothetical increase (or decrease) of 10% in interest rates from 
the level in effect at January 31, 2008, would have resulted in a (loss) or gain 
in value of the swaps of ($45 million) or $46 million, respectively. 
We hold currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency exchange component of our 
net investments in the United Kingdom. The aggregate fair value of these swaps 
at January 31, 2009 and 2008 represented a gain of $526 million and a loss of 
$75 million, respectively. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the 
foreign currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate 
would have resulted in a loss or gain in the value of the swaps of $150 million 
at January 31, 2009. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the foreign 
currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate would have 
resulted in a loss or gain in the value of the swaps of $182 million at January 
31, 2008. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps 
from the market rates in effect at January 31, 2009 and 2008, would have an 
insignificant impact on the value of the swaps.

Page 124 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
In addition to currency swaps, we have designated debt of approximately GBP3.0 
billion as of January 31, 2009 and 2008, as a hedge of our net investment in the 
United Kingdom. At January 31, 2009, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in 
value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have resulted in a 
gain or loss in the value of the debt of $440 million. At January 31, 2008, a 
hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in value of the U.S. dollar relative to 
the British pound would have resulted in a gain or loss in the value of the debt 
of $601 million. In addition, we have designated debt of approximately JPY437.4 
and JPY142.1 billion as of January 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as a hedge 
of our net investment in Japan. At January 31, 2009, a hypothetical 10% increase 
or decrease in value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen would have 
resulted in a gain or loss in the value of the debt of $443 million. At January 
31, 2008, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in value of the U.S. dollar 
relative to the Japanese yen would have resulted in a gain or loss in the value 
of the debt of $216 million. 
Summary of Critical Accounting Policies 
Management strives to report the financial results of the Company in a clear and 
understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules 
are complex and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing our 
Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States. These principles require us to make certain 
estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of 
operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and 
estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual 
results may differ from our estimates. 
Management continually reviews its accounting policies, how they are applied and 
how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a 
summary of our more significant accounting policies and how they are applied in 
preparation of the financial statements. 
Inventories 
We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily 
by the retail method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method 
for substantially all our 
Walmart U.S. segment's merchandise. Sam's Club 
merchandise and merchandise in our distribution warehouses are valued based on 
weighted average cost using the LIFO method. Inventories for international 
operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are 
stated using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. 
Under the retail method, inventory is stated at cost, which is determined by 
applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's retail value. The 
FIFO cost-to-retail ratio is based on the initial margin of beginning inventory 
plus the fiscal year purchase activity. The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring 
any LIFO reserves is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase 
activity less the impact of any markdowns. The retail method requires management 
to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending 
inventory valuation at cost as well as the amount of gross profit recognized. 
Judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell through inventory and

Page 125 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
shrinkage. When management determines the salability of inventory has 
diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are 
recorded at the time the price change decision is made. Factors considered in 
the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer 
preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends. 
Changes in weather patterns and customer preferences related to fashion trends 
could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to 
year. 
When necessary, the Company records a LIFO provision for a quarter for the 
estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual 
results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on 
inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. At 
January 31, 2009 and 2008, our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those 
inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. 
The Company provides for estimated inventory losses ("shrinkage") between 
physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision 
is adjusted annually to reflect the historical trend of the actual physical 
inventory count results. 
Impairment of Assets 
We evaluate long-lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite 
lives for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments 
regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions 
and our operational performance, such as operating income and cash flows. The 
evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of 
identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level or, in 
certain circumstances, at the market group level. The variability of these 
factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future 
events and changes in demographics. Thus our accounting estimates may change 
from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that 
impairment indicators exist and require that impairment tests be performed, 
which could result in management determining that the value of long-lived assets 
is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the long-lived assets. 
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not 
amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be 
impaired. This evaluation requires management to make judgments relating to 
future cash flows, growth rates, and economic and market conditions. These 
evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset 
using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, 
market-based approach. Historically, the Company has generated sufficient 
returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired 
intangible assets. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if 
different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be 
materially impacted. 
15

Income Taxes 
The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant 
judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and 
amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining 
uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in 
our financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not 
probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, 
from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these 
probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 
We account for uncertain tax positions under the provisions of Financial 
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in 
Income Taxes" which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the 
timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. 
Self-Insurance 
We use a combination of insurance, self-insured retention and self-insurance for 
a number of risks, including, without limitation, workers' compensation, general 
liability, vehicle liability, and the Company's obligation for employee-related 
health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are 
estimated by considering historical claims experience, including frequency, 
severity, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions. In calculating 
our liability, we analyze our historical trends, including loss development, and 
apply appropriate loss development factors to the incurred costs associated with 
the claims made against our self-insured program. The estimated accruals for 
these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss 
development differ from these assumptions. For example, for our workers' 
compensation and general liability, a 1% increase or decrease to the assumptions 
for claims costs or loss development factors would increase or decrease our 
self-insurance accrual by $25 million. 
During the last few years, we have enhanced how we manage our workers' 
compensation and general liability claims. As a result, our loss experience with 
respect to such claims has improved and the actuarially determined ultimate loss 
estimates, primarily for claims from fiscal 2004 through 2007, were reduced 
during the quarter ended July 31, 2007. The reductions in ultimate loss 
estimates resulted primarily from improved claims handling experience, which 
impacts loss development factors and other actuarial assumptions. Due to the 
beneficial change in estimate of our ultimate losses, accrued liabilities for 
general liability and workers' compensation claims were reduced by $196 million 
after tax, resulting in an increase in net income per basic and diluted common 
share of $0.05 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2008. 
For a summary of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 1 to our 
Consolidated Financial Statements that appear after this discussion.

long-term debt as it matures, our anticipated funding of any shortfall in cash 
to pay dividends and make capital expenditures through the sale of commercial 
paper and long-term debt securities, our plan to refinance existing long-term 
debt as it matures, and our ability to sell our long-term securities; and under 
the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources- Future Expansion " with respect to 
the our capital expenditures in fiscal 2010, how we will finance expansion and 
any acquisitions made during fiscal 2010, the anticipated number of new stores 
and clubs to be opened in the United States and internationally and the 
anticipated allocation of capital expenditures in fiscal 2010. These statements 
also include statements in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements 
regarding the effect of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 157, in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements regarding 
the realization of certain deferred tax assets, possible tax treatment and 
effect of the loss recorded in connection with the disposition of our German 
operations in fiscal year 2007, the effect of the resolution of certain tax 
audits, the possible timing and effect of certain tax payments, and the effect 
of certain tax issues on our consolidated financial condition or results of 
operations, in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the 
aggregate amount of the payments to be made in connection with the settlement of 
certain litigation and in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements as to

Page 128 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
the expected lack of material impact on the Company's financial condition or 
results of operations from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 141(R) and No. 160. The letter of our President and Chief 
Executive Officer appearing in this Annual Report includes forward-looking 
statements that relate to our efforts contributing to our efficiency, 
maintaining focus on price leadership, our contribution to sustainability, our 
efforts in responsible sourcing, our plan to create jobs in fiscal 2010, our 
continued efforts at inclusiveness, our making a difference by participating in 
debates and taking actions on certain issues, continued change at Wal-Mart, no 
change occurring in aspects of our culture, and our plan to distance Wal-Mart 
from our competitors and to continue helping our customers save money. 
Forward-looking statements appear elsewhere in this Annual Report: under the 
caption "Now More Than Ever at Walmart U.S. Save money. Live better." and relate 
to management's expectations for remodeling stores in fiscal 2010 and the 
strengthening of our value proposition around the world; and under the caption 
"Now More Than Ever We Make A Difference Around The World" and relate to 
management's expectations that achievement of sustainability goals will make 
Wal-Mart an even more efficient, innovative and competitive organization and 
that Wal-Mart will create tens of thousands of jobs in fiscal 2010. The 
forward-looking statements described above are identified by the use in such 
statements of one or more of the words or phrases "anticipate," "believes," 
"could be realized," "could reduce," "expect," "is not expected," "may become," 
"may continue," "may result," "plan," "will be," "will continue," "will find, " 
"will fully realize," "will maintain," "will make," "will never change," "will 
play," "will strengthen," "would be," "would not impact" and other, similar 
words or phrases. Similarly, descriptions of our objectives, strategies, plans, 
goals or targets are also forward-looking statements. These statements discuss, 
among other things, expected growth, future revenues, future cash flows, future 
capital expenditures, future performance and the anticipation and expectations 
of Wal-Mart and its management as to future occurrences and trends. 
The forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report and that we make 
elsewhere are subject to certain factors, in the United States and 
internationally, that could affect our business operations, financial 
performance, business strategy, plans, goals and objectives. Those factors 
include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions, including the 
current economic crisis and disruption in the financial markets, unemployment 
levels, consumer credit availability, levels of consumer disposable income, 
consumer spending patterns and debt levels, inflation, the cost of the goods we 
sell, labor costs, transportation costs, the cost of diesel fuel, gasoline, 
natural gas and electricity, the cost of healthcare benefits, accident costs, 
our casualty and other insurance costs, information security costs, the cost of 
construction materials, availability of acceptable building sites for new 
stores, clubs and other formats, competitive pressures, accident-related costs, 
weather patterns, catastrophic events, storm and other damage to our stores and 
distribution centers, weather-related closing of stores, availability and 
transport of goods from domestic and foreign suppliers, currency exchange 
fluctuations and volatility, trade restrictions, changes in tariff and freight 
rates, adoption of or changes in tax and other laws and regulations that affect 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
our business, costs of compliance with laws and regulations, the outcome of 
legal proceedings to which we are a party, interest rate fluctuations, changes 
in employment legislation and other capital market, economic and geo-political 
conditions and events, including civil unrest and terrorist attacks. Moreover, 
we typically earn a disproportionate part of our annual operating income in the 
fourth quarter as a result of the seasonal buying patterns. Those buying 
patterns are difficult to forecast with certainty. The foregoing list of factors 
that may affect our performance is not exclusive. Other factors and 
unanticipated events could adversely affect our business operations and

Page 129 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
financial performance. We discuss certain of these matters more fully, as well 
as certain risk factors that may affect our business operations, financial 
condition, results of operations and liquidity in other of our filings with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including our Annual Report on Form 
10-K. We filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 
2009, with the SEC on April 1, 2009. The forward-looking statements described 
above are made based on knowledge of our business and the environment in which 
we operate. However, because of the factors described and listed above, as well 
as other factors, or as a result of changes in facts, assumptions not being 
realized or other circumstance, actual results may materially differ from 
anticipated results described or implied in these forward-looking statements. We 
cannot assure the reader that the results or developments expected or 
anticipated by us will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that 
those results or developments will result in the expected consequences for us or 
affect us, our business or our operations in the way we expect. You are urged to 
consider all of these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in 
evaluating the forward-looking statements and not to place undue reliance on 
such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this 
Annual Report speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no 
obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent 
events or circumstances, except as may be required by applicable law.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 
1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
General 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Wal-Mart," the "Company" or "we") operates retail stores 
in various formats around the world and is committed to saving people money so 
they can live better. We earn the trust of our customers every day by providing 
a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at every day low prices 
("EDLP") while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect, 
integrity and diversity. EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price 
items at a low price every day so that our customers trust that our prices will 
not change under frequent promotional activity. Our fiscal year ends on January 
31. 
Consolidation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Wal-Mart Stores, 
Inc. and its subsidiaries. Significant intercompany transactions have been 
eliminated in consolidation. Investments in which the Company has a 20% to 50% 
voting interest and where the Company exercises significant influence over the 
investee are accounted for using the equity method.

Page 147 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
The Company's operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica, El 
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua and the United 
Kingdom are consolidated using a December 31 fiscal year-end, generally due to 
statutory reporting requirements. There were no significant intervening events 
in January 2009 which materially affected the financial statements. The 
Company's operations in Canada and Puerto Rico are consolidated using a January 
31 fiscal year-end. 
The Company consolidates the accounts of certain variable interest entities 
where it has been determined that 
Wal-Mart is the primary beneficiary of those 
entities' operations. The assets, liabilities and results of operations of these 
entities are not material to the Company. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers investments with a maturity of three months or less when 
purchased to be cash equivalents. The majority of payments due from banks for 
third-party credit card, debit card and electronic benefit transactions ("EBT") 
process within 24-48 hours, except for transactions occurring on a Friday, which 
are generally processed the following Monday. All credit card, debit card and 
EBT transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and 
cash equivalents. Amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as 
cash totaled $2.0 billion and $826 million at January 31, 2009 and 2008, 
respectively. In addition, cash and cash equivalents includes restricted cash 
related to cash collateral holdings from various counterparties as required by 
certain derivative and trust agreements of $577 million at January 31, 2009. 
Receivables 
Accounts receivable consist primarily of receivables from insurance companies 
resulting from our pharmacy sales, receivables from suppliers for marketing or 
incentive programs, receivables from real estate transactions and receivables 
from property insurance claims. Additionally, amounts due from banks for 
customer credit card, debit card and EBT transactions that take in excess of 
seven days to process are classified as accounts receivable. 
Inventories 
The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined 
primarily by the retail method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out 
("LIFO") method for substantially all of the Walmart U.S. segment's merchandise 
inventories. Sam's Club merchandise and merchandise in our distribution 
warehouses are valued based on the weighted average cost using the LIFO method. 
Inventories of foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of 
accounting, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. At January 31, 2009 
and 2008, our inventories valued at LIFO approximate those inventories as if 
they were valued at FIFO. 
Financial Instruments

Page 148 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments for purposes other than 
trading to manage its exposure to interest and foreign exchange rates, as well 
as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating-rate debt. Contract 
terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a 
high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are effective at 
meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge 
accounting. If a derivative instrument is a hedge, depending on the nature of 
the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset 
against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm 
commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income 
until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of an 
instrument's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. 
Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for 
which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are valued at fair value 
with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of 
change.

Capitalized Interest 
Interest costs capitalized on construction projects were $88 million, $150 
million and $182 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
Long-Lived Assets 
Long-lived assets are stated at cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for 
indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at 
the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store 
level or in certain circumstances a market group of stores. Undiscounted cash 
flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the 
asset's useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates 
that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, any potential 
impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset 
group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation 
technique. 
Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets 
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets 
acquired, and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. 
Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as 
determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the 
related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived other acquired intangible assets 
are not amortized; rather they are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever

Page 149 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be 
impaired. Definite-lived other acquired intangible assets are considered 
long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods 
that expected economic benefits will be provided. 
Indefinite-lived other acquired intangible assets are evaluated for impairment 
based on their fair values using valuation techniques which are updated annually 
based on the most recent variables and assumptions. 
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining the fair value of the 
related reporting unit. Fair value is measured based on a discounted cash flow 
method or relative market-based approach. The analyses require significant 
management judgment to evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform 
within projections. Historically, the Company has generated sufficient returns 
to recover the cost of the goodwill. 
Goodwill is recorded on the balance sheet in the operating segments as follows: 
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+-+--+---------

| Total goodwill | | | $15,260 
| | | | $15,879 | | 
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+-+--+--------- 
+-+-+--+---------+-+ 
The decrease in the International segment's goodwill since January 31, 2008, 
primarily resulted from strengthening of the U.S. dollar against all major 
currencies except the Japanese yen and an adjustment to allocate $192 million of 
goodwill for the sale of Gazeley, an ASDA commercial property development 
subsidiary in the United Kingdom, partially offset by goodwill recorded in 
connection with the acquisition of a majority interest in Distribución y 
Servicio D&S S.A. ("D&S") in fiscal 2009. 
Leases 
The Company estimates the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of 
renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the 
abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the 
exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company. This expected

Page 150 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
term is used in the determination of whether a store lease is a capital or 
operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. 
Additionally, the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the 
expected lease term or the economic life of the asset. If significant 
expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a 
lease and renewal is reasonably assumed, the useful life of the leasehold 
improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the 
asset, whichever is shorter. 
Rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum 
lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determining 
straight-line rent expense for operating leases. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The assets and liabilities of all foreign subsidiaries are translated using 
exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The income statements of foreign 
subsidiaries are translated using average exchange rates for the period. Related 
translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other 
comprehensive income. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company recognizes sales revenue net of sales taxes and estimated sales 
returns at the time it sells merchandise to the customer. Customer purchases of 
shopping cards are not recognized as revenue until the card is redeemed and the 
customer purchases merchandise by using the shopping card. The Company also 
recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as net sales. 
23 
Sam's Club Membership Fee Revenue Recognition 
The Company recognizes Sam's Club membership fee revenue both in the United 
States and internationally over the term of the membership, which is 12 months. 
The following table details deferred revenue, membership fees received from 
members and the amount of revenue recognized in earnings for each of the fiscal 
years 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Sam's Club membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in 
the revenues section of the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Cost of Sales

Page 152 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the 
Company's warehouses, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of 
transportation from the Company's warehouses to the stores and clubs and the 
cost of warehousing for our Sam's Club segment. 
Payments from Suppliers 
Wal-Mart receives money from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume 
incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such 
as markdowns, margin protection and advertising. Substantially all payments from 
suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of purchases and recognized in our 
Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold. 
Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating 
costs of the Company except those costs related to the transportation of 
products from the supplier to the warehouses, stores or clubs, the costs related 
to the transportation of products from the warehouses to the stores or clubs and 
the cost of warehousing for our Sam's Club segment. As a result, the cost of 
warehousing and occupancy for our Walmart U.S. and International segments' 
distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and 
administrative expenses. Because we do not include the cost of our Walmart U.S. 
and International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, our gross 
profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales (our "gross profit margin") 
may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs 
related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation 
of gross profit. 
Advertising Costs 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $2.3 billion, $2.0 billion 
and $1.9 billion in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Advertising costs 
consist primarily of print and television advertisements. 
Pre-Opening Costs 
The costs of start-up activities, including organization costs, related to new 
store openings, store remodels, expansions and relocations are expensed as 
incurred. 
Share-Based Compensation 
The Company recognizes expense for its share-based compensation based on the 
fair value of the awards that are granted. The fair value of stock options is 
estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation 
model which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of exchange 
traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. 
Option valuation methods require the input of highly subjective assumptions, 
including the expected stock price volatility. Measured compensation cost, net 
of estimated forfeitures, is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the 
related share-based compensation award.

Page 153 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Share-based compensation awards that may be settled in cash are accounted for as 
liabilities and marked to market each period. Measured compensation cost for 
performance-based awards is recognized only if it is probable that the 
performance condition will be achieved. 
Insurance/Self-Insurance 
The Company uses a combination of insurance, self-insured retention and 
self-insurance for a number of risks, including, without limitation, workers' 
compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property and the Company's 
obligation for employee-related health care benefits. Liabilities associated 
with these risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience, 
demographic factors, frequency and severity factors and other actuarial 
assumptions. In estimating our liability for such claims, we periodically 
analyze our historical trends, including loss development, and apply appropriate 
loss development factors to the incurred costs associated with the claims. 
During the last few years, we have enhanced how we manage our workers' 
compensation and general liability claims. As a result, our loss experience with 
respect to such claims has improved and the actuarially determined ultimate loss 
estimates, primarily for claims from fiscal 2004 through 2007, were reduced 
during the quarter ended July 31, 2007. The reductions in ultimate loss 
estimates resulted primarily from improved claims handling experience, which 
impacts loss development factors and other actuarial assumptions. Due to the 
beneficial change in estimate of our ultimate losses, accrued liabilities for 
general liability and workers' compensation claims were reduced by $196 million 
after tax, resulting in an increase in net income per basic and diluted common 
share of $0.05 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2008. 
24 
Depreciation and Amortization 
Depreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes are provided on 
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various assets. 
Depreciation expense, including amortization of property under capital leases, 
for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $6.7 billion, $6.3 billion and $5.5 
billion, respectively. For income tax purposes, accelerated methods of 
depreciation are used with recognition of deferred income taxes for the 
resulting temporary differences. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the 
shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected 
lease term. Estimated useful lives for financial statement purposes are as 
follows: 
+------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------- 
---------+ 
| Buildings and improvements | 5-50 
years |

Page 154 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
+------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------- 
---------+ 
| Fixtures and equipment | 3-20 
years | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------- 
---------+ 
| Transportation equipment | 4-15 
years | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------- 
---------+ 
Income Taxes 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax 
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement 
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax 
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates 
in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be 
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a 
change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce 
deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized. 
The Company accounts for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with Financial 
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for 
Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"), which was adopted in fiscal year 2008 
and discussed further in Note 5. 
Accrued Liabilities

| | | | $15,725 | | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------+-+--+--------- 
+--+--+--+---------+-+ 
Net Income Per Common Share 
Basic net income per common share is based on the weighted-average number of 
outstanding common shares. Diluted net income per common share is based on the 
weighted-average number of outstanding shares adjusted for the dilutive effect 
of stock options and other share-based awards. The dilutive effect of stock 
options and other share-based awards was 12 million, 6 million and 4 million 
shares in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company had 
approximately 6 million, 62 million and 62 million option shares outstanding at 
January 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which were not included in the 
diluted net income per share calculation because their effect would be 
antidilutive. 
Estimates and Assumptions 
The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates 
and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities. They also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual 
results may differ from those estimates. 
Reclassifications 
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current 
presentations.

Short-term borrowings consisted of $1.5 billion and $5.0 billion of commercial 
paper at January 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company has certain lines 
of credit totaling $10.2 billion, most of which were undrawn as of January 31, 
2009. Of the $10.2 billion in lines of credit, $9.7 billion is committed with 29 
financial institutions. In conjunction with these lines of credit, the Company 
has agreed to observe certain covenants, the most restrictive of which relates 
to maximum amounts of secured debt and long-term leases. Committed lines of 
credit are primarily used to support commercial paper. The portion of committed 
lines of credit used to support commercial paper remained undrawn as of January 
31, 2009. The committed lines of credit mature at varying times starting between 
June 2009 and June 2012, carry interest rates of LIBOR plus 11 to 15 basis 
points and at prime plus zero to 50 basis points, and incur commitment fees of 
1.5 to 7.5 basis points on undrawn amounts. 
The Company had trade letters of credit outstanding totaling $2.4 billion and 
$2.7 billion at January 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At January 31, 2009 and 
2008, the Company had standby letters of credit outstanding totaling $2.0 and 
$2.2 billion, respectively. These letters of credit were issued primarily for 
the purchase of inventory and self-insurance purposes.

reset securities in the amount of $500 million is structured to be remarketed in 
connection with the annual reset of the interest rate. If, for any reason, the 
remarketing of the notes does not occur at the time of any interest rate reset, 
the holders of the notes must sell, and the Company must repurchase, the notes 
at par. All of these issuances have been classified as long-term debt due within 
one year in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

3 Financial Instruments 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging and non-trading 
purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and foreign exchange 
rates. Use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the 
Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. Market risk 
represents the possibility that the value of the derivative instrument will 
change. In a hedging relationship, the change in the value of the derivative is 
offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged 
item. Credit risk related to derivatives represents the possibility that the

Page 161 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract. The notional, or 
contractual, amount of the Company's derivative financial instruments is used to 
measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the Company's 
exposure due to credit risk. Credit risk is monitored through established 
approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, 
reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral (generally cash) when 
appropriate. The majority of the Company's transactions are with counterparties 
rated "AA-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. In 
connection with various derivative agreements with counterparties, the Company 
is holding $440 million in cash collateral from these counterparties at January 
31, 2009. 
Fair Value Instruments 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments for purposes other than 
trading to manage its exposure to interest and foreign exchange rates, as well 
as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating-rate debt. Contract 
terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a 
high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are effective at 
meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge 
accounting. If a derivative instrument is a hedge, depending on the nature of 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset 
against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm 
commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income 
until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of an 
instrument's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. 
Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for 
which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are valued at fair value 
with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of 
change. 
Net Investment Instruments 
At January 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company is party to cross-currency interest 
rate swaps that hedge its net investment in the United Kingdom. The agreements 
are contracts to exchange fixed-rate payments in one currency for fixed-rate 
payments in another currency. 
The Company has approximately GBP3.0 billion of outstanding debt that is 
designated as a hedge of the Company's net investment in the United Kingdom as 
of January 31, 2009 and 2008. The Company also has outstanding approximately 
JPY437.4 and JPY142.1 billion of debt that is designated as a hedge of the 
Company's net investment in Japan at January 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
All changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in accumulated 
other comprehensive income, offsetting the foreign currency translation 
adjustment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
Cash Flow Instruments 
The Company is party to receive floating-rate, pay fixed-rate interest rate 
swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of certain foreign-denominated debt. The 
swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of interest expense risk. The agreement

Page 162 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
is a contract to exchange fixed-rate payments of interest for floating-rate 
payments of interest. Changes in the foreign benchmark interest rate result in 
reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income to 
earnings to offset the floating-rate interest expense. 
27 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
("SFAS") No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 defines fair 
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value within generally 
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and expands required disclosures about 
fair value measurements. In November 2007, the FASB provided a one year deferral 
for the implementation of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The 
Company adopted SFAS 157 as of February 1, 2008, as required. The adoption of 
SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and 
results of operations. Effective February 1, 2009, the Company adopted SFAS 157 
for its nonfinancial assets and liabilities and does not anticipate a material 
impact to its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the 
inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as 
observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as 
inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or 
indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which 
little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its 
own assumptions. As of January 31, 2009, the Company held certain derivative 
asset and liability positions that are required to be measured at fair value on 
a recurring basis. The majority of the Company's derivative instruments related 
to interest rate swaps. The fair values of these interest rate swaps have been 
measured in accordance with Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. 
Hedging instruments with an unrealized gain are recorded on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets in other current assets or other assets and deferred charges, 
based on maturity date. Those instruments with an unrealized loss are recorded 
in accrued liabilities or deferred income taxes and other, based on maturity 
date. 
Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount approximates fair value due to 
the short maturity of these instruments. 
Long-term debt: Fair value is based on the Company's current incremental 
borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements or, where applicable, 
quoted market prices. 
Derivative financial instruments designated for hedging: The fair values are

estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements 
as of the reporting dates. As of January 31, 2009 and 2008, derivative financial 
instruments designated for hedging are as follows (asset/(liability)):

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an amendment of FASB 
Statement No. 115" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 permits companies to measure many 
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified 
election dates. The Company adopted SFAS 159 on February 1, 2008. Since the 
Company has not utilized the fair value option for any allowable items, the 
adoption of SFAS 159 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial 
condition and results of operations.

4 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 
Comprehensive income is net income plus certain other items that are recorded 
directly to shareholders' equity. Amounts included in accumulated other 
comprehensive income for the Company's derivative instruments and minimum 
pension liabilities are recorded net of the related income tax effects. The 
following table gives further detail regarding changes in the composition of 
accumulated other comprehensive income during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007:

The foreign currency translation amount includes a net translation gain of $1.2 
billion, a loss of $9 million, and a gain of $143 million at January 31, 2009, 
2008 and 2007, respectively, related to net investment hedges of our operations 
in the United Kingdom and Japan. 
In conjunction with the disposition of our operations in South Korea and 
Germany, the Company reclassified $603 million from foreign currency translation 
amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income into discontinued 
operations within our Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal year 2007. 
Accumulated other comprehensive income for fiscal 2009 was adversely affected by 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Unremitted Earnings

Page 171 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
United States income taxes have not been provided on accumulated but 
undistributed earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately $12.7 
billion and $10.7 billion as of January 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as the 
Company intends to permanently reinvest these amounts. However, if any portion 
were to be distributed, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by foreign 
income taxes paid on those earnings. Determination of the unrecognized deferred 
tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable because 
of the complexities of its hypothetical calculation. 
Losses and Valuation Allowances 
At January 21, 2009, the Company had international net operating loss and 
capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately $4.1 billion. Of these 
carryforwards, $2.4 billion will expire in various years through 2016. The 
remaining carryforwards have no expiration. 
As of January 31, 2009, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of 
approximately $1.9 billion on deferred tax assets associated primarily with net 
operating loss and capital loss carryforwards from our international operations 
for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred 
tax asset will not be realized. The $263 million net change in the valuation 
allowance in fiscal 2009 related to releases arising from the use of net 
operating loss carryforwards, increases in foreign net operating losses arising 
in fiscal 2009 and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Management 
believes that it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
remaining domestic and international deferred tax assets. 
During fiscal 2007, the Company recorded a pretax loss of $918 million and 
recognized a tax benefit of $126 million on the disposition of its German 
operations. The Company recorded an additional loss on this disposition of $153 
million during fiscal year 2008. See Note 6, Acquisitions and Disposals, for 
additional information about this transaction. The Company has claimed the tax 
loss realized on the disposition of its German operations as an ordinary 
worthless stock deduction. The Internal Revenue Service has challenged the 
characterization of this deduction. If the loss is characterized as a capital 
loss, any such capital loss could only be realized by being offset against 
future capital gains and would expire in 2012. Any deferred tax asset, net of 
its related valuation allowance, resulting from the characterization of the loss 
as capital may be included with the Company's non-current assets of discontinued 
operations. Final resolution of the amount and character of the deduction may 
result in the recognition of additional tax benefits of up to $1.7 billion which 
may be included in discontinued operations in future periods. 
FASB Interpretation No. 48 
The Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board 
Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," ("FIN 48") 
effective February 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by 
prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet 
before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides 
guidance on de-recognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties,

Page 172 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As a result of the 
implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized a $236 million increase in the 
liability for unrecognized tax benefits relating to continuing operations and a 
$28 million increase in the related liability for interest and penalties for a 
total of $264 million. Of this amount, $160 million was accounted for as a 
reduction to the February 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings, $70 million as 
an increase to non-current deferred tax assets, and $34 million as an increase 
to current deferred tax assets. 
The Company classifies interest on uncertain tax benefits as interest expense 
and income tax penalties as operating, selling, general and administrative 
expenses. At February 1, 2007, before any tax benefits, the Company had $177 
million of accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. 
31 
In the normal course of business, the Company provides for uncertain tax 
positions and the related interest and adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits and 
accrued interest accordingly. Unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing 
operations increased by $149 million and $89 million for fiscal 2009 and 2008, 
respectively. Accrued interest increased by $47 million and $65 million for 
fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. Penalties decreased by $12 million for 
fiscal 2009. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax 
audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by $150 million to $230 
million, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the 
Company agrees to their disallowance. Such unrecognized taxed benefits relate 
primarily to timing recognition issues. 
A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as 
follows:

The amount, if recognized, which is included in the balance at January 31, 2009, 
that would affect the Company's effective tax rate is $582 million. The 
difference represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for which the 
ultimate tax consequence is certain, but for which there is uncertainty about 
the timing of the tax consequence recognition. Because of the impact of 
deferred tax accounting, the timing would not impact the annual effective tax 
rate but could accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an 
earlier period. 
As of February 1, 2007, and at January 31, 2009, the Company had unrecognized 
tax benefits of $1.7 billion which are related to a worthless stock deduction 
the Company has claimed on its disposition of its German operations in the 
second quarter of fiscal 2007, as mentioned above. Of this, $63 million was 
recognized in discontinued operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2009

Page 174 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
following the resolution of a gain determination on a discontinued operation 
that was sold in fiscal 2004. The remaining balance, when settled, will be 
recorded as discontinued operations. The Company cannot predict the ultimate 
outcome of this matter, nor can it predict with reasonable certainty if it will 
be resolved within the next twelve months. 
The Company is subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income 
taxes generally for the fiscal years 2008 and 2009, with fiscal years 2004 
through 2007 remaining open for a limited number of issues, for non-U.S. income 
taxes for the tax years 2003 through 2009, and for state and local income taxes 
for the fiscal years generally 2004 through 2008 and from 1998 for a limited 
number of issues. 
Non-Income Taxes 
Additionally, the Company is subject to tax examinations for payroll, value 
added, sales-based and other taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing 
and, in certain cases, have resulted in assessments from the taxing authorities. 
Where appropriate, the Company has made accruals for these matters which are 
reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. While these 
matters are individually immaterial, a group of related matters, if decided 
adversely to the Company, may result in liability material to the Company's 
financial condition or results of operations. 
6 Acquisitions, Investments and Disposals 
Acquisitions and Investments 
In February 2007, the Company announced the purchase of a 35% interest in BCL. 
BCL operates 101 hypermarkets in 34 cities in China under the Trust-Mart banner. 
The purchase price for the 35% interest was $264 million. As additional 
consideration, the Company paid $376 million to extinguish a loan issued to the 
selling BCL shareholders that is secured by the pledge of the remaining equity 
of BCL. Concurrent with its initial investment in BCL, the Company entered into 
a stockholders agreement which provides the Company with voting rights 
associated with a portion of the common stock of BCL securing the loan, 
amounting to an additional 30% of the aggregate outstanding shares. Pursuant to 
the purchase agreement, the Company is committed to purchase the remaining 
interest in BCL on or before February 2010 subject to certain conditions. The 
final purchase price for the remaining interest will be approximately $320 
million, net of loan repayments and subject to reduction under certain 
circumstances. 
After closing the acquisition, the Company began consolidating BCL using a 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
December 31 fiscal year-end. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income 
for fiscal 2008 include the results of BCL for the period commencing upon the 
acquisition of the Company's interest in BCL and ending December 31, 2007. 
BCL's results of operations were not material to the Company in fiscal 2008. 
Assets recorded in the acquisition were approximately $1.6 billion, including 
approximately $1.1 billion in goodwill, and liabilities assumed were 
approximately $1.0 billion.

32 
In August 2007, the Company announced an agreement between 
Wal-Mart and Bharti 
Enterprises, an Indian company, to establish a joint venture called Bharti 
Wal-Mart Private Limited to conduct wholesale cash-and-carry and back-end supply 
chain management operations in India, in compliance with Government of India 
guidelines. The first wholesale facility is targeted to open in mid-fiscal 2010. 
The joint venture was formed to establish wholesale warehouse facilities to 
serve retailers and business owners by selling them merchandise at wholesale 
prices, including Bharti Retail, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bharti 
Enterprises, that is developing a chain of retail stores in India. In addition, 
Bharti Retail has entered into a franchise agreement with an Indian subsidiary 
of Wal-Mart under which it will provide technical support to Bharti Retail's 
retail business. 
In October 2007, the Company announced the launch of a tender offer to acquire 
the remaining outstanding common and preferred shares of our Japanese 
subsidiary, The Seiyu Ltd. ("Seiyu"). Prior to the offer, the Company owned 
50.9% of Seiyu. The tender offer commenced on October 23, expired on December 4, 
and closed on December 11, 2007. At closing, the Company acquired the majority 
of the common shares and all minority preferred shares. The Company purchased 
the remaining minority common shares in fiscal 2009 and now owns all of the 
common and preferred shares of Seiyu. Total purchase price for the tendered 
shares was $937 million, including transaction costs. This acquisition of the 
remaining Seiyu shares not owned by the Company resulted in the recording of 
$775 million of goodwill and the elimination of $299 million minority interest 
related to the preferred shareholders. 
In January 2009, the Company completed a tender offer for the shares of 
Distribución y Servicio D&S S.A. ("D&S"), acquiring approximately 58.2% of the 
outstanding D&S shares (the "First Offer"). D&S has 197 stores, 10 shopping 
centers and 85 PRESTO financial services branches throughout Chile. The purchase 
price for the D&S shares in the First Offer was approximately $1.55 billion. As 
of January 31, 2009, assets recorded in the acquisition after the First Offer, 
were approximately $3.6 billion, including approximately $1.0 billion in 
goodwill, liabilities assumed were approximately $1.7 billion and minority 
interest was approximately $395 million. Under the Chilean securities laws, the 
Company was required after the First Offer to initiate a second tender offer 
(the "Second Offer") for the remaining outstanding shares of D&S on the same 
terms as the First Offer. The Company completed the Second Offer in March 2009, 
acquiring approximately 16.4% of the outstanding D&S shares for approximately 
$430 million, resulting in the Company owning approximately 74.6% of the D&S 
shares. In connection with the transaction, the former D&S controlling 
shareholders were each granted a put option that is exercisable beginning in 
January 2011 through January 2016. During the exercise period, the put option 
allows each former controlling shareholder the right to require the Company to 
purchase up to all of their shares of D&S (approximately 25.1%) owned following 
the Second Offer at fair market value at the time of an exercise, if any. The 
consolidated financial statements of D&S, as well as the allocation of the 
purchase price as of January 31, 2009, are preliminary.

Disposals 
During fiscal 2007, the Company disposed of its operations in South Korea and 
Germany, which had been included in our International segment. Consequently, the 
net losses and cash flows related to these operations are presented as 
discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income and our 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the appropriate periods presented. 
The Company recorded a pretax gain on the sale of its retail business in South 
Korea of $103 million, and tax expense of $63 million during fiscal 2007. In 
determining the gain on the disposition of our South Korean operations, the 
Company allocated $206 million of goodwill from the International reporting 
unit. 
The Company recorded a loss of $918 million on the disposal of its German 
operations during fiscal 2007. In addition, the Company recognized a tax benefit 
of $126 million related to this transaction in fiscal 2007. The Company recorded 
a charge of $153 million in fiscal 2008 to discontinued operations related to 
the settlement of a post-closing adjustment and certain other indemnification 
obligations. 
During fiscal 2009, the Company disposed of Gazeley, an ASDA commercial property 
development subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Consequently, the results of 
operations associated with Gazeley are presented as discontinued operations in 
our Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets for all 
periods presented. The cash flows related to this operation were insignificant 
for all periods presented. In fiscal 2009, the Company recognized approximately 
$212 million, after tax, in operating profits and gains from the sale of Gazeley 
as discontinued operations. The transaction continues to remain subject to 
certain indemnification obligations. In calculating the gain on disposal, the 
Company allocated $192 million of goodwill from the International segment. 
During fiscal 2009, the Company initiated a restructuring program under which 
the Company's Japanese subsidiary, Seiyu, will close 23 stores and dispose of 
certain excess properties. This restructuring will involve incurring costs 
associated with lease termination obligations, asset impairment charges and 
employee separation benefits. The costs associated with this restructuring are 
presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income 
and Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. The cash flows and 
accrued liabilities related to this restructuring were insignificant for all 
periods presented. The Company recognized approximately $122 million, after 
tax, in restructuring expenses and operating results as discontinued operations 
during fiscal 2009. Additional costs will be recorded in future periods for 
lease termination obligations and employee separation benefits and are not 
expected to be material. 
33

In addition, the Company recorded a $63 million benefit to discontinued 
operations in fiscal 2009, from the successful resolution of a tax contingency 
related to McLane Company, Inc., a former Wal-Mart subsidiary sold in fiscal 
2004. 
In addition to the gain and loss on the dispositions noted above, discontinued 
operations as presented in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income also 
include net sales and net operating income and losses from our discontinued 
operations as follows:

7 Share-Based Compensation Plans 
As of January 31, 2009, the Company has awarded share-based compensation to 
executives and other associates of the Company through various share-based 
compensation plans. The compensation cost recognized for all plans was $302 
million, $276 million and $271 million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, 
respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized for all share-based 
compensation plans was $112 million, $102 million and $101 million for fiscal 
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
The Company's Stock Incentive Plan of 2005 (the "Plan"), which is 
shareholder-approved, was established to grant stock options, restricted 
(non-vested) stock, performance share and other equity compensation awards to 
its associates, and 210 million shares of common stock to be issued under the 
Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company believes 
that such awards better align the interests of its associates with those of its 
shareholders. 
Under the Plan and prior plans, substantially all stock option awards have been 
granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company's stock 
at the date of grant. Generally, outstanding options granted before fiscal 2001 
vest over seven years. Options granted after fiscal 2001 generally vest over

Page 178 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
five years. Shares issued upon the exercise of options are newly issued. Options 
granted generally have a contractual term of 10 years. 
The Company's United Kingdom subsidiary, ASDA, also offers two other stock 
option plans to its colleagues. The first plan, The ASDA Colleague Share 
Ownership Plan 1999 ("CSOP"), grants options to certain colleagues. The initial 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
CSOP grant is a three year and a six year vesting with six year vesting granted 
thereafter. CSOP shares have an exercise period of two months immediately 
following the vesting date. The second plan, The ASDA Sharesave Plan 2000 
("Sharesave"), grants options to certain colleagues at 80% of the average market 
value of the three days preceding date of grant. Sharesave options become 
exercisable after either a three-year or five-year period and generally expire 
six months after becoming exercisable. The CSOP and Sharesave Plan were 
registered to grant stock options to its colleagues for up to a combined 34 
million shares of common stock. 
The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant 
using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model that uses various 
assumptions for inputs, which are noted in the following table. Generally, the 
Company uses expected volatilities and risk-free interest rates that correlate 
with the expected term of the option when estimating an option's fair value. To 
determine the expected life of the option, the Company bases its estimates on 
historical exercise and expiration activity of grants with similar vesting 
periods. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock and 
the expected risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve 
at the time of the grant. The expected dividend yield over the vesting period is 
based on the annual dividend rate at the time of grant. The following table 
represents a weighted-average of the assumptions used by the Company to estimate 
the fair values of the Company's stock options at the grant dates:

As of January 31, 2009, there was $148 million of total unrecognized 
compensation cost related to stock options granted under the Plan, which is 
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. The total 
fair value of options vested during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2009, 
2008 and 2007, was $107 million, $102 million and $160 million, respectively. 
The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the fiscal 
years ended January 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, was $9.97, $11.00 and $9.20,

Page 180 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
respectively. Stock options granted in fiscal 2009 were primarily issued under 
the ASDA Sharesave plan. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 
the years ended January 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, was $173 million, $60 million 
and $103 million, respectively. During fiscal 2009, the Company received $585 
million in cash from the exercise of stock options. 
In fiscal 2007, the Company began issuing restricted stock rights to most 
associates in lieu of stock option awards. Restricted stock rights are 
associate rights to Company stock after a specified service period. Grants 
issued before fiscal 2009 typically vest over five years with 40% vesting three 
years from grant date and the remaining 60% vesting five years from grant date. 
Beginning in fiscal 2009, the vesting schedule was adjusted for new grants to 
50% vesting three years from grant date and the remaining 50% vesting five years 
from grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock right is determined on 
the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend 
yield through the vesting period. Expected dividend yield over the vesting 
period is based on the annual dividend rate at the time of grant. The weighted 
average discount for dividend yield used to determine the fair value of 
restricted stock rights granted in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 was 6.8%, 8.4% 
and 6.9%, respectively.

Under the Plan, the Company grants various types of awards of restricted 
(non-vested) stock to certain associates. These grants include awards for shares 
that vest based on the passage of time, performance criteria, or both. Vesting 
periods vary. The restricted stock awards may be settled in stock, or deferred 
as stock or cash, based upon the associate's election. Consequently, these 
awards are classified as liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
Sheets unless the associate has elected for the award to be settled or deferred 
in stock.

During fiscal 2006, the Company began issuing performance share awards under the 
Plan that vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance 
criteria. Based on the extent to which the targets are achieved, vested shares 
may range from 0% to 150% of the original award amount. Because the performance 
shares issued before January 1, 2008 may be settled in stock or cash, the 
performance shares are accounted for as liabilities in the accompanying 
Consolidated Balance Sheets unless the associate has elected for the award to be 
settled or deferred in stock. Performance shares issued in fiscal 2009 are 
settled or deferred in stock; therefore, they are accounted for as equity in the 
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The fair value of the restricted stock and performance share liabilities are 
re-measured each reporting period. The total liability for restricted stock and 
performance share awards at January 31, 2009 and January 31, 2008, was $126 
million and $125 million, respectively. 
A summary of the Company's non-vested restricted stock and performance share 
award activity for fiscal 2009 presented below represents the maximum number of 
shares that could be earned or vested under the Plan:

As of January 31, 2009, there was $293 million of total unrecognized 
compensation cost related to restricted stock and performance share awards 
granted under the Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a 
weighted-average period of 3.4 years. The total fair value of shares vested 
during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, was $55 million, 
$24 million and $38 million, respectively. 
8 Legal Proceedings 
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. In accordance with 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for 
Contingencies," the Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, 
where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these 
matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is 
in the best interest of the Company's shareholders. The matters, or groups of 
related matters, discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the 
Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in liability material to 
the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
Wage-and-Hour Class Actions: The Company is a defendant in numerous cases 
containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and 
former hourly associates who allege that the Company forced or encouraged them 
to work "off the clock," failed to provide rest breaks or meal periods, or 
otherwise failed to pay them correctly. The complaints generally seek 
unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief, or both. Class or 
collective-action certification has yet to be addressed by the court in a 
majority of these cases. In the majority of wage-and-hour class actions filed 
against the Company in which the courts have addressed the issue, class 
certification has been denied. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the 
possible loss or range of loss that may arise from these lawsuits, except as 
noted below. 
On December 23, 2008, the Company and the attorneys for the plaintiffs in 63 of 
the wage-and-hour class actions described above announced that they had entered 
into a series of settlement agreements in connection with those matters. Each of 
the settlements is subject to approval by the court in which the matter is 
pending. The total amount to be paid by the Company under the settlement 
agreements will depend on whether such approvals are granted, as well as on the 
number and amount of claims that are submitted by class members in each matter. 
If all of the agreements are approved by the courts, the total to be paid by the 
Company under the settlement agreements will be at least $352 million, but no

Page 183 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
more than $640 million, depending on the number and amount of claims. The 
Company may also incur additional administrative expenses and other costs in the 
process of concluding the settlements. 
One of the remaining wage-and-hour lawsuits is Savaglio v. 
Wal-Mart Stores, 
Inc., a class-action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs allege that they were not 
provided meal and rest breaks in accordance with California law, and seek 
monetary damages and injunctive relief. A trial on the plaintiffs' claims for 
monetary damages concluded on December 22, 2005. The jury returned a verdict of 
approximately $57 million in statutory penalties and $115 million in punitive 
damages. In June 2006, the judge entered an order allowing some, but not all, of 
the injunctive relief sought by the plaintiffs. On December 27, 2006, the judge 
entered an order awarding the plaintiffs an additional amount of approximately 
$26 million in costs and attorneys' fees. The Company believes it has 
substantial factual and legal defenses to the claims at issue, and on January 
31, 2007, the Company filed its Notice of Appeal. On November 19, 2008, the 
court of appeals issued an Order staying further proceedings in the Savaglio 
appeal pending the decision of the California Supreme Court in a case involving 
similar issues, entitled Brinker v. Superior Court . 
In another of the remaining wage-and-hour lawsuits, Braun/Hummel v. Wal-Mart 
Stores, Inc., a trial was commenced in September 2006, in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs allege that the Company failed to pay class members 
for all hours worked and prevented class members from taking their full meal and 
rest breaks. On October 13, 2006, the jury awarded back-pay damages to the 
plaintiffs of approximately $78 million on their claims for off-the-clock work 
and missed rest breaks. The jury found in favor of the Company on the 
plaintiffs' meal-period claims. On November 14, 2007, the trial judge entered a 
final judgment in the approximate amount of $188 million, which included the 
jury's back-pay award plus statutory penalties, prejudgment interest and 
attorneys' fees. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal 
defenses to the claims at issue, and on December 7, 2007, the Company filed its 
Notice of Appeal. 
In another wage-and-hour lawsuit, Braun v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., the Company 
agreed in October 2008 to settle the case by paying up to approximately $54 
million, part of which is to be paid to the State of Minnesota and part to the 
class members and their counsel. On January 14, 2009, the trial court entered an 
Order granting preliminary approval of the settlement and directing that notices 
be mailed to class members. The exact amount that will be paid by the Company 
depends on the number and amount of claims that are submitted by class members 
in response to the notices. 
36 
Exempt Status Cases: The Company is currently a defendant in three cases in 
which the plaintiffs seek class certification of various groups of salaried 
managers and challenge their exempt status under state and federal laws. In one 
of those cases ( Sepulveda v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc .), class certification was

Page 184 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
denied by the trial court on May 5, 2006. On April 25, 2008, a three-judge panel 
of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial 
court's ruling in part and reversed it in part, and remanded the case for 
further proceedings. On May 16, 2008, the Company filed a petition seeking 
review of that ruling by a larger panel of the court. On October 10, 2008, the 
court entered an Order staying all proceedings in the Sepulveda appeal pending 
the final disposition of the appeal in Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , 
discussed below. Class certification has not been addressed in the other cases. 
The Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that 
may arise from these lawsuits. 
Gender Discrimination Cases: The Company is a defendant in Dukes v. Wal-Mart 
Stores, Inc., a class-action lawsuit commenced in June 2001 in the United States 
District Court for the Northern District of California. The case was brought on 
behalf of all past and present female employees in all of the Company's retail 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
stores and warehouse clubs in the United States. The complaint alleges that the 
Company has engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in 
promotions, pay, training and job assignments. The complaint seeks, among other 
things, injunctive relief, front pay, back pay, punitive damages and attorneys' 
fees. On June 21, 2004, the district court issued an order granting in part and 
denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The class, which 
was certified by the district court for purposes of liability, injunctive and 
declaratory relief, punitive damages and lost pay, subject to certain 
exceptions, includes all women employed at any 
Wal-Mart domestic retail store at 
any time since December 26, 1998, who have been or may be subjected to the pay 
and management track promotions policies and practices challenged by the 
plaintiffs. 
The Company believes that the district court's ruling is incorrect. On August 
31, 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the 
Company's petition for discretionary review of the ruling. On February 6, 2007, 
a divided three-judge panel of the court of appeals issued a decision affirming 
the district court's certification order. On February 20, 2007, the Company 
filed a petition asking that the decision be reconsidered by a larger panel of 
the court. On December 11, 2007, the three-judge panel withdrew its opinion of 
February 6, 2007, and issued a revised opinion. As a result, the Company's 
Petition for Rehearing En Banc was denied as moot. The Company filed a new 
Petition for Rehearing En Banc on January 8, 2008. On February 13, 2009, the 
court of appeals issued an Order granting the Petition. The court heard oral 
argument on the Petition on March 24, 2009. If the Company is not successful in 
its appeal of class certification, or an appellate court issues a ruling that 
allows for the certification of a class or classes with a different size or 
scope, and if there is a subsequent adverse verdict on the merits from which 
there is no successful appeal, or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the 
litigation, the resulting liability could be material to the Company's financial 
condition or results of operations. The plaintiffs also seek punitive damages 
which, if awarded, could result in the payment of additional amounts material to 
the Company's financial condition or results of operations. However, because of 
the uncertainty of the outcome of the appeal from the district court's 
certification decision, because of the uncertainty of the balance of the 
proceedings contemplated by the district court, and because the Company's 
liability, if any, arising from the litigation, including the size of any 
damages award if plaintiffs are successful in the litigation or any negotiated 
settlement, could vary widely, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the 
possible loss or range of loss that may arise from the litigation.

The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit that was filed by the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") on August 24, 2001, in the United States 
District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky on behalf of Janice Smith 
and all other females who made application or transfer requests at the London, 
Kentucky, distribution center from 1998 to the present, and who were not hired 
or transferred into the warehouse positions for which they applied. The 
complaint alleges that the Company based hiring decisions on gender in violation 
of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act as amended. The EEOC can maintain this 
action as a class without certification. The EEOC seeks back pay and front pay 
for those females not selected for hire or transfer during the relevant time 
period, plus compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief. The EEOC 
has asserted that the hiring practices in question resulted in a shortfall of 
245 positions. The claims for compensatory and punitive damages are capped by 
statute at $300,000 per shortfall position. The amounts of back pay and front 
pay that are being sought have not been specified. The case has been set for 
trial on March 1, 2010. 
Hazardous Materials Investigations: On November 8, 2005, the Company received a 
grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the Central 
District of California, seeking documents and information relating to the 
Company's receipt, transportation, handling, identification, recycling, 
treatment, storage and disposal of certain merchandise that constitutes 
hazardous materials or hazardous waste. The Company has been informed by the 
U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California that it is a 
target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), the Clean Water Act and the Hazardous 
Materials Transportation Statute. This U.S. Attorney's Office contends, among 
other things, that the use of Company trucks to transport certain returned 
merchandise from the Company's stores to its return centers is prohibited by 
RCRA because those materials may be considered hazardous waste. The government 
alleges that, to comply with RCRA, the Company must ship from the store certain 
materials as "hazardous waste" directly to a certified disposal facility using a 
certified hazardous waste carrier. The Company contends that the practice of 
transporting returned merchandise to its return centers for subsequent 
disposition, including disposal by certified facilities, is compliant with 
applicable laws and regulations. While management cannot predict the ultimate 
outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a 
material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
Additionally, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of California 
has initiated its own investigation regarding the Company's handling of 
hazardous materials and hazardous waste and the Company has received 
administrative document requests from the California Department of Toxic 
Substances Control requesting documents and information with respect to two of 
the Company's distribution facilities. Further, the Company also received a 
subpoena from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office for documents 
and administrative interrogatories requesting information, among other things, 
regarding the Company's handling of materials and hazardous waste. California 
state and local government authorities and the State of Nevada have also 
initiated investigations into these matters. The Company is cooperating fully 
with the respective authorities. While management cannot predict the ultimate 
outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a 
material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

9 Commitments 
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have long-term leases for stores and 
equipment. Rentals (including amounts applicable to taxes, insurance, 
maintenance, other operating expenses and contingent rentals) under operating 
leases and other short-term rental arrangements were $1.8 billion, $1.6 billion 
and $1.4 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Aggregate minimum annual 
rentals at January 31, 2009, under non-cancelable leases are as follows:

Certain of the Company's leases provide for the payment of contingent rentals 
based on a percentage of sales. Such contingent rentals amounted to $21 million, 
$33 million and $41 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Substantially 
all of the Company's store leases have renewal options, some of which may 
trigger an escalation in rentals. 
In connection with certain debt financing, we could be liable for early 
termination payments if certain unlikely events were to occur. At January 31, 
2009, the aggregate termination payment would have been $153 million. The two 
arrangements pursuant to which these payments could be made expire in fiscal 
2011 and fiscal 2019. 
In connection with the development of our grocery distribution network in the 
United States, we have agreements with third parties which would require us to 
purchase or assume the leases on certain unique equipment in the event the 
agreements are terminated. These agreements, which can be terminated by either 
party at will, cover up to a five-year period and obligate the Company to pay up 
to approximately $66 million upon termination of some or all of these 
agreements. 
The Company has potential future lease commitments for land and buildings for 
approximately 321 future locations. These lease commitments have lease terms 
ranging from 1 to 35 years and provide for certain minimum rentals. If executed, 
payments under operating leases would increase by $72 million for fiscal 2010, 
based on current cost estimates. 
10 Retirement-Related Benefits 
In the United States, the Company maintains a Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plan 
under which associates generally become participants following one year of 
employment. The Profit Sharing component of the plan is entirely funded by the 
Company, and the Company makes an additional contribution to the associates' 
401(k) component of the plan. In addition to the Company contributions, 
associates may elect to contribute a percentage of their earnings to the 401(k) 
component of the plan. During fiscal 2009, participants could contribute up to 
50% of their pretax earnings, but not more than statutory limits. 
Associates may choose from among 13 different investment options for the 401(k) 
component of the plan and 14 investment options for the Profit Sharing component 
of the plan. For associates who do not make an investment election, their 401(k) 
balance in the plan is placed in a balanced fund. Associates' 401(k) funds 
immediately vest, and associates may change their investment options at any 
time. Associates with three years of service have full diversification rights

Page 188 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
with the 14 investment options for the Profit Sharing component of the plan. 
Prior to January 31, 2008, associates were fully vested in the Profit Sharing 
component of the plan after seven years of service, with vesting starting at 20% 
at three years of service and increasing 20% each year until year seven. 
Effective January 31, 2008, associates are fully vested in the Profit Sharing 
component of the plan after six years of service, with vesting starting at 20% 
at two years of service and increasing 20% each year until year six. 
Annual contributions made by the Company to the United States and Puerto Rico 
Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plans are made at the sole discretion of the Company. 
Contribution expense associated with these plans was $1.0 billion, $945 million 
and $890 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
Employees in foreign countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various 
post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans are administered based upon 
the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are 
established. Annual contributions to foreign retirement savings and profit 
sharing plans are made at the discretion of the Company, and were $210 million, 
$267 million and $274 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
The Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan have defined benefit 
pension plans. The plan in the United Kingdom was underfunded by $34 million at 
January 31, 2009 and overfunded by $5 million at January 31, 2008. The plan in 
Japan was underfunded by $289 million and $202 million at January 31, 2009 and 
2008, respectively. These underfunded amounts have been recorded in our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with SFAS 158, "Employers' Accounting 
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB 
Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)" ("SFAS 158"). Certain other foreign 
operations have defined benefit arrangements that are not significant. 
38 
11 Segments 
The Company is engaged in the operations of retail stores located in all 50 
states of the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa 
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto 
Rico and the United Kingdom. The Company identifies segments in accordance with 
the criteria set forth in SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an 
Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS 131") and is primarily based on the 
operations of the Company that our chief operating decision maker regularly 
reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources among business units of 
the Company. We sell similar individual products and services in each of our 
segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenue and profits for 
each of these individual products and services. 
The 
Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the 
United States under the Walmart brand, as well as walmart.com. The Sam's Club 
segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the United States as well as

Page 189 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
samsclub.com. The International segment consists of the Company's operations 
outside of the United States. The amounts under the caption "Other" in the table 
below relating to operating income are unallocated corporate overhead items. 
The Company measures the profit of its segments as "segment operating income," 
which is defined as income from continuing operations before net interest 
expense, income taxes and minority interest and excludes unallocated corporate 
overhead and results of discontinued operations. From time to time, we revise 
the measurement of each segment's operating income as changes in business needs 
dictate. When we do, we restate all periods presented for comparative purposes. 
Information on segments and the reconciliation to consolidated income from 
continuing operations before income taxes, minority interest and discontinued 
operations appear in the following tables.

In the United States, long-lived assets, net, excluding goodwill and other 
assets and deferred charges were $68.0 billion, $66.8 billion and $62.3 billion 
as of January 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In the United States, 
additions to long-lived assets were $7.5 billion, $10.4 billion and $12.2 
billion in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
Outside of the United States, long-lived assets, net, excluding goodwill and 
other assets and deferred charges were $27.6 billion, $30.1 billion and $26.0 
billion as of fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Outside of the United 
States, additions to long-lived assets were $4.0 billion, $4.5 billion and $3.5 
billion in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The International segment 
includes all real estate outside the United States. The operations of the 
Company's ASDA subsidiary are significant in comparison to the total operations 
of the International segment. ASDA's sales during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 
were $34.1 billion, $33.4 billion and $28.9 billion, respectively. The 
depreciation of the British pound against the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2009 
adversely impacted ASDA's sales in that year by $3.0 billion. ASDA's long-lived 
assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, net, totaled $10.8 
billion, $14.2 billion and $13.2 billion at January 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,

13 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 which requires recognition of 
the funded status of a benefit plan in the statement of financial position. The 
Standard also requires recognition in other comprehensive income of certain 
gains and losses that arise during the period but are deferred under pension 
accounting rules, as well as modifies the timing of reporting and adds certain 
disclosures. The Company adopted the funded status recognition and disclosure

Page 196 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
elements as of January 31, 2007, and the measurement elements as of January 31, 
2009, as required by SFAS 158. The adoption of SFAS 158 did not have a material 
impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" 
("SFAS 141(R)"). SFAS 141(R) replaces SFAS 141, "Business Combinations," but 
retains the requirement that the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions 
be used for all business combinations. SFAS 141(R) expands on the disclosures 
previously required by SFAS 141, better defines the acquirer and the acquisition 
date in a business combination and establishes principles for recognizing and 
measuring the assets acquired (including goodwill), the liabilities assumed and 
any noncontrolling interests in the acquired business. SFAS 141(R) also requires 
an acquirer to record an adjustment to income tax expense for changes in 
valuation allowances or uncertain tax positions related to acquired businesses. 
SFAS 141(R) is effective for all business combinations with an acquisition date 
in the first annual period following December 1, 2008; early adoption is not 
permitted. The Company adopted this statement as of February 1, 2009. The 
Company does not expect SFAS 141(R) to have a material impact on the Company's 
income tax expense related to adjustments for changes in valuation allowances 
and tax reserves for prior business combinations. 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in 
Consolidated Financial Statements-an amendment of ARB No. 51" ("SFAS 160"). SFAS 
160 requires that noncontrolling (or minority) interests in subsidiaries be 
reported in the equity section of the Company's balance sheet, rather than in a 
mezzanine section of the balance sheet between liabilities and equity. SFAS 160 
also changes the manner in which the net income of the subsidiary is reported 
and disclosed in the controlling company's income statement and establishes 
guidelines for accounting for changes in ownership percentages and for 
de-consolidation. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements for fiscal 
years beginning on or after December 1, 2008 and interim periods within those 
years. The Company adopted SFAS 160 as of February 1, 2009. As SFAS 160 will 
only impact the Company's presentation of minority interests on its balance 
sheet, the adoption of SFAS 160 is not expected to have a material impact on the 
Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative 
Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 161"). SFAS 161 is intended to 
improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand the 
effects of the derivative instruments on an entity's financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows. The Company adopted SFAS 161 as of 
February 1, 2009. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of 
SFAS 161 on its financial statements. 
In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles" ("SFAS 162"). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of 
accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used 
in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are 
presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS 162 
directs the hierarchy to the entity, rather than the independent auditors, as 
the entity is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial 
statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles. SFAS 162 is currently effective and its adoption did not have a 
significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash 
flows. 
In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03-06-1, "Determining Whether 
Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating

Page 197 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Securities" ("FSP EITF 03-06-1"). FSP EITF 03-06-1 provides that unvested 
share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or 
dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and 
shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the 
two-class method in SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share". The Company adopted FSP 
EITF 03-06-1 as of February 1, 2009. The Company is currently assessing the 
potential impact of FSP EITF 03-06-1 on its financial statements. 
14 Subsequent Events 
On March 5, 2009, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase in the 
annual dividends for fiscal year 2010 to $1.09 per share. The annual dividend 
will be paid in four quarterly installments on April 6, 2009, June 1, 2009, 
September 8, 2009, and January 4, 2010, to holders of record on March 13, May 
15, August 14 and December 11, 2009, respectively. 
On March 27, 2009, the Company issued and sold GBP1.0 billion of 5.625% Notes 
Due 2034 at an issue price equal to 98.981% of the notes' aggregate principal 
amount. Interest started accruing on the notes on March 27, 2009. The Company 
will pay interest on the notes on March 27 and September 27 of each year, 
commencing on September 27, 2009. The notes will mature on March 27, 2034. The 
notes are senior, unsecured obligations of

statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over 
Financial Reporting

Page 199 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 
We have audited Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s internal control over financial 
reporting as of January 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal 
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Wal-Mart Stores, 
Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over 
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal 
control over financial reporting included in the accompanying "Management's 
Report to Our Shareholders". Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective 
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material 
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over 
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing 
[ 09-04-09 1101GMT ] 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable 
basis for our opinion. 
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over 
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to 
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of 
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting 
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
As indicated in the accompanying "Management's Report to Our Shareholders", 
management's assessment of and conclusion on effectiveness of internal control 
over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of 
Distribución y 
Servicio D&S S.A., which is included in the fiscal 2009 consolidated financial 
statements of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and constituted 2.2% and 0.0% of 
consolidated total assets and consolidated net sales, respectively, of Wal-Mart 
Stores, Inc. as of, and for the year ended January 31, 2009. Our audit of

Page 200 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
internal control over financial reporting of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. also did not 
include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of 
Distribución y Servicio D&S S.A. 
In our opinion, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009, 
based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. as of January 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each 
of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2009 and our report dated 
March 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management's Report to Our Shareholders 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 
Management of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Wal-Mart", the "Company" or "we") is 
responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of Wal-Mart's 
Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in 
this Annual Report to Shareholders. Those Consolidated Financial Statements were 
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States. In preparing those Consolidated Financial Statements, management 
was required to make certain estimates and judgments, which are based upon 
currently available information and management's view of current conditions and 
circumstances. 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists solely of 
independent directors, oversees our process of reporting financial information 
and the audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Audit Committee

Page 201 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
stays informed of the financial condition of Wal-Mart and regularly reviews 
management's financial policies and procedures, the independence of our 
independent auditors, our internal control over financial reporting and the 
objectivity of our financial reporting. Both the independent auditors and the 
internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee and meet with the 
Audit Committee periodically, both with and without management present. 
Acting through our Audit Committee, we have retained Ernst & Young LLP, an 
independent registered public accounting firm, to audit our Consolidated 
Financial Statements found in this Annual Report to Shareholders. We have made 
available to Ernst & Young LLP all of our financial records and related data in 
connection with their audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") the required 
certifications related to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for 
the year ended January 31, 2009. These certifications are attached as exhibits 
to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2009. 
Additionally, we have also provided to the New York Stock Exchange the required 
annual certification of our Chief Executive Officer regarding our compliance 
with the New York Stock Exchange's corporate governance listing standards. 
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal 
control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external 
reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has 
assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial 
reporting as of January 31, 2009. In making its assessment, management has 
utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
("COSO") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
. Management concluded that based on its assessment, Wal-Mart's internal control 
over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2009. The Company's 
internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009, has been 
audited by Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their report which appears in this 
Annual Report to Shareholders. 
Management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control 
over financial reporting excluded Distribución y Servicio D&S S.A. ("D&S"), of 
which the Company purchased a controlling interest in fiscal 2009. This entity 
represented, in the aggregate, 2.2% and 0.0% of consolidated total assets and 
consolidated net sales, respectively, of the Company as of and for the year 
ended January 31, 2009. This acquisition is more fully discussed in Note 6 to 
our Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2009. Under guidelines 
established by the SEC, companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their 
first assessment of internal control over financial reporting following the date 
of the acquisition. 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable 
assurance that information required to be timely disclosed is accumulated and 
communicated to management in a timely fashion. Management has assessed the

Page 202 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
effectiveness of these disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 
2009, and determined they were effective as of that date to provide reasonable 
assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file 
or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, was accumulated 
and communicated to management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions 
regarding required disclosure and were effective to provide reasonable assurance 
that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the 
time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. 
44 
Report on Ethical Standards 
Our Company was founded on the belief that open communications and the highest 
standards of ethics are necessary to be successful. Our long-standing "Open 
Door" communication policy helps management be aware of and address issues in a 
timely and effective manner. Through the open door policy all associates are 
encouraged to inform management at the appropriate level when they are concerned 
about any matter pertaining to Wal-Mart. 
Wal-Mart has adopted a Statement of Ethics to guide our associates in the 
continued observance of high ethical standards such as honesty, integrity and 
compliance with the law in the conduct of Wal-Mart's business. Familiarity and 
compliance with the Statement of Ethics is required of all associates who are 
part of management. The Company also maintains a separate Code of Ethics for our 
senior financial officers. Wal-Mart also has in place a Related-Party 
Transaction Policy. This policy applies to Wal-Mart's senior officers and 
directors and requires material related-party transactions to be reviewed by the 
Audit Committee. The senior officers and directors are required to report 
material related-party transactions to Wal-Mart. We maintain a global ethics 
office which oversees and administers an ethics helpline. The ethics helpline 
provides a channel for associates to make confidential and anonymous complaints 
regarding potential violations of our statements of ethics, including violations 
related to financial or accounting matters.

New Chief at Wal-Mart Looks Abroad For Growth

New Chief at Wal-Mart Looks Abroad For Growth

New Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Chief Executive Mike Duke took the helm of the world's largest retailer Sunday, tasked 
with keeping his company growing in the midst of a contracting global economy. 
Mr. Duke, who is only the fourth chief executive officer in Wal-Mart's nearly 47-year history, succeeds retiring 
CEO H. Lee Scott Jr. just as the giant discounter has begun to feel the weight of a deepening recession. 
Sales rose just 1.7% in December at Wal-Mart's U.S. stores that have been open at least a year. That was better 
than the performance of the vast majority of retailers, but worse than Wall Street had expected. At the same time, 
Wal-Mart's foreign profits were diminished by unfavorable currency-exchange rates. Wal-Mart said it expects 
January sales to be between flat and a 2% increase compared with the year-earlier month. 
Mr. Duke, a retail veteran who recently led Wal-Mart through a period of rapid international expansion, isn't 
expected by industry observers to take Wal-Mart far from the path established by his predecessor. 
He is expected to continue expanding Wal-Mart into new foreign markets, especially in developing nations, while 
remodeling domestic stores to better position the company against rivals such as Target Corp. 
"He's a good communicator, a hard worker, and his track record at international was very impressive," said Allen 
Questrom, the former chief executive of J.C. Penney Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc., who serves on 
Wal-Mart's board of directors. "He is highly regarded by those who have worked for him, not just recently, but 
years ago. It was not difficult for the board to choose Mike Duke as Lee's successor." 
Wal-Mart declined to make Mr. Duke or other executives available for this article. 
The company Mr. Duke inherits is vastly different from the one Mr. Scott took over nine years ago. Mr. Scott's 
predecessor, David Glass, led Wal-Mart through a dizzying expansion. But that growth proved hard to sustain, 
and Mr. Scott was faced with mounting bad publicity about the company's employment and business practices. 
Mr. Scott, 59 years old, helped soften Wal-Mart's image with a focus on environmentally sound products and 
sophisticated public relations. Still, the pressure took its toll -- a monthlong vacation in 2006, extremely rare for a 
Wal-Mart executive, is viewed by many in hindsight as a red flag that Mr. Scott was tiring. Board members began 
succession planning that year. 
Mr. Duke, who, like Mr. Scott, is 59 years old, is expected to serve a shorter term as CEO than his predecessors. 
The company has two in-house candidates likely to follow him: Eduardo Castro-Wright, the head of U.S. 
operations, and new international division leader Doug McMillon, who formerly oversaw the Sam's Club 
warehouse stores. 
Wal-Mart is now banking on rapid global expansion, not domestic store openings, to fuel growth over the next five 
years. That makes Mr. Duke the natural choice to succeed Mr. Scott, according to retail analysts, former 
colleagues and representatives of Fortune 500 companies who do business with the Bentonville, Ark., company. 
Mr. Duke acted decisively after taking over the international division in 2005, pulling out of two unprofitable 
markets, Germany and South Korea. He forged partnerships with national companies to expand in Japan and 
enter India, where laws limit foreign direct investment. He hired more native-born managers who understood 
countries' local customs.

Page 218 of 220 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Wal-Mart international now includes more than 3,400 stores and accounts for roughly one-fourth of the company's 
revenue. Wal-Mart just purchased a controlling interest in Distribucion y Servicio D&S SA, a Chile-based 
retailer, for $2.6 billion. It opened an office in Moscow last year and joined a retail trade group there, laying the 
groundwork for entry into the Russian market. 
Wal-Mart's foreign record has been mixed. Still, like Coca-Cola and other brands critics once dismissed as 
exclusively American, some experts say Wal-Mart has a chance to grow explosively around the globe as it brings 
its discount formula to countries where retailing is less sophisticated. 
"The return on investment in countries in South America and elsewhere in the world is far better than putting a 
third store in any U.S. city," said Love Goel, chairman of Growth Ventures Group, a private-equity firm. 
Mr. Duke joined Wal-Mart in 1995 after 23 years with Federated Department Stores and May Department Stores 
and quickly rose through the ranks, adapting easily to small-town Bentonville. He headed Wal-Mart's U.S. stores 
and oversaw its wire-tight logistics operations prior to becoming international chief.
