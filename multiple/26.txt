FRANKFURT -- German coffee retailer Tchibo Holding AG has teamed with the city of Hamburg to try to gain 
control of Beiersdorf AG and pre-empt a bid for the consumer-products maker by Procter & Gamble Co. of the 
U.S., people familiar with the matter said. 
Tchibo, which already owns 30.1% of Hamburg-based Beiersdorf, and the city have offered to buy all or most of a 
43.6% stake owned by German insurer Allianz AG in hopes of cementing local ownership of the company,these 
people said. 
The two sides are scheduled to discuss the idea later this week, they said. In a letter to Allianz Chief Executive 
Michael Diekmann and Chief Financial Officer Paul Achleitner, Tchibo CEO Dieter Ammer suggested the group 
would be willing to pay at least the average price of Beiersdorf shares during the past 12 months, these people 
said. 
That translates into 107 euros a share, putting a price of 3.95 billion euros on the Allianz stake and valuing 
Beiersdorf, the maker of Nivea skin cream, at around 9 billion euros. In trading Friday on the German Xetra, 
Beiersdorf shares were down 2.25 euros to 108.24 euros. 
In the letter, Mr. Ammer said Tchibo and the city are prepared to move ahead quickly to have a deal in place by 
year's end. 
Said a person familiar with the matter: "Tchibo will meet with Allianz to make an offer for around 20%, and a 
consortium will make an offer for the rest," adding, "They are all friends of the region and they want to ensure that 
Allianz receives a fair offer." 
Hamburg is prepared to contribute 1 billion euros or more to the bid, the people said. The people familiar with the 
effort also said the bid has the support of the Claussen family, which owns about 10% of Beiersdorf. 
If a deal is worked out, it would all but end P&G's hopes of clinching Beiersdorf, and mark a resurgence of the 
clubby industrial, financial and political ties that have protected German companies from foreign takeovers in the 
past. 
P&G has been interested in Beiersdorf for more than a year, and CEO Alan Lafley confirmed that interest in a 
recent interview in the German news weekly Der Spiegel, but noted that P&G has never carried out a hostile bid. 
Nivea is just the kind of product P&G would like to have in its vast portfolio. Nivea sales have grown to 2.62 billion 
euros in 2002 from 695 million euros in 1992. Beiersdorf also owns the Tesa, Eucerin, Hansaplast and Futuro 
brands of personal-care products. Earlier this year, P&G obtained control of German hair-products maker Wella 
AG by buying out the founding family's shares. 
Allianz, which owns stakes in hundreds of German companies, is widely seen as the key to breaking up the old 
so-called Germany Inc. system of protective shareholders. It has begun selling off its holdings to free up capital, 
which could open scores of German firms to bids by outsiders. 
A sale of the Beiersdorf stake, however, has proved tricky because Tchibo, with its large stake, can prevent any 
buyer from getting absolute control.

About 26% of the company is in free float. Because Tchibo can't afford the entire stake on its own, it has turned 
for support to the Claussen family, descendants of former Beiersdorf Chief Executives Carl Claussen and Georg 
W. Claussen, and the city of Hamburg. 
The city is concerned about preserving the 4,800 jobs at Beiersdorf's headquarters and about 200 million euros in 
corporate taxes. Hamburg already has seen the exodus of jobs after haircare-products maker Hans Schwarzkopf 
GmbH, tobacco firm Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, tourism and shipping company Hapag-Lloyd AG and 
the Vereins-& Westbank AG were taken over. 
"The Hamburg Senate places great importance on keeping Beiersdorf in Hamburg," said Hamburg Sen. Gunnar 
Uldall in a statement last month. "It's not just about creating and keeping jobs here, but about keeping 
decision-making power in Hamburg." 
Aside from lobbying members of the local Herz and Claussen families not to sell their stakes to an outside 
company, Hamburg politicians also placed calls to Bavarian politicians urging their counterparts to put pressure 
on Allianz 
"Don't let Allianz sell our company into foreign hands," was the message, a person familiar with the matter said. 
The consortium is also courting the support of Joachim Herz, whose family owns most of Tchibo. Representatives 
of the Claussen and Herz families, respectively, couldn't be reached for comment. Allianz and Beiersdorf couldn't 
be reached for comment. 
Should another company choose to respond to the bid, Tchibo is best placed to increase the value of its offer 
because it is exempt from a clause in Germany's takeover law that forces bidders to extend an offer to all 
shareholders if they bid for more than 30% in a company. Tchibo is exempt from this rule because it acquired its 
30.1% Beiersdorf stake before January 2001, when new German takeover rules were introduced. 
Asked whether he preferred to keep Beiersdorf independent, Beiersdorf Chief Executive Rolf Kunisch said last 
month, "We are not independent. We are responsible for the future of the company and our shareholders. I am 
interested in the long-term value increase for our shareholders."

U.S. consumer goods producer Procter & Gamble Co. is still interested in buying into German cosmetics 
company Beiersdorf AG, but does not plan to launch a hostile takeover bid, P&G CEO Alan Lafley said on 
October 5, 2003. 
Lafley said P&G had always been interested in companies and brands that complement or impact on its core 
business, adding that Beiersdorf was very attractive but P&G sought to buy only companies, which were really for 
sale. 
Media speculations that P&G was interested in buying a 44 stake in Beiersdorf from German insurer Allianz arose 
at the end of September 2003, after former co-owner of coffee and tea maker Tchibo Holding AG, Guenter Herz, 
denied plans to buy the Allianz stake. 
P&G bought a majority stake in German hair care products group Wella AG for 6.5 bln euro ($7.5 bln) in March 
2003. Lafley declined to comment on the number of Wella employees that P&G will lay off after the takeover. 
[Editor's note: Beiersdorf produces the NIVEA, Labello and Atrixo cosmetics brands. The company had 18,000 
employees and generated a 4.7 bln euro ($5.4 bln) turnover in 2002.]

BERLIN -(Dow Jones)- Procter & Gamble Co.'s (PG) takeover of German haircare products maker Wella AG 
(G.WEL) will generate synergies mainly through economics of scale, P&G CEO Alan Lafley told Frankfurter 
Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview, adding however that there surely will be overlaps between the two business. 
P&G has promised synergies of EUR300 million from the third year onwards.

(This story contains additional information, updating the item published at 1412 GMT.) 
By Edward Taylor 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
FRANKFURT -(Dow Jones)- Branded goods company Henkel KGaA (G.HEN) accumulated a 6.86% stake in 
Wella AG (G.WEL), creating a poison pill for any potential rival bidder for the hair-care company. 
The Duesseldorf-based owner of Duck-brand tape, Persil washing powder, Pritt Stick and Loctite Superglue 
brands, disclosed the stake late Monday and said Tuesday that it purchased it because the price was right. 
Analysts, however, see the purchase as a crafty move to thwart a bid for Wella from U.S.-rival Procter & Gamble 
(PG). 
Many market participants didn't welcome the prospect of a bidding war between Henkel and P&G. Around 1640 
GMT, Henkel's ordinary shares were trading down 7.6% at EUR45.10 and preferred shares were off 8.2% at 
EUR51.60. Wella's ordinary shares were up 5.13% at EUR76.80, while preferred shares rose 1.82% to 
EUR62.10. 
Henkel said it bought 2,206,414 common as well as 2,2428,100 preferred shares in Darmstadt-based Wella 
through a subsidiary. Although Henkel didn't disclose the purchase price, WGZ bank analyst Bernd Schnarr said 
Henkel spent around EUR309 million for the stake. 
Henkel wouldn't comment on whether the move was part of a poison pill strategy. In a statement, it said that 
"Henkel sees this as an interesting investment in view of the current climate on the stock market." 
Even if that were the case, Schnarr said, "buying the stake is a way of making a takeover much more difficult for 
other potential bidders, or it could be a first step toward an outright takeover." 
Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein also rejected Henkel's explanation as insufficient and saw the move as an 
attempt to block a rival bid. "Henkel now has a poison pill for any (Wella) buyer," it said in a research note. 
"If it's such a good time to buy shares, why aren't they buying back their own," another analyst said. 
Takeover rumors regarding Wella lifted ordinary shares to above EUR75 Tuesday from EUR58 a week ago after 
reports that P&G had made an offer for Wella, which was said to be worth about EUR5.5 billion to EUR6.5 billion. 
Wella and P&G declined to comment at the time. But Alan Lafley, CEO of P&G, has in the past expressed 
interest in expanding the company's market share in health and beauty care. 
"We have no comment regarding this matter," P&G spokesman Andrew Fisk said Tuesday. P&G also declined to 
comment on whether it would counter any bid from Henkel. 
Through buying 4.99% of common shares and 10.38% of preferred nonvoting shares, Henkel can make a 
takeover much more expensive for rival bidders. Under German law, a potential bidder needs to acquire more 
than 95% of a company to squeeze out other shareholders. "With Henkel holding 6.86%, this is no longer 
possible," Schnarr added. 
Stroeher Family Members Hold Major Stake

Page 7 of 10 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
So far, a takeover bid for Wella, which has a market capitalization of EUR4.03 billion, has been prevented 
because of objections from members of the Stroeher family, which controls 78% of ordinary shares through 
complex family shareholdings. 
Henkel issued statements inviting analysts to believe it had acquired the Wella stake from a single source, 
possibly a member of the Stroeher family. 
"We were offered the Wella stake from a third party and have acquired the stake over a period of time," Henkel 
spokesman Sven Jacobsen said. So far, outside firms have been unable to persuade Stroeher family members to 
relinquish control. 
But analysts remain skeptical about the origins of the stake since Henkel declined to divulge the identity of the 
seller, the price of the acquisition, or name the unit through which the stake was acquired. 
Henkel is more likely to have bought the shares on the market, according to DrKW. "We don't believe the shares 
were purchased from the Stroeher family or a big shareholder," it said in a note. 
A representative of the Stroeher family couldn't be reached for comment. 
Wella spokeswoman Birgit Klesper couldn't shed further light on the matter, saying, "We only know about the 
purchase from statements made by Henkel." 
Henkel already made one unsuccessful informal bid for Wella in the past 18 months, analysts said. Henkel 
declined comment on the matter. Wella's spokeswoman Birgit Klesper said the offer would have gone to the 
descendants of founder Franz Stroeher. "I can't speak for them, but no offer was made to the company." 
Henkel declined to comment directly about whether it intends to increase its stake in Wella but said, "We will 
expand organically and through acquisitions, providing we see a strategic fit and an appropriate price can be 
agreed upon." 
Should Wella's controlling shareholders consent to a sale, Henkel could raise up to EUR2.5 billion for an 
acquisition without having to resort to a capital increase or asset sales. With the disposal of stakes in units such 
as Clorox and Ecolab, and asset sales, Henkel could raise between EUR6 billion and EUR6.5 billion, analysts 
say. 
"We can go up to EUR2.5 billion without asset sales or without a capital increase," Henkel Chief Financial Officer 
Jochen Krautter told journalists at a Duesseldorf conference last week. "I see expansion by organic growth and 
acquisitions as the right strategy," he said. 
Henkel last week said it plans to expand its personal care unit, which posted EUR184 million in earnings before 
interest and taxes in 2001, and will focus on expanding its market share in hair, skin and body-care products.

Procter & Gamble (P&G) wants to expand its range of body- health- and beauty-care products--a sector in which 
its annual sales currently reach almost $15bn a year. 
Interviewed by a Paris-based paper, P&G President Alan Lafley said the company was still a relatively small 
player in these very rapidly growing markets. He said the company had between $8bn and $10bn accumulated in 
the past two years and now available for acquisitions. The background aim was an increase in annual sales of 
4%-6% with 2% coming from the natural progression of markets. 
As far as care products were concerned, acquisitions had been made because they were both logical and 
complementary. They were in the shampoo sector, for example, and so had taken over Clairol because it was the 
quickest and most effective way to enter the hair colouring market. 
Asked about the possible acquisition of Wella AG, Lafley said P&G wanted to develop the haircare market and 
one preoccupation was to reinforce its position in Europe where it was still relatively weak. He said he did not 
want to comment on any particular issue and he had seen Wella had rejected an offer from Henkel and would 
now wait to see what Wella wanted to do. 
On the Beiersdorf-Nivea acquisition saga, Lafley said an acquisition was only of interest to P&G if it was of 
strategic significance in the development of long-term brands. Lafley also said in relation to the perfumes 
segment that his company was seeking brands which were under-exploited commercially and which had the 
potential to become classics.
