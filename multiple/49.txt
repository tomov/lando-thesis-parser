Starent Shareholders OK Cisco Deal

Now that's the way Cisco Systems likes its acquisitions to go. 
Starent Networks, which makes infrastructure products for wireless service providers such as AT&T and Verizon, 
announced that shareholders had at a special meeting Dec. 11 in Boston approved the proposed $2.9 billion 
acquisition by Cisco. 
The deal, which still has to get approval from regulators, is expected to close in the first half of 2010. 
The Starent acquisition, first announced Oct. 13, is going along much more smoothly than Cisco's attempt to buy 
video conferencing equipment maker Tandberg. 
In that deal, announced Oct. 1, Cisco has had to raise the bid to $3.4 billion and extend its deadline several times 
before finally gaining control of enough of the company's stock to go ahead with the purchase. 
Cisco announced Dec. 3 that it finally had gained the desired 90 percent of Tandberg shares. 
Starent was able to stave off investor lawsuits filed by shareholders unhappy with the price being offered by Cisco. 
The Starent acquisition is one of several Cisco is making as it looks to expand beyond its traditional networking 
business. With Starent, Cisco aims to extend its reach in the mobile Internet space as the smartphones and other 
Web-connected devices used by consumers and businesses proliferate. 
Cisco officials predict that global data traffic on the Internet will more than double every year through at least 
2013. 
Along with Tandberg, another big purchase by Cisco in 2009 was of Flip video camera maker Pure Digital, in May 
for about $590 million. 
Cisco CEO John Chambers and other officials have said the company will continue its aggressive acquisitions 
as it branches out into other markets.

* Cites economic recovery 
* Pushes into new markets via acquisitions, development (Adds CEO and analyst comments) 
By Ritsuko Ando 
SAN JOSE, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc's CEO John Chambers reaffirmed the network equipment 
maker's long-term target of 12-17 percent annual revenue growth, citing an economic recovery and expansion 
into new markets. 
Cisco has fallen short of such growth rates in the past year as customers cut back on technology spending, but 
Chambers, at a financial analyst conference, said conditions had improved in recent quarters. 
"Most of our customers on a global basis had cut just about everything they could cut over the last 18 months. 
And the conversation is turning to, 'If I continue to cut I'm into muscle. I'll do that if I have to,'" Chambers said on 
Tuesday. 
"But they're really saying, 'Where can I grow?'" he added. 
Chambers said later that the mid-point of the 12-17 percent range would be a mere "B" grade result, and that an 
"A" grade achievement would be growth at the high end or above. 
"I would like to operate at the higher end of that range," he told reporters. "We realize, however, you always want 
to be very realistic." 
Having established market leadership in its main servers and routers business, Cisco is expanding into data 
center servers as well as consumer markets to support long-term growth. 
While Chambers declined to forecast when Cisco would achieve the 12-17 percent target, analysts predicted it 
was possible within the next year or two, saying Cisco's leadership and sales teams were good at execution. 
"As long as the global economy continues its recovery, we continue to believe Cisco can achieve this objective 
over the next few years," said Ticonderoga Securities analyst Brian White. 
Cisco's revenue in its fiscal first quarter, which ended Oct. 24, fell 13 percent from a year earlier. It has forecast 
revenue this quarter to be up by 1-4 percent. 
Jefferies & Co analyst Bill Choi also endorsed Cisco's growth plans, saying it had successfully positioned its 
nework gear to benefit from the many Internet applications being developed, such as online video. 
"The cellphone as a category is increasingly adopting capabilities from adjacent markets, like cameras, music 
capabilities, and now Internet browsing. My view is that networking is kind of like that too," Choi said. 
He and other analysts said a key challenge would be Cisco's increasing competition with Hewlett-Packard Co and 
International Business Machines Corp. Cisco earlier this year announced it would begin selling servers for data 
centers, putting itself in direct competition with the two companies, traditionally its resale partners.

Page 6 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
HP, for its part, has announced it would buy network equipment maker 3Com, Cisco's much smaller rival. IBM 
has also been cutting back on its reliance on Cisco by tying partnerships with other equipment makers like 
Juniper Networks Inc. 
Chambers said Cisco would continue to aggressively push into new markets, regardless of such challenges, 
whether it be through investment or through acquisitions. 
M&A PUSH 
Acquisitions have helped turn Cisco, which turns 25 years old this week, into the world's biggest network 
equipment maker with annual revenue in excess of $35 billion. When Chambers became CEO in 1995, it had only 
around $1 billion in revenue. 
The company's strategy is to turn emerging technologies into profitable entities, and to then integrate them with 
the rest of the business to contribute to overall growth. 
Cisco's acquisition of the maker of Flip video camcorders, as well as its development of high-definition 
videoconferencing systems called TelePresence, are examples of that strategy. Both products help drive Internet 
traffic, which in turn creates demand for routers and switches. 
Chambers said the company plans to make sure its various technologies, including the Flip camcorder as well as 
its videoconferencing, e-mail and messaging services, eventually work together. 
Addressing concerns that Cisco may expand too far too fast, hurting profitability, Chambers said the company 
would stick to its principles of going into areas where it was confident of winning sizeable market share. 
"When we move into market adjacencies we don't move blindly into these. We learned a lot from GE (General 
Electric Co) and others... We don't move unless we have a sustainable differentiation," he said. 
For example, he said, Cisco would not compete with Apple Inc, Research in Motion or Microsoft Corp in 
smartphones, but would instead focus on the equipment and software that support wireless Internet access. 
"We love the way Apple and RIM and Microsoft are loading the networks and we want to interoperate within that. 
Remember, when we enter markets we enter to be number 1 or number 2," he said. 
MASTERING THE DEAL, GOING GLOBAL 
Chambers said Cisco's leadership had mastered dealmaking, enabling it to pick up its pace of acquisitions since 
Oct. 1, when it announced plans to buy Norwegian videoconferencing company Tandberg ASA. 
"In 45 days we did four acquisitions around the world, three of them outside the U.S.," he said. 
"We didn't even break a sweat," he said, but with a chuckle quickly added that they may have, just a bit. 
The Tandberg deal initially faced strong opposition from the Norwegian company's shareholders, forcing Cisco to 
raise its offer price. Cisco eventually won control over more than 90 percent of Tandberg and now plans to close 
the deal pending regulatory approval. 
Cisco ended last quarter with $35.4 billion of cash and investments, and although it has since announced multiple 
deals it also has replenished its war chest with a $5 billion debt sale, meaning more multi-billion dollar deals are 
possible. 
With most of its cash held overseas, Chambers said it made sense that its acquisition strategy was becoming 
more global, although he also encouraged Washington to adopt policies to encourage U.S. companies to 
repatriate their profits. 
"We will invest where we make our profits," he said. "You will see our partners and acquisitions strategy go 
global." 
He said Cisco was particularly keen on expanding in China, where it faces stiff competition from Huawei 
Technologies Co. 
"I think it's time to take it up one more level and I think you'll see us do that," he said. (Editing by Tim Dobbyn and

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The following are comments from Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) Chief Executive John 
Chambers at the company's analyst conference: 
12:23 p.m.: Chambers wraps up his presentation and hands it over to Chief Strategy Officer Ned Hooper. 
12:21 p.m.: A wide show of hands illustrates the strong support for Cisco's Tandberg acquisition. Chambers 
noted that a few weeks ago, the support wasn't nearly as strong. 
12:19 p.m.: Cisco's strategy of moving into new businesses was based off of what it learned from General Electric 
Co. (GE), Chambers said. Note: GE has just moved out of the content business by selling a majority stake of 
NBC Universal to Comcast Corp. (CMCSK, CMCSA). 
12:07 p.m.: Chambers to the Cisco employee running the IP phone demonstration during his speech: "If we were 
giving out raises, I'd give you one right now." Crowd chuckles at the awkward attempt at humor. 
11:56 a.m.: Touting the company's new management structure, which disperses power across many managers to 
focus on more new businesses, Chambers said that in 45 days between October to November, Cisco acquired 
four companies, three outside the U.S., struck its strategic partnership with EMC Corp. (EMC) and VMWare Inc. 
(VMW). "We didn't break a sweat...well, maybe a little sweat." 
11:47 a.m.: Chambers called hitting the middle of that 12% to 17% growth target a "B" job. A few skeptical 
analysts on Wall Street may give him a higher grade if Cisco gets back to that point. 
11:43 a.m.: The key to successful acquisitions lies in keeping talent, Chambers said. He points to the number of 
top managers and engineers from acquired companies still with Cisco after 12 to 18 months. "At Cisco, we're all 
outsiders, but this leadership is a family," he said. 
11:36 a.m.: On becoming a one-stop IT shop: "Others will say it's my territory." Hello, Hewlett-Packard Co. 
(HPQ)? "Others will partner with you." He added that whenever Cisco moves into a new market, it is almost 
always successful. 
11:31 a.m.: "Who's better than Cisco at acquisitions?" he asked an audience member, who awkwardly opted not 
to answer. Aside from a slight hiccup with Tandberg ASA (TAA.OS), which was resolved, Cisco has smoothly 
gobbled up an increasing amount of small companies in the last few months. 
11:29 a.m.: Chambers said he was comfortable with the market share growth in its core routing and switching 
business. Not surprising, given Cisco is the dominant player in both. The only question is whether Cisco spends 
money to go after someone else's share, he added. 
11:26 a.m.: Again, with the confidence: "I'm more comfortable than I've ever been" with the long-term revenue 
growth forecast of 12% to 17%. He acknowledged the skepticism, but added that analysts should hold the 
company accountable to that number. 
11:24 a.m. EST: Chambers looking confident as he strides from row to row among the audience. "I'm the most 
comfortable I've ever been with Cisco," he said.

After a hard-fought battle, Cisco has won control of videoconferencing leader Tandberg with ownership of 91.1% 
of the 
company's shares. 
Hottest tech M&A deals of 2009 
Cisco had to raise its initial $3 billion offer and extend the acceptance deadline three times in order to gain control 
of 
the company. Cisco's initial offer, made on Oct. 1, was rejected by more than 90% of Tandberg shareholders. 
Late Thursday, at the expiration of the third acceptance deadline, Cisco said it controlled 89.1% of Tandberg 
shares. The 
condition for ownership of the company was control of 90% of Tandberg shares, but Cisco waived this condition 
based on a 2% 
stake it acquired in November, according to published reports. 
Of the 140 or so acquisitions Cisco has made in the past 16 years, Tandberg was perhaps the most challenging. 
Two groups of 
shareholders controlling 30% of the company balked at the initial $3 billion offer. And then two investment firms 
representing 
other stakeholders issued a public letter to Cisco CEO John Chambers and Senior Vice President Ned Hooper 
stating that Cisco 
was undervaluing the company and spelling out specific reasons why it should hike its offer. 
Cisco relented on Nov. 16, raising its offer for Tandberg to $3.4 billion and extending the acceptance deadline to 
Dec. 1 
from Nov. 18. The Nov. 18 deadline had previously been extended from Nov. 9. 
On Dec. 1, Cisco again extended the acceptance deadline by two days, to Dec. 3. 
By acquiring Tandberg, Cisco is looking to fill out its desktop and midrange videoconferencing product portfolio. 
Its high-end 
TelePresence offerings can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and are apparently too costly and elaborate to 
scale downmarket, 
as Cisco initially intended. 
Cisco will also now become the market leader in videoconferencing. Tandberg is the current leader with about 
40% share, ahead 
of Polycom, according to Wainhouse Research.

* Banks may earn up to $39 mln in fees - Freeman 
By Quentin Webb and Ritsuko Ando 
LONDON/NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc's veteran dealmakers may have learnt some new 
lessons from their drawn-out pursuit of Norway's Tandberg ASA , the video conferencing leader. 
Cisco could be more careful about talking up the benefits of future deals, and thus making it hard to be firm on 
price. 
It has also discovered the hard way that Scandinavian investors can be tough opponents if they think a deal is 
undervalued. 
On Friday Cisco said it had control of more than 90 percent of Tandberg, allowing it to squeeze out remaining 
shareholders, after it sweetened its offer about 10 percent to $3.4 billion. [ID:nGEE5B30WA] 
Cisco's initial offer met strong resistance, despite backing from Tandberg's board -- a marked difference to its 
usually smooth dealmaking, honed through many deals in the past decade that helped make it the world's largest 
network-equipment maker. 
Less than a tenth of Tandberg shareholders accepted the first bid. Chief Executive John Chambers said the 
challenge was expected, but analysts said Cisco was caught off guard. 
In a sign Cisco believed the deal would go through without a hitch, executives repeatedly emphasised the merits 
of the deal before winning shareholder approval. 
That made it hard for the company to later play hardball, and few investors believed Cisco executives when they 
threatened to walk away, citing "fiscal prudence". 
"I think in the future this is something they will work to avoid," said Brian White, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities. 
"It was certainly a learning experience." 
Cisco eventually raised its bid by about 1.8 billion Norwegian crowns ($323 million) -- hardly a dent in Cisco's 
cash pile of $35.4 billion at the end of the last quarter. Some analysts say, though, that risks setting a bad 
precedent as Cisco eyes more deals overseas, marking it an easy target for demands to up offers. 
However, Peter Germonpre of Panta Capital, a small firm advising on merger arbitrage that publicly opposed the 
offer, said Cisco may have been "very clever" by starting with a low offer which it privately believed it would have 
to raise. 
SCANDINAVIAN TRADITION 
Cisco also ran into something of a Scandinavian tradition: aggrieved investors and brokers, quick to demand 
better terms. 
This happened in the 2006 leveraged buyout of Sweden's Gambro, and the 2007 hostile takeover of Norway's 
Eastern Echo by Schlumberger.

Page 14 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
In Tandberg's case, local investors were also reluctant to see the company, which they value because it helps 
diversify their portfolios, handed over so easily. 
Local and international investors owning 30 percent-plus of Tandberg stock quickly mobilised to decry the offer 
as cheap, with all the touted synergies accruing to Cisco. 
Many complained that the premiums and valuation multiples cited by Cisco were misleading. Some compared the 
offer with a high premium Cisco agreed later in October to pay for wireless equipment company Starent Networks 
Corp . 
FEES 
Emphasising the value of local knowledge, Cisco adviser Lazard will have to share its spoils with Nordic house 
Carnegie, whose role expanded as it became clear Cisco's initial approach had misfired. 
The Stockholm office of Lazard was initially Cisco's sole financial adviser. But as Cisco upped its bid, and won 
crucial backing ahead of time from more than 40 percent of shareholders, it upgraded the Oslo office of Carnegie 
from an administrative role as receiving agent to joint financial adviser. 
That may have helped win over key Norwegian shareholders including its biggest shareholder, Folketrygdfondet, 
which invests Norwegian state pension funds. 
Freeman & Co, the merger consultancy, estimates the duo may earn fees of $17 to $19 million for the deal.

Cisco closes in on $3.4bn Tandberg deal 
Cisco closes in on $3.4bn Tandberg deal

Cisco Systems, the world's largest maker of networking equipment, was close to clinching its $3.38bn offer to buy 
Tandberg on Friday, after winning about 89 per cent of the shares in the Norwegian video conferencing 
equipment company. 
Under Norwegian law Cisco needs 90 per cent of the shares to gain control of the company, but said it would buy 
the remaining 1 per cent it needs in the open market in order to proceed with the deal. 
However, it also emerged on Friday that the deal would come under anti-trust scrutiny by the US Department of 
Justice. Cisco said it had received a "second request" for information by the DOJ, meaning that the authorities 
have concerns about the competition effects of the combination. 
"Cisco intends to respond expeditiously to this request and continue to work cooperatively with the DOJ in 
connection with its review ... Cisco continues to expect the transaction will close during the first half of calendar 
year 2010," the company said. 
The acquisition of Tandberg would leave Polycom, a US competitor, as the only sizeable independent provider of 
video conferencing equipment in the market. LifeSize, a much smaller, Texas-based competitor was acquired by 
Logitech, the Swiss computer peripherals group, last month. 
Tandberg is the second-biggest maker of video conferencing equipment, and would allow Cisco to expand into 
the lower-cost end of the market. Cisco currently makes very high-end telepresence conference rooms, which 
show life-size images of callers and can cost around $300,000 to set up. 
The combination with Tandberg would make Cisco more of a competitor to HP and Microsoft in the collaboration 
market, which John Chambers, Cisco's CEO has estimated to be worth around $34bn. 
Cisco originally offered NKr153.50 a share in cash for Tandberg when it announced the bid in October. However, 
it was forced to raise its offer 11 per cent to NKr170 last month after shareholders representing around 24 per 
cent of shares rejected the offer as too low. 
The new NKr170 per share price matched the target set by ESB Enskilda,the Swedish brokerage, and helped win 
over institutions such as Folketrygdfondet, Norway's domestic pension fund, which is Tandberg's largest 
shareholder with a 10.1 per cent stake.

* 89 pct of Tandberg shareholders accept $3.4 bln deal 
* Creates world leader in video conferencing (Adds Cisco comment it could raise its stake) 
By Ritsuko Ando 
NEW YORK, Dec 3 (Reuters) -- Cisco Systems Inc said it plans to go ahead with its plan to buy Norway's 
Tandberg ASA , paving the way toward creating the world's leader in video conferencing equipment, although 
acceptances from shareholders were slightly below its target. 
Cisco said about 89 percent of shareholders accepted the 19 billion Norwegian crown ($3.4 billion) deal. That was 
lower than the 90 percent Cisco had set as a minimum requirement, but the company said it would waive this 
condition. 
Cisco had struggled to win over the shareholders. Its original bid was rejected by over 90 percent of Tandberg 
shareholders, forcing Cisco to repeatedly extend its offer deadline and raise its bid by 10 percent last month. 
Cisco said it could raise its stake above 90 percent by buying more shares in the open market or through various 
contracts, including options and other financial instruments. 
"We intend on pursuing all options available to us," company spokeswoman Kristin Carvell said in an email to 
Reuters. 
Analysts have said that Cisco will likely eventually make Tandberg and its other video-related products work 
together seamlessly. That will help make Cisco's equipment -- including the routers and switches that support 
online communications -- indispensable to business customers. 
"We think the deal makes sense," Brian White of Ticonderoga Securities said on Thursday. "If they can link it in 
with TelePresence it makes a lot of sense." 
Tandberg is the leading videoconferencing equipment maker, filling a gap between Cisco's high-end 
TelePresence conferencing products and WebEx desktop video service. Tandberg holds 40 percent of the 
mid-tier market for videoconferencing, according to Wainhouse Research. 
While Cisco repeatedly threatened to walk away, most analysts expected it to ensure the deal went through, since 
the leading network equipment maker has repeatedly touted videoconferencing as a key growth business. 
CASH-RICH CISCO 
Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers has said online videoconferencing was on the brink of wider adoption. 
The company estimates the total value of collaboration tools, including everything from videoconferencing to 
Google Apps, at around $34 billion. 
High-quality, real-time videoconferencing can help cut travel costs, and Cisco says it can do more, such as 
helping businesses like retailers, banks and hospitals launch services from remote locations. 
Cisco can pursue such ambitions because is one of the most cash-rich companies in the technology business, 
with $35.4 billion in cash and investments at the end of the quarter. The Tandberg deal also makes use of 
Cisco's cash overseas, which accounts for most of the stockpile.

Emboldened by a recovering economy and customer demands for one-stop-shop type technology services, Cisco 
has been expanding its product line to include networking, security and videoconferencing. 
A few weeks after announcing its bid for Tandberg, Cisco said it also planned to buy advanced wireless 
equipment maker Starent Networks Corp for $2.9 billion. 
MORE DEALS COMING? 
Analysts also have said the deal could trigger more deals in the videoconferencing space. 
No rivals publicly emerged for the Tandberg deal, but analysts have said companies like Microsoft , 
Hewlett-Packard , IBM and Avaya [AVXX.UL] could seek to add videoconferencing services. 
Polycom Inc , the industry's No. 2 player, has been seen as a target, although its CEO told Reuters last month 
that it was looking to step up partnerships with companies like HP and IBM rather than pursue a buyout.

Tandberg shares closed at 163.20 crowns per share, below Cisco's final bid of 170 crowns. Cisco shares fell 4 
cents on the Nasdaq to $23.83 on Thursday but were up slightly in after-hours trading. ($1=5.570 Norwegian

Cisco Snags Shares To Acquire Tandberg 
Cisco Snags Shares To Acquire Tandberg

Cisco missed its latest deadline Thursday for acquiring videoconferencing firm Tandberg, but squeaked across 
the finish line Friday morning after it revealed it has bought enough shares on its own to seal the $3.4 billion 
acquisition. 
Cisco now is confronted with a new hurdle: The U.S. Justice Department is stepping up its review of the 
acquisition. 
At first the acquisition appeared stalled when just 89% of the required 90% stockholder shares had been tendered 
at the close of the working day Thursday, potentially leaving the deal hanging. Cisco had already repeatedly 
extended its offer to meet the requirements of Norwegian law for acquisitions. 
But Friday morning, Cisco said it had nailed down enough shares to acquire the Norwegian videoconferencing 
firm. 
"The shares tendered, combined with shares owned, currently represent approximately 102 million shares, or 
approximately 91.1% of the shares and voting rights in TANDBERG," Cisco's Friday release stated. 
The final acquisition figure represented a more than 50% gain in Tandberg stock from the date when rumors 
started circulating that the company was an acquisition target. 
Since October 1st, when the acquisition was first announced, Tandberg's directors and management supported 
the acquisition. Some stockholders and investment bankers, however, moved to squeeze more money out of 
Cisco, which has more than $30 billion in cash. 
Tandberg's chief executive Fredrik Halvorsen has been picked to lead Cisco's new telepresence technology 
group, reporting to Marthin De Beer, senior VP of Cisco's emerging technologies group. The integration plan calls 
for Tandberg's technology to be integrated into Cisco's existing collaboration architecture. 
The acquisition is just another building block in Cisco CEO John Chambers' vision of expanding well beyond its 
traditional strengths in routers and switches to data centers, servers and particularly to video. 
"Video," Chambers has said in what is becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, "is the next wave of Internet disruption." 
As for the Justice Department's examination of the merger, Cisco said it has received a second request from 
federal regulators for information on the acquisition. The company added that it will "continue to work 
cooperatively" with the DOJ during the review.

US networking giant Cisco said Thursday it plans to go ahead with its 3.4-billion-dollar takeover of Norwegian 
video conferencing company Tandberg. 
Cisco said in a statement that it controls approximately 89 percent of the outstanding shares of Tandberg and 
had decided to waive the condition that it control 90 percent. 
Cisco said it plans to complete the deal as soon as possible. 
The San Jose, California-based Cisco offered 3.0 billion dollars for Tandberg on October 1. 
It later raised its offer to 3.4 billion dollars after facing resistance from shareholders who believed the initial offer 
was too low. 
Tandberg employs 1,500 people worldwide. 
The video conferencing sector is benefiting from the economic crisis as firms decide to lower or eliminate the 
costs associated with business travel. 
According to Cisco managing director John Chambers, the organization of collaborative work at a distance 
amounted to a market worth 34 billion dollars a year and was expanding rapidly. 
Cash-rich Cisco has made a series of acquisitions this year, most recently purchasing Hong Kong-based DVN 
Holdings Ltd, a leading maker of boxes for delivering digital television broadcasts, for 44.5 million dollars. 
Cisco has also agreed to buy San Francisco- and London-based Web security company ScanSafe for some 183 
million dollars and wireless equipment maker Starent Networks for 2.9 billion dollars. 
In March, Cisco bought Pure Digital Technologies, maker of the hot-selling Flip Video camcorder, and purchased 
Tidal Software Inc. the following month.

2 December 2009 - US networking equipment supplier Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) said Wednesday 
morning it has received acceptance for its all-share bid from shareholders, representing 84% of Norwegian 
video-conferencing solutions provider Tandberg ASA (OSL: TAA). 
Yesterday, the offer period was extended once again to 17:30 CET on 3 December 2009. Shortly before the 
original acceptance period expired on 9 November, Cisco had prolonged it to 18 November. 
The bid is conditional on a 90% acceptance. If this condition is not met, Cisco will determine whether to withdraw 
the offer or waive this condition. The US giant said it will not further extend the acceptance deadline. 
On 1 October, Cisco offered NOK153.50 in cash for each share in Tandberg, valuing the company at NOK17bn. 
The offer was considered as too low for the shareholders, who refused to sell. 
Afterwards, Cisco sweetened the bid to NOK170 apiece and CEO John Chambers made it clear this was the 
highest price Cisco would give. 
"This is our last and final offer. If we can't get it closed at this amount, we will walk. But I am very optimistic (...)," 
Chambers said in an interview for TV channel CNBC on 17 November, the day Cisco raised the bid.

Cisco Still Short of Needed Shares for Tandberg Deal

Cisco Systems is still short of having control of the 90 percent of Tandberg shares it has set as a condition for 
buying the Norwegian video conferencing equipment vendor. 
Cisco officials said Dec. 2 that will wait until after the Dec. 3 deadline to decide whether they have reached the 90 
percent threshold. If not, they will either walk away from the $3.4 billion deal or waive the 90 percent requirement, 
they said. 
However, Cisco will not extend the deadline a fourth time. 
Currently Cisco has about 84 percent of Tandberg shares committed to the deal. 
The vendor is looking to take a strong leadership position in the video conferencing space by buying Tandberg. 
Cisco already makes number of video conferencing products, including its TelePresence portfolio 
What Tandberg would give Cisco is a stronger presence in the small and midsize business markets. 
Cisco CEO John Chambers has said that video conferencing is a key piece of the overall $34 billion 
collaboration space. Video conferencing technology can help reduce travel costs for businesses, and companies 
like Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, Verizon and others are using it situations where remote communications makes 
sense, such as enabling doctors to reach patients in rural areas and for remote teaching. 
Cisco on Oct. 1 announced its intent to buy Tandberg for $3 billion, a bid that got the backing of Tandberg's 
board of directors. However, investors that held almost 30 percent of Tandberg stock said the offer was too low 
and that they preferred to see Tandberg stay independent or get a better offer from Cisco or some other 
company. 
Cisco on Nov. 17 upped the bid to almost $3.4 billion and extended the deadline to Dec. 1. It then pushed the 
deadline to Dec. 3.

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) - Behind the scenes, the bad blood was rumored to be at a slow boil. But when 
Hewlett-Packard Co. announced last month it would buy the long-forgotten networking company 3Com Corp., it 
was official. 
The gloves are off. H-P and Cisco Systems Inc. are no longer friends. (RELATED ARTICLE: Hewlett-Packard to 
buy 3Com for $2.7 billion) See H-P to buy 3Com story here. 
The two were previously allies. Their products work together in big data centers and at major corporations. 
Analysts believe the companies had a gentleman's agreement to stay out of each other's turf. But as competition 
fiercer to become the dominant player in the data center has grown fiercer, things changed. Cisco now sells 
rack-mounted servers and H-P is beefing up its networking business. 
In a recent interview, H-P (HPQ, US) senior vice president and head of its networking business, Marius Haas, all 
but declared war on Cisco (CSCO, US). 
"They have already made moves into our space," Haas told MarketWatch, referring to Cisco's entry last year into 
the computer server market. "We are going to be aggressive to make sure we don't just defend, but also attack in 
areas that are core to H-P's strategy." 
Haas' appointment last summer signaled that networking, a key component of the corporate data center, was a 
new focus for H-P. He was named general manager of H-P's ProCurve business, which had been largely ignored 
during former chief Carly Fiorina's reign. But when Mark Hurd took over at H-P, he found the networking business 
a jewel in the rough. 
"We made the conscious decision that this was going to be a strategic business," Haas said, adding that after he 
took on his new role at H-P, the company started some acquisitions in the networking space, to fill out some 
holes. 
One deal was Colubris Networks Inc., a private company developing wireless products for corporate customers. 
Like 3Com (COMS, US), it is based in Waltham, Mass. "We were rapidly going on filling out the rest of the 
portfolio." It was faster than developing more product lines internally, Haas said. 
When asked about H-P's relationship with Cisco, which once had Fiorina on its board, Haas described it as 
"competitive." 
"In my previous role, I was head of corporate strategy and head of mergers and acquisitions," said Haas. "Since I 
have taken on this role, the relationship has changed." 
Haas went on to say that he is not going to speculate what Cisco will or will not do to counter some of H-P's 
recent moves, such as its deal to buy 3Com for $2.7 billion. 
So what will happen next in the stormy relationship between Silicon Valley's two largest companies? It's an 
interesting battle, because their products still need to work together and EDS, now part of H-P's services 
business, has had an alliance with Cisco to provide networking products.

Page 24 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
It's fair to assume that the acquiring is not over for either firm. Both companies have large cash piles, and both 
giants have most of their cash held outside the U.S. In 2009 so far, Cisco announced seven deals, including two 
deals in the $3 billion range. H-P's biggest deal so far this year is its bid to buy 3Com. Last year, it completed its 
mega-deal to buy EDS for nearly $14 billion, a move to expand its services business. 
"If they really go head-to-head with Cisco in networking, the 3Com acquisition is not enough, but they have 
something to work with," said Rajan Varadarajan, a vice president with Primary Global Research LLC in Palo Alto, 
Calif. 
The Wall Street Journal reported that Brocade Communications Systems Inc. (BRCD, US) had quietly put itself 
up for sale and many speculated that H-P was interested. Haas declined to comment on Brocade, but noted that 
in H-P's search process, "we looked and talked to everybody to make sure we were doing the right thing for 
customers." (RELATED ARTICLE: H-P may want Brocade more than tech rivals) See column on Brocade 
speculation. 
Last week, Brocade Chief Executive Michael Klayko told investors during its earnings conference call that the 
company was not for sale. 
Of course, any company is for sale at the right price, but it was an interesting comment nonetheless, coming right 
after H-P's deal to buy 3Com. Brocade is also struggling under more debt after its acquisition of Foundry 
Networks Inc. Still, many on the street are now taking Brocade out of the equation of the most viable takeover 
targets, for now. 
H-P could still do some other networking deals, but Varadarajan pointed out that the company needs to digest its 
other big buys. Its acquisitions of late have been in the realm of tarnished brands, or companies many investors 
forgot about, so it might be hard to come up with realistic candidates. 
Video is another emerging arena of competition between the new foes that could be ripe for more deal activity. 
Last month, Cisco raised its offer to buy Tandberg ASA, a developer of video conferencing systems, to about 
$3.4 billion, after the Norwegian company said its initial offer was insufficient. Tandberg already collaborates with 
H-P to develop a new generation of offerings in the high definition video conferencing arena. (RELATED 
ARTICLE: Cisco lifts Tandberg bid to $3.4 billion) See Cisco ups bid for Tandberg here. 
If Tandberg shareholders approve this deal, it is feasible H-P could strike back with its own deal in video 
conferencing, such as buying Polycom Inc.(PLCM, US) Polycom's shares tumbled over 16% on a disappointing 
quarter in October, but since then, its shares have recouped some losses, as it has been bandied about as a 
possible takeout target as well. 
It doesn't look like there will be any warm and fuzzy holiday greetings exchanged this season by Cisco Systems 
Chief Executive John Chambers and H-P CEO Mark Hurd. 
The bad blood was rumored to be at a slow boil. But when Hewlett-Packard Co. announced last month it would 
buy the long-forgotten networking company 3Com Corp., it was official. H-P and Cisco are no longer friends.

* Most analysts expect deal to close 
* Cisco shares up 2.18 pct (Adds NEW YORK to dateline, background on deal, share move) 
NEW YORK/OSLO, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc on Tuesday extended the offer period to acquire 
Norway's Tandberg by two days to Dec. 3, while maintaining terms for the deal that would create the world's 
leader in videoconferencing equipment. 
It was the third extension to the offer, but most analysts expect shareholders to accept the deal, particularly after 
Cisco raised its bid 10 percent to 19 billion Norwegian crowns ($3.37 billion) in November. 
The latest extension by just two days, some said, also suggested that only administrative issues remained. 
"I think Cisco will succeed," Nordea analyst Andre Adolfsen said. "They would not have extended the offer if they 
had a low acceptance level." 
The original offer by Cisco was rejected by more than 90 percent of Tandberg shareholders. That triggered some 
concerns that the world's biggest network equipment maker may walk away, but most analysts have said the deal 
was too crucial for it to drop. 
Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers has said online videoconferencing was a key growth area that is on the 
brink of more widespread adoption. 
High-quality, real-time videoconferencing can help companies cut travel costs, and Cisco says it can do more, 
such as helping businesses like retailers, banks and hospitals launch services from remote locations. 
Tandberg is the leading videoconferencing equipment maker, and the company's products fill a crucial gap 
between Cisco's high-end TelePresence conferencing products and WebEx desktop video service. Tandberg 
holds 40 percent of the mid-tier market for videoconferencing, according to Wainhouse Research. 
Cisco declined to comment on Tuesday how many Tandberg shareholders had accepted the bid so far, and said 
it will announce results after the new offer period expires. 
The company had initially said it needs 90 percent approval from Tandberg shareholders to close the deal, 
although it later said it could waive that clause. 
Cisco shares were up 51 cents, or 2.18 percent, at $23.91. Tandberg shares closed at 161.40 crowns before the 
bid extension was announced. ($1=5.644 Norwegian crowns) (Reporting by Ritsuko Ando, Wojciech Moskwa and

"We made the conscious decision that this was going to be a strategic business," Haas said, adding that after he 
took on his new role at H-P, the company started some acquisitions in the networking space, to fill out some 
holes. 
One deal was Colubris Networks Inc., a private company developing wireless products for corporate customers. 
Like 3Com, it is based in Waltham, Mass. "We were rapidly going on filling out the rest of the portfolio." It was 
faster than developing more product lines internally, Haas said. 
When asked about H-P's relationship with Cisco, which once had Fiorina on its board, Haas described it as 
"competitive." 
"In my previous role, I was head of corporate strategy and head of mergers and acquisitions," said Haas. "Since I 
have taken on this role, the relationship has changed." 
Haas said he is not going to speculate what Cisco will or will not do to counter some of H-P's recent moves, such 
as its deal to buy 3Com for $2.7 billion. 
So what will happen next in the stormy relationship between Silicon Valley's two largest companies? It's an 
interesting battle, because their products still need to work together and EDS, now part of H-P's services 
business, has had an alliance with Cisco to provide networking products. 
It's fair to assume the acquisition push is not over for either firm. Both companies have large cash piles, and both 
have most of their cash held outside the U.S. In 2009 so far, Cisco has announced seven deals, including two 
deals in the $3 billion range. H-P's biggest deal so far this year is its bid to buy 3Com. Last year, it completed its 
mega-deal to buy EDS for nearly $14 billion, a move to expand its services business.

"If they really go head-to-head with Cisco in networking, the 3Com acquisition is not enough, but they have 
something to work with," said Rajan Varadarajan, a vice president with Primary Global Research LLC in Palo Alto, 
Calif. 
The Wall Street Journal reported that Brocade Communications Systems Inc. (BRCD) had quietly put itself up for 
sale and many speculated that H-P was interested. Haas declined to comment on Brocade, but noted that in 
H-P's search process, "we looked and talked to everybody to make sure we were doing the right thing for 
customers." . 
Last week, Brocade Chief Executive Michael Klayko told investors during its earnings conference call that the 
company was not for sale. 
Of course, any company is for sale at the right price, but it was an interesting comment nonetheless, coming right 
after H-P's deal to buy 3Com. Brocade is also struggling under more debt after its acquisition of Foundry 
Networks Inc. Still, many on the street are taking Brocade out of the equation of the most viable takeover targets, 
for now. 
H-P could still do some other networking deals, but Varadarajan pointed out the company needs to digest its 
other big buys. Its acquisitions of late have been in the realm of tarnished brands, or companies many investors 
forgot about, so it might be hard to come up with realistic candidates. 
Video is another emerging arena of competition between the new foes that could be ripe for more deal activity. 
Last month, Cisco raised its offer to buy Tandberg ASA (TAA.OS), a developer of video-conferencing systems, to 
about $3.4 billion, after the Norwegian company said its initial offer was insufficient. Tandberg already 
collaborates with H-P to develop a new generation of offerings in the high-definition video-conferencing arena. 
If Tandberg shareholders approve this deal, it is feasible H-P could strike back with its own deal in video 
conferencing, such as buying Polycom Inc. (PLCM) Polycom's shares tumbled over 16% on a disappointing 
quarter in October, and has been bandied about as a possible takeout target as well. 
It doesn't look like there will be any warm and fuzzy holiday greetings exchanged this season by Cisco Systems 
Chief Executive John Chambers and H-P CEO Mark Hurd.

OBSERV 
English 
(c) 2009 Electronics International Disclaimer: Whilst every effort has been taken to ensure the accuracy of the 
information contained in this report, neither Electronics International nor its agents or sources can be held 
responsible for any inaccuracy. 
[Editorial Comment: Almost exactly 13 years after the publication by the ITU of the first version of the H323 
architecture that today underpins commercial videoconferencing systems, the videoconferencing market may at 
last be ready to fulfil its long anticipated promise.] [What causes particular potentially huge markets to sleep for a 
generation and then suddenly become mainstream remains something of a mystery, since the process can be 
triggered in so many ways, either from the supply or the demand side through subtle or unexpected shifts in 
technology or market structure in the former case, and by shifts in social patterns, market perception and 
expectations in the latter.] [More often than not it is the slow emergence of a general conviction that there is a 
realistic possibility of a breakthrough in price or technology or market receptivity that finally drives vendors and 
starts capital flowing and consumers licking their lips in unison. 
Certainly it is necessary that some minimal level of synchronisation of expectations take place within an industry 
for there to be a real chance of success.] [The first business videoconferencing systems were launched more 
than a quarter of a century ago, in the mid 1980s, while the first desktop systems were installed in 1994.] 
[According to figures from Wainhouse Research, the value of the videoconferencing market in 1997 was $650 
million, higher than for 2003, when it was estimated at around $550 million, and about the same level as it was in 
2004. Taking into account the fairly high level of internal sales by Cisco from the end of 2006 on, the overall 
market really only developed renewed momentum in 2008.] [Factors that have recently helped to push the market 
towards takeoff include:] [1. Cisco's development of a much higher quality, multi-person, multi-camera, room 
videoconferencing system, which has banished the image of clunky, low quality, low reliability, inflexible systems 
that were previously available. Although these systems are expensive and the market is limited, at least they 
show that a quality solution is possible. The key issue for mass deployment now is not performance but simply 
price.] [2. Cisco's very public enthusiasm (particularly as voiced by CEO John Chambers) for the product, 
manifested by the fact that a high proportion of the market from 2006 to 2008 was Cisco sales to itself. 
Nonetheless, Cisco's unequivocal commitment to the technology has been a wake-up call to the rest of the 
marketplace, whose players realise they risk being upstaged by Cisco if they do not allocate more resources 
themselves to this opportunity.] [3. Paradoxically the downturn has benefited the market by forcing companies to 
cut travel budgets and think about how to improve communications as an alternative. In better times there were 
many factors militating against such a radical shift in work practices.] [4. The growing familiarity of ordinary people 
in developed nations with the use of video and multimedia content generally, including on the move via the mobile 
phone.] [On the face of it this looks to be a huge opportunity for Cisco, and John Chambers has, it seems, 
personally committed himself to promoting this technology more than any other single product the company has 
produced.] [According to Business Week, citing unnamed sources, Cisco will launch at CES in January 2010 a 
$5,000 'consumer' videoconferencing solution. In that context it is worth noting that Cisco is by no means yet a 
mass marketer, even though it has made some modest moves in that direction, and its business model does not 
easily accommodate the level of margins such a product would be likely to earn.] [The prevailing expectation in 
the industry is that despite the recent growth of Cisco's high-end videoconferencing product, it is a limited market 
and the future for videoconferencing lies initially on the desktop and ultimately on the mobile phone. In this sphere 
there are many other companies - particularly HP - that are far better placed than Cisco to develop a global 
market platform.] [As regards building its position in the videoconferencing market and the bid for TANDBERG, 
the general opinion seems to be that Cisco will now gain acceptance from the majority of TANDBERG 
shareholders following its latest offer - which, the company noted, represents an 11.0% premium on the previous 
day closing price of TANDBERG stock.] [From a tactical point of view it is understandable that Cisco should say 
that this was its final offer. However, Cisco has described its proposed takeover of TANDBERG as "very 
strategic" and is unlikely to walk away from such an opportunity for the want of a few hundred million dollars.] 
[Cisco has given the remaining shareholders until December 1 to make their final decision, a carefully judged 
period that neither suggests that Cisco is worried about the outcome nor presents the remaining shareholders 
with too abrupt an ultimatum.] [It would certainly be something of a disaster if the latest offer were turned down, 
which is surely still a possibility given the way Cisco has talked up the market opportunity and the fact that the 
market generally is recovering.] [Attention now shifts to the responses of the rest of the market, none of whom

Page 29 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
seem to be interested in fighting for TANDBERG, although any potential bidders may be waiting to see how 
acceptances are going for the latest offer before showing their hand.] [Regarding the competition, this is likely to 
include:] [i. HP: this company entered the high-end videoconferencing market in 2005, ahead of Cisco, but has 
not been an evangelist for the product line, bought large numbers for its own use, nor spent much on advertising. 
For the first quarter of 2009, Wainhouse Research put HP with 10-11% of the $450-500 million high-end sector of 
the market, against 67% held by Cisco.] [In May 2009, HP moved its videoconferencing business from its printer 
to its networking division and has also started selling videoconferencing products from other companies. 
However, given that its products are said to be more expensive than Cisco's that does not seem an adequate 
response, although its planned acquisition of 3Com will strengthen its videoconferencing capability to some 
extent.] [ii. IBM: primarily a solutions provider to corporate customers, historically IBM has marketed Cisco's 
TelePresence products as part of larger solutions. The company's emphasis on videoconferencing specifically is 
difficult to estimate, but IBM sees the technology as a subset of the unified communications approach. In June 
2009 IBM signed an expanded alliance with Avaya for unified communications products.] [iii. Microsoft: stemming 
from its PC background, the company's approach is understandably to provide software to individuals which 
enables them to videoconference on a one to one or one to many basis.] [iv. Motorola: on November 16, Motorola 
announced that it planned to acquire BitBand for integration into its Home & Networks Mobility business. BitBand 
specialises in VoD for IPTV and claims over 60 IPTV deployments worldwide, including with Tele2 (Holland), 
Fastweb (Italy) and Swyazinvest (Russia).] [v. Polycom: once TANDBERG is acquired, $1.95 billion-capitalised 
Polycom of Pleasanton, California claims it will be the largest 'independent' supplier of videoconferencing 
systems, which it believes will aid its collaboration efforts. For the quarter ended September 30, 2009 Polycom 
reported sales of $243.0 million and a GPM of 56.9%.] [The company operates in three units - Video Solutions, 
Voice Communications Solutions and Services - and claims to have shipped nearly one-million videoconferencing 
systems and more than 50,000 telepresence solutions to customers including Turner Broadcasting Systems, 
Georgetown University, Nasdaq, Duke University, Amgen, Zurich Financial and Oklahoma Army National Guard.] 
[Polycom quotes Wainhouse Research as ranking it the global leader for total installed group systems as of July 
2009, with an estimated 41% share, and also ranking Polycom the leading supplier for global videoconferencing 
systems in first half of 2009 with a 35% share.] [vi. Teliris: with twin HQs in London and New York, the company 
claims deployments in over 50 countries and the largest installed base of Global 2000 companies, including with 
Unilever, British American Tobacco, Lazard, Pearson, GlaxoSmithKline, Royal Bank of Scotland and Merck. 
Teliris offers a 99%+ availability guarantee for its solutions and claims interoperability with Cisco TelePresence, 
Tandberg Total Telepresence and Polycom RealPresence.] [In mid-2009 the company announced its sixth 
generation product, an 'agile' standards-based client-server software solution designed to deliver telepresence 
through general purpose networks; Teliris said it had received orders for 130 rooms in the first 30 days of general 
availability. At the same time the company announced the Teliris NanoPersonal Telepresence product, a 
dedicated telepresence appliance for the desktop priced at under $8,000.] [vii. LogiTech: on November 10, 2009 
LogiTech, a $3.11 billion-capitalised Swiss company traditionally known as a supplier of PC accessories, 
announced that it had made a $405 million bid for privately held LifeSize Communications of Austin, Texas, a 
start-up developer of HD videoconferencing systems with more than 9,000 enterprise, education and government 
customers in 80 countries.] [LogiTech apparently believes it can apply its efficient manufacturing techniques to 
producing LifeSize products more cheaply and create a mass market for such systems.]

Cisco Systems Inc. raised its bid for Tandberg ASA to 19 billion kroner ($3.4 bln), after the Norwegian company's 
shareholders said the first offer for the second- largest maker of videoconferencing systems was too little. 
Cisco boosted its offer by about 11 percent to 170 kroner a share after its earlier offer of 153.5 kroner a share 
garnered just 9.4 percent of Tandberg's shares. The company said it is extending the offer period to Dec. 1. 
"The new offer represents the final price for this transaction," Cisco said in a statement. If the company doesn't 
get the necessary acceptance, it will walk away and look for other ways to grow in videoconferencing, it said. 
Cisco's raised offer reflects the company's drive to expand in videoconferencing. Cisco wants a larger share of a 
"collaboration" market that's worth about $34 billion according to Chief Executive Officer John Chambers. 
Folketrygdfondet, Norway's domestic pension fund and Tandberg's largest shareholder with a 10.09 percent 
stake, said it would accept the new offer. Tandberg rose as much as 6.3 percent in Oslo to 167.5 kroner. 
On Nov. 10, Cisco said it first offer had acceptance from investors holding 7.9 million shares and was in a position 
to acquire a total of 10.5 million shares, amounting to about 9.4 percent of the company. 
Both Tandberg and Cisco make high-end "telepresence" rooms where participants interact with life-sized, highdefinition 
images of their counterparts. The systems cost as much as $300,000 and are sold as a substitute for 
executive travel. Tandberg also makes less-expensive systems that appeal to smaller companies.

San Francisco--Networking giant Cisco Systems on Monday raised its offer to buy Norwegian video 
communications company Tandberg by 11 percent - to $3.41 billion - after the company's previous bid failed to 
win sufficient support from Tandberg shareholders. 
Cisco said that the bid was its last offer and required 90 percent of Tandberg shareholders to accept the deal by 
Dec 1 or it would be withdrawn. 
Some 40 per cent of Tandberg shareholders had accepted the previous bid which was tendered last month. That 
all-cash deal represented an 11-percent premium on Tandberg's closing price and was recommended 
unanimously by Tandberg's board. 
The possible deal would represent Cisco's first purchase of a public company outside the US. 
The deal underscores Cisco's long term goal of dominating the market for online video conferencing technology, 
which Cisco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Chambers described as a $34-billion market "and 
rapidly growing". 
Cisco already has a successful line of high end video-conferencing known as TelePresence systems. Tandberg 
offers smaller-sized, cheaper systems and specialized software for managing video conferencing systems and for 
creating connections between systems that rely on different underlying technologies. 
"Cisco and Tandberg have remarkably similar cultures and a share dvision to change the way the world works 
through collaboration and video communications technologies," said Chambers. "Collaboration is a $34-billion 
market and is growing rapidly. This acquisition showcases Cisco's financial strength and ability to quickly capture 
key market transitions for growth."

Cisco Systems Inc. raised its bid for Tandberg ASA 10 per cent to 19 billion Norwegian crowns ($3.41 billion 
U.S.), a move widely expected to win over shareholders of the video conferencing company. 
Cisco said on Monday its new bid of 170 crowns per share had the approval of holders of more than 40 per cent 
of Tandberg shares, including the top two investors, OppenheimerFunds, which had opposed the original offer, 
and Folketrygdfondet. Less than 10 per cent of shareholders had accepted Cisco's initial 153.50-crown bid. 
Tandberg's board, which had supported the original price, called the sweetened offer "outstanding." 
Norwegian conglomerate Orkla, which holds 2.2 per cent of Tandberg stock, viewed the new price positively. "We 
had thought that 153.50 was too low, but 170 is something we will evaluate thoroughly, and there's a good 
chance we will accept ...," said Ole Dahl, a portfolio manager at Orkla. 
The raised bid also confirmed widespread views that the deal was too important for Cisco to drop. Cisco CEO 
John Chambers has touted online videoconferencing as a key growth area that is on the brink of more 
widespread adoption. 
High-quality, real-time videoconferencing can help companies cut travel costs, and Cisco says it can do more, 
such as helping businesses like retailers, banks and hospitals launch services from remote locations. 
Tandberg is the leading videoconferencing equipment maker, and its products complement Cisco's high-end 
TelePresence conferencing products and its WebEx desktop video service. The Norwegian company holds 40 
per cent of the mid-tier market for videoconferencing, according to Wainhouse Research. 
Cisco said the new tender offer would expire on Dec. 1 and indicated it could waive its previous requirement that 
the deal win support from holders of 90 per cent of Tandberg shares. 
The new offer values Tandberg at around 21 times forecast fiscal 2010 earnings, according to Thomson Reuters 
I/B/E/S. The No. 2 videoconferencing equipment maker, Polycom Inc, was trading at around 18 times forecast 
earnings. 
Panta Capital, a London firm advising on merger arbitrage that had called the initial bid too low, said the new offer 
was fair and likely to win favour with investors it represented. "I think it's a done deal now," Panta's Peter 
Germonpre said. 
Even analysts who have a higher price target on Tandberg shares said the new bid would probably win 
shareholder approval. 
"This still undervalues Tandberg, which is worth 180 crowns on a stand-alone basis and at least 200 with a 
takeover premium," said Arild Nysaether, analyst at Fondsfinans. "But it is an improvement and stands a fair 
chance of coming through." 
Cisco has been been stepping up dealmaking to broaden its product portfolio and provide for all of customers' IT 
needs.

STOCKHOLM -- Cisco Systems Inc. raised its cash bid for Tandberg ASA of Norway to 19 billion Norwegian 
kroner ($3.39 billion) and said Monday its offer was final. 
"The new offer represents the offeror's final price for this transaction," Cisco said, adding that it will withdraw the 
bid if it doesn't achieve the desired 90% level of acceptances. 
The U.S.-based network-equipment supplier increased its offer to 170 kroner a share from 153.50 kroner a share 
and extended the offer period to Dec. 1. 
Tandberg's board of directors unanimously recommended the revised bid, Chairman Jan Opsahl said in a 
statement. "We believe this is an outstanding offer for our shareholders," Mr. Opsahl said. 
Cisco said it has received acceptances representing at least 40% of Tandberg's shares, including from the 
largest shareholders: Folketrygdfondet and Oppenheimer Funds. 
Peter Germonpre, managing director at minority Tandberg shareholder Panta Capital, said that he will accept the 
new offer, which he described as satisfactory but "not a knock-out bid." 
Panta Capital, which owns less than 1% of Tandberg's shares, had said in an open letter on Nov. 6 that the 
previous bid was too low. 
In early October, Cisco offered to buy the video-conferencing-equipment maker for 153.50 kroner a share, which 
valued the company at about $3.08 billion. 
The offer represented an 11% premium to Tandberg's share price on Sept. 30 and a 38% premium to the price 
on July 15 before reports emerged about a coming bid. 
Tandberg management also supports the deal. 
Several minority shareholders in Tandberg had rejected the original offer. 
Swedish brokerage SEB Enskilda said Oct. 15 that owners of 24% of Tandberg's shares, which it represented, 
had turned down the bid claiming that the premium was too low. 
Last week, Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., extended the offer deadline to Nov. 18 in an effort to lure in 
remaining hold-outs seeking a richer bid. 
The company has pushed into 30 new business areas, including videoconferencing systems, which it says could 
each produce $1 billion a year in revenue. 
The raised bid from Cisco looks fair and will probably be accepted by Tandberg's owners, said Arctic Securities 
analyst Tom Olav Holberg, who noted that several big shareholders already have accepted the new offer. 
TandbergChief Executive Fredrik Halvorsen said the offer reflected Cisco's support of Tandberg's technology. 
"We continue to believe that Cisco and Tandberg share a vision of changing the way people communicate and 
collaborate, and that the combination of world-class technologies, Cisco's global scale, and exceptional people 
from both organizations will enable us to accelerate innovation and market adoption," Mr. Halvorsen said.

Cisco's Chief Executive, John Chambers, has said that he will move supervision of Cisco's telepresence 
business under Mr. Halvorsen. 
"Fredrik has almost an unlimited blank check," Mr. Chambers said on a conference call last month. "This isn't a 
matter of synergies or cutting costs." 
Tandberg shares, which were halted on the Oslo exchange Monday ahead of the announcement, rose 3.6% to 
close at 163.20 kroner, outperforming a 1.1% rise in the broader market.

Cisco Systems Inc. raised its bid for Tandberg ASA to $3.6 billion, after the Norwegian company's shareholders 
said its offer for the world's second-biggest video conferencing systems maker was too little. 
Cisco said it will pay $32 a share, or about 11 per cent more, after its offer of $29 a share garnered just 9.4 per 
cent of Tandberg's shares. The company said it now has commitments of more than 40 per cent of shares and is 
extending the offer to Dec. 1. 
"The fact they now have a pre-acceptance level of 40 per cent increases the likelihood the bid will go through," 
said First Securities ASA analyst Ole Joergen Roed, who recommends investors buy the shares. 
Cisco requires 90 per cent of shares to carry through the offer. Its raised offer reflects the company's drive to 
expand in video conferencing, with the "collaboration" market worth about $34 billion, according to CEO John 
Chambers. Folketrygdfondet, Norway's domestic pension fund and Tandberg's largest shareholder with a 10.09 
per cent stake, said it would accept the new offer. Tandberg said other large shareholders had also committed to 
tender their shares. 
Tandberg rose as much as 6.3 per cent in Oslo to $31.67 and was trading at $30.84 at 3:36 p.m. The company 
traded at $26.07 on Sept. 30, before the offer. Cisco gained three cents to $23.74 on the Nasdaq at 9:36 a.m. 
New York time. 
"The new offer represents the final price for this transaction," Cisco, the world's largest maker of networking 
equipment, said. 
If the company doesn't get the necessary acceptance, it will walk away and look for other ways to grow in video 
conferencing, it said.

With the deadline approaching for closing Cisco's $3 billion offer to acquire Tandberg, Cisco said it will consider 
dropping its offer if Tandberg stockholders don't vote for the takeover in significant numbers. 
Cisco has extended its offer to 5:30 p.m. Nov. 18, at which time it will announce whether at least 90% of 
Tandberg stock has been tendered. Norwegian laws require at least 90% of stockholders to approve acquisitions. 
"Soon after expiration of the extended offer period," Cisco said in a release, "Cisco will announce whether the 
90% condition for the offer has been met. If not, Cisco will evaluate whether or not to withdraw the offer." 
With Cisco making a big commitment to videoconferencing and telepresence applications, Tandberg would 
represent an important asset for Cisco's drive in the area. On the other hand, it believes its $3 billion offer for 
Tandberg is fair and points to a recent Ernst and Young analysis that found the offer was a fair deal for Tandberg 
stockholders. 
A group of Tandberg stockholders, representing about 24% of the Norwegian firm's total shareholder population, 
has been holding out for an 11% increase over the $3 billion figure. The higher price would represent a 50% 
increase over Tandberg's stock price when reports of a possible acquisition began circulating. 
Cisco CEO John Chambers has hailed an acquisition of Tandberg because the two firms have similar cultures. 
Tandberg's chief executive Fredrik Halvorsen has also supported the merger along with the remainder of 
Tandberg's top management. The Ernst & Young report was commissioned by Tandberg management. 
Another problem for Cisco in agreeing to a higher bid is that the acquisition-happy firm fears it could set a 
precedent for other deals, which could become routinely challenged by stockholders seeking additional money 
after a deal has been struck.

Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) on Tuesday again said it would consider withdrawing its offer for Tandberg (TAA.OS) 
if the tech giant does not reach the 90% mark for tendered shares. 
The San Jose, Calif.-based networking gear maker, shares of which were down more than 1%, said only 9.4% of 
the Norwegian video-conferencing firm's shares have been tendered as of Tuesday. 
Cisco's $3 billion merger deal with Tandberg has been opposed by some of the company's holders who are 
pushing for a higher price. 
However, Cisco's chief strategy officer, Ned Hooper, said in a blog post last week that the company will 'always 
act with fiscal prudence' in its bid for Tandberg, highlighting the possibility that the company was prepared to drop 
the deal. 
Chief Executive John Chambers said he would be willing to walk away from any deal, without specifically 
mentioning Tandberg, if the price was deemed unattractive. 
Cisco extended the deadline for the offer period to Nov. 18. The company said that 'soon after' that date Cisco 
'will announce whether the 90% condition for the offer has been met. If not, Cisco will evaluate whether or not to 
withdraw the offer.' 
Cisco has won rave reviews recently, after posting upbeat results and a bold bid to expand its reach into other 
arenas, marked by a series of acquisitions. 
In a Tuesday note, Ticonderoga analyst Brian White noted that 'since the beginning of October, Cisco has been 
operating at a furious pace with four acquisitions announced, a coalition and joint venture agreement for 
virtualization solutions signed, a $5 billion debt offering priced and a host of new product announcements. If there 
is any company that can teach other organizations how to operate efficiently through collaboration and 
technology, we believe it is Cisco.' 
Also on Monday, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Steven O'Brien wrote, 'We are now more confident Cisco 
reached a demand tipping point irrespective of our longer-term concerns over competition and technology 
substitution.'

Cisco Systems officials will wait another week before deciding what to do with their $3 billion bid to buy video 
conferencing company Tandberg. 
Cisco, which had set an initial deadline of Nov. 9 for shareholders to accept the deal, has pushed that deadline to 
Nov. 18. Cisco is looking to get 90 percent of Tandberg shares before moving forward with the deal. 
In a brief statement Nov. 10, Cisco said it had received acceptances from investors representing 9.37 percent of 
Tandberg shares. 
In the statement, Cisco officials said they will decide soon after the Nov. 18 deadline passes whether they had 
gotten the 90 percent of shares they are looking for. If not, they will decide whether to withdraw the offer. 
Cisco announced the $3 billion offer Oct. 1, and the Tandberg board of directors is supporting it. The deal would 
give Cisco a greater share of the video conferencing market, which company officials say is a key part of a $34 
billion opportunity in the overall collaboration market. 
However, over the past few weeks, a number of organizations representing almost 30 percent of Tandberg 
shares have said they will not accept the Cisco bid, which they say is too low. They would rather see Tandberg 
stay independent, or for Cisco or another company to increase the offer. 
In an open letter to Cisco Nov. 6, Panta Capital and Scott & Associates chided Cisco for asking too low a price for 
Tandberg, for ignoring the stock price increases for both Tandberg and rival Polycom in the months leading up to 
Cisco's Oct. 1 bid, and for not taking into account Tandberg's operational successes. 
Cisco has called its offer fair, and during a meeting with analysts and reporters following his company's quarterly 
financial report Nov. 4, Cisco CEO John Chambers said he was confident the deal would get done, but also said 
he was confident Cisco would do well in the market even without Tandberg. 
Analysts have said if Tandberg shareholders reject the $3 billion bid then Cisco will have little choice but to raise 
the offer.

Among the shares I hold in my portfolio tracked by "Globes" is Radvision Ltd. (Nasdaq: RVSN; TASE: RVSN), 
which last week showed signs of life after its "death blow" of October 1st, when Cisco, which represents 40% of 
Radvision's sales, announced its intention to buy Norway's Tandberg, the leader in enterprise video conferencing 
systems. 
On Thursday, Radvision's share nearly hit $7, a 25% rise from its $5.60 low, reached in the past two weeks. Two 
possible reasons I see for the jump are the continuing difficulties in the Cisco-Tandberg deal, and several Cisco 
announcements that involve Radvision technology. 
Tandberg shareholders have not run to accept Cisco's offer price of 153.30 kroner. It has been hard to forecast 
Cisco's response to a refusal, since as far as I remember, Cisco executives never encountered shareholder 
opposition to a price agreed upon with a company's board, and they have done tens, if not hundreds, of deals. 
Cisco did not anticipate the opposition, and apparently that is why it aimed for this week as the time to announce 
a whole set of new launches in the communications sector, from email, through social networks at companies, to 
more advanced video systems. Cisco hoped to see Tandberg as part of the puzzle that the launches complete, 
as these products strengthen its standing as a wall to wall provider of all a company's communications needs. 
Essentially, Cisco also indirectly announced the deepening of its competition against giants Microsoft, IBM, and 
HP a continuation of its entrance earlier this year into the server and storage sector, putting it into head to head 
competition with IBM and HP. 
The ideal scenario for Radvison is for Cisco to drop its Tandberg bid, which would lead to stronger ties between 
Radvision and Cisco, and possibly even a Radvision acquisition by Cisco. That's because for Cisco CEO John 
Chambers, video has become an obsession. For example, last week, after a post-results interview on Fox, 
Chambers kidded his interviewer about a recent football game. Chambers pulled out a Flip compact video 
camera, made by a firm that Cisco bought, and recommended that the interviewer buy one, film the next game, 
and send by a built-in UBS connection, with no cable to connect, to a computer, and from there to his friends 
through the Internet. 
More than a few of Cisco's recent announcements are based on Radvision developments. For example, when 
Cisco says that its expensive TelePresence systems can communicate with the lower end systems of Tandberg 
or Polycom which are found in nearly every meeting room in organizations, it's because of components which 
Radvision developed for it. When Cisco announces video communications between its WebEx systems and 
TelePresence, it is also because Radvision put in the components in Cisco's WebEx systems, which until recently 
were based on data and voice without video. 
If the Cisco-Tandberg deal does eventually go through (Cisco extended the deadline for the offer to November 
18th), Radvision faces two scenarios. The first, more likely one, is a gradual separation from Cisco, and a closer 
relationship with one of the other giants in the sector, such as HP, and/or a deepening collaboration with 
Samsung. In the current quarter, Samsung began to sell a tabletop video system for enterprise employees, based 
on a Samsung 24-inch monitor and Radvision video communications components. 
The second possible scenario, though less likely, is that Cisco won't give up its current strong connections with 
Radvision, and will find a way to continue to buy the Radvision equipment for its high-end systems and for WebEx 
systems that Tandberg is nearly not in at all.

Cisco this week said is extending the acceptance period for its $3 billion cash offer to acquire Tandberg to Nov. 
18. The initial acceptance deadline was Nov. 9. 
The terms and conditions set out in the offer document remain in place during the extended offer period, Cisco 
said. Cisco's facing pressure from shareholders owning about 30% of Tandberg to raise its offer. 
The board of Tandberg unanimously recommended on Oct. 1 that shareholders accept Cisco's offer, which Cisco 
says represents a 38% premium on the price of Tandberg stock as of July 15. But in addition to the opposition 
from shareholders owning 30% of the company, two investment firms with a stake in Tandberg issued an open 
letter to Cisco CEO John Chambers and Senior Vice President Ned Hooper detailing why Cisco's offer did not 
reflect Tandberg's value. 
Tandberg is the leading vendor in videoconferencing. Cisco said Tandberg's products would help it fill out its 
mid-range and desktop videoconferencing portfolio -- Cisco's own TelePresence systems occupy the high end -- 
and also enhance its offerings in the $30 billion collaboration market.

* Cisco gets 9.4 percent acceptances for Tandberg offer

By Joergen Frich and Ritsuko Ando 
OSLO/NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Over 90 percent of shareholders in Norwegian videoconferencing 
company Tandberg snubbed an acquisition bid by U.S. network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc , with many 
expecting a sweetened offer. 
Cisco revealed the tally of responses from Tandberg shareholders on Tuesday, showing only 9.37 percent 
acceptance, a day after announcing it would extend its 17.2-billion-Norwegian-crown ($3.1 billion) offer to Nov. 18 
while keeping the terms unchanged. [ID:nL9496256] 
Groups representing a total of around 30 percent of Tandberg shareholders have publicly demanded a higher 
offer than Cisco's price of 153.5 crowns a share. Cisco needs 90 percent approval to close the deal, which 
analysts say would create a strong leader in video communications. 
Analysts said Cisco could ultimately offer around 160 to 170 crowns. 
"This confirms what we have believed for a while ... the big majority wants to wait and see how this develops," 
said analyst Tore Tonseth from Argo Securities. "There's no point in accepting, when you see that 20-30 percent 
of shares are not accepting." 
Cisco said on Tuesday if it does not win 90 percent acceptance by the new deadline, it will evaluate whether to 
withdraw the offer. 
The company has said its offer is a "fair price" representing a 38.3 percent premium to the closing share price on 
July 15, before the media reported a possible deal. Tandberg's board of directors have also backed the offer. 
Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said last week that he believed the deal will close. But he also raised the 
prospect of walking away, saying that there was no such thing as a "must have" deal and that Cisco needs to be 
financially prudent. 
Few analysts, however, expect Cisco to drop its bid as it has repeatedly touted online videoconferencing as a key 
growth area. 
Most expect a higher offer. Strong quarterly results from Tandberg also supported those calling for a higher offer, 
analysts said. 
"A range of 160-170 (crowns) is a natural place to go to," Argo's Tonseth said. "A lot has happened since Cisco 
made the offer. The market has rallied, and Tandberg has delivered strong results." 
Ole Joergen Roed, analyst at First Securities, said Cisco was unlikely to win a substantially higher acceptance in 
the extended period, and that Cisco will probably increase the offer price. 
"They will have to go to at least 170 crowns," he said

Page 44 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
He also noted the possibility of a rival suitor, such as Microsoft Corp , Hewlett-Packard Co , International 
Business Machines Corp , or Avaya [AVXX.UL]. 
No company has yet publicly shown interest in Tandberg. But analysts have said that regardless of whether and 
how the Cisco-Tandberg deal closes, it could trigger more transactions involving videoconferencing companies 
like No. 2 player Polycom Inc . Hewlett-Packard also offers high-end video conferencing. 
Cisco could keep extending the deadline and continue to negotiate with shareholders for a maximum of 10 
weeks, or until mid-December. 
Tandberg shares were little changed at 151.5 crowns by 0910 GMT. (Additional reporting by Richard Solem and

Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) is extending the acceptance period for its US$3bn bid for Norwegian video 
conferencing company Tandberg by nine days to November 18, the company said in a statement. 
"The terms and conditions set out in the offer document remain in place during the extended offer period," Cisco 
said. 
The one-month tender offer was due to expire on Monday. 
CEO John Chambers was reported last week as saying he believed the Tandberg deal would be closed, but 
threatened to drop the offer after investors holding about 30% of Tandberg shares demanded a higher price than 
the 153.50 Norwegian krones (US$27.31) per share offered by Cisco. 
Cisco made its offer for Tandberg conditional on 90% acceptance. 
The move is a clear attempt by Cisco to consolidate its position in the video conferencing business. In October, 
Cisco announced plans to acquire IP mobile solutions provider Starent Networks (Nasdaq: STAR).

By Roger Cheng 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), unable to sway all of Tandberg ASA's (TAA.OS) 
shareholders with its $3.03 billion offer for the video conferencing company, on Monday extended the deadline in 
an effort to lure the remaining hold-outs seeking a richer bid. 
The San Jose networking titan has maintained that it is offering a "full and fair" price for Tandberg, based in 
Norway. But a minority group of Tandberg shareholders have complained the price is too low. Cisco's deal values 
Tandberg at 153.50 Norwegian kroner per share; Tandberg shareholder Panta Capital told Dow Jones 
Newswires last week that an acceptable bid price would be at least NOK170. 
The offer period, which was expected to expire Monday, was extended to Nov. 18. All terms and conditions 
remain in place, according to Cisco. The company wanted to buy up all of the shares, but had a 90% "threshold" 
that likely wasn't met. 
In early October, Cisco offered to buy the video-conferencing-equipment maker in a deal that values the company 
at around 17.2 billion Norwegian kroner ($3.08 billion). The offer represents an 11% premium to Tandberg's 
share price Sept. 30 and a 38% premium to the price on July 15 before reports emerged about an upcoming bid. 
Tandberg's board and management also support the deal. 
But investment firm Panta Capital and advisory firm Scott & Associates AG said in an open letter that the current 
offer doesn't adequately reflect Tandberg's operational performance or the valuation of its peers. 
Last week, Cisco reported its fiscal first-quarter profit dropped 19% as lower sales offset improved margins, and 
the company noted strong sequential trends and that the economic outlook has improved. Against a backdrop of 
greater merger activity, Cisco also agreed to acquire Starent Networks Corp. (STAR) last month. 
Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers reiterated to analysts that the offer was fair, and noted that he would be 
willing to walk away from any deals if the price was no longer attractive. 
"Cisco's general approach to M&A activities is that no acquisition should be pursued or completed if it runs 
counter to the broader principles of prudence and financial fairness," a Cisco spokeswoman said Monday. 
Tandberg plays into the company's burgeoning video conferencing business, which is one of the 30 new 
business areas that Chambers most often talks about. The company has been acquiring businesses to augment 
those new ventures. 
Earlier Monday, Cisco said it as offering a three-part bond deal worth at least $1 billion, which it intends to use for 
general corporate purposes. The company has $10.3 billion in long-term debt as of July, according to a filing with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Cisco shares fell 0.1% to $23.80.

Two investment consulting companies laid out objections to Cisco Systems' $3 billion offer for Norwegian 
videoconferencing vendor Tandberg, saying in an open letter to Cisco and a press interview that the bid 
undervalues Tandberg. 
Cisco and Tandberg announced the deal on Oct. 1, but it still needs to be approved by Tandberg's shareholders. 
The agreement requires owners of 90% of the company's shares to sign off on the acquisition by Nov. 9. 
According to recent media reports, holders of 24%% of Tandberg stock don't plan to accept the deal. Cisco 
suggested on Monday that it might drop its offer rather than raise it. 
Acquiring Tandberg, one of the major suppliers of videoconferencing equipment, would expand Cisco's already 
strong position in technology for virtual meetings. Cisco has high-definition, immersive videoconferencing systems 
in its Telepresence line as well as desktop collaboration offerings in its WebEx line. Chairman and CEO John 
Chambers has said video is the key application that will shape communications and drive network infrastructure 
growth in the coming years. 
Panta Capital Managing Director Peter Germonpre said in an interview that Cisco would have to offer at least 170 
Norwegian Kroner per share, about 11% above the current bid of 153.5 Kroner, according to a Wall Street Journal 
report. Germonpre reportedly said Panta and investment consultants Scott & Associates own less than 1% of 
Tandberg but have heard other shareholders take the same view. 
In an open letter on behalf of Tandberg shareholders, addressed to Chambers and Chief Strategy Officer Ned 
Hooper, Panta and Scott said Cisco isn't offering enough of a premium. 
Among other things, the consultants said Tandberg's third-quarter financial results beat the consensus estimates 
of analysts for revenue and profit. In addition, they said estimates of the company's 2009 results have fallen by 
only about 9 percent, outperforming estimates for the technology sector and for Tandberg rival Polycom, which 
fell between about 30 percent and 45 percent. They said Cisco is valuing Tandberg on a par with Polycom while 
the Norwegian company is actually outperforming its competitor. 
When the deal was announced, Cisco said its offer represented a 38.3 percent premium over Tandberg's share 
price on July 15, which Cisco said was just before the company's stock started to rise because of takeover 
speculation. Panta and Scott rejected that argument, saying Tandberg had been seen as a takeover target 
before then. 
Cisco representatives could not immediately be reached for comment.

* Launches $5 bln three-part debt sale 
* Cisco cash rich, but most of it overseas 
* Cisco stepping up M&A, plans to buy Starent for $2.9 bln (Adds background on Cisco's M&A strategy, analyst 
comment) 
NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Top U.S. network equipment maker Cisco Systems on Monday launched a $5 
billion three-part debt sale, showing the company replenishing its war chest as it steps up acquisitions. 
While Cisco is cash rich, with $35.4 billion in cash and investments at the end of the last quarter, most of it was 
overseas as a result of its global operations, with only $4.7 billion held in the United States. 
"Moving cash into the United States from international geographies might trigger adverse tax implications, so a 
debt raise could make sense," said Taunya Sell, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie, a division of Wells Fargo, in a 
note to clients. 
She said proceeds were likely to be used to fund Cisco's planned acquisition of wireless equipment maker Starent 
Networks Corp for $2.9 billion. 
Cisco has said it plans more acquisitions ahead. It is also planning to buy Norwegian videoconferencing company 
Tandberg ASA , although that deal will use overseas cash. 
IFR, a Thomson Reuters service, said the latest offering consists of $500 million of five-year notes launched at 67 
basis points more than comparable U.S. Treasuries, and $2.5 billion of 10-year notes launched at 100 basis 
points more than Treasuries. 
The third part is $2 billion of 30-year bonds launched at 130 basis points more than Treasuries. 
Acquisitions have been a key part of Cisco's growth strategy over the past decade, and the company has 
expanded from routers and switches to a wider range of products like cable set-top boxes and business software. 
Since John Chambers took the CEO role in 1995, it has grown from $1.2 billion in annual revenue to around $40 
billion. 
Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are the active lead managers, and Bank of America, HSBC and 
JPMorgan are the passive lead managers, said IFR. (Reporting by Pam Niimi and Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Diane

Cisco launched a series of collaboration products Monday, encompassing telepresence, unified communications, 
and Cisco WebEx solutions. 
At the same time, the company extended its acceptance period to Nov. 18 for its planned $3 billion acquisition of 
Tandberg, which would likely contribute key building blocks to Cisco's videoconferencing and telepresence 
applications. 
Cisco's collaboration products and services take the company far from its traditional routers and switches 
business and towards CEO John Chambers' vision of embracing video and other voice applications to enable 
person-to-person and business-to-business collaboration across a wide range of media technologies and devices. 
"Cisco's new collaboration experience enables innovative ways of working," said Tony Bates, senior VP and 
general manager of enterprise, commercial, and small business at Cisco, in a statement. "They can be deployed 
in any order and at a pace that matches a company's business imperatives." 
Cisco also moved into two new markets Monday -- enterprise social software and hosted e-mail solutions -- as it 
exploited some of its recent acquisitions. The Cisco Show and Share social video system helps organizations 
record, edit, and share videos and associated add-ons like RSS feeds and tagging. Speech-to-text transcripts can 
be uploaded in the application. 
Cisco WebEx Mail, utilizing technology from recent acquisition PostPath, features interoperability with Microsoft 
Outlook and AJAX Web 2.0 access. The on-demand WebEx Mail is highly scalable and overcomes traditional 
mailbox size limitations. 
Cisco's unified communications offerings cut across many of the products unveiled Monday. Its Cisco Unified 
Communications system 8.0 includes new video- and Wi-Fi-enabled Cisco Unified IP Phones as well as 
additional smartphones through Cisco Unified Mobile Communicator. 
Also, Cisco Pulse, a search engine that traverses networks, carries out dynamic tagging of content. The real-time 
cross application view of an organization's networks enables users to locate and rapidly connect with the people 
and information they need. 
Cisco did not mention Tandberg in its announcement, although it likely has big plans for the company's 
videoconferencing products if the acquisition goes through. Cisco did note however that it was extending its 
telepresence and online video applications with Cisco TelePresence WebEx Engage. Cisco also introduced its 
TelePresence Directory of endpoints including more than 80 customers already using intercompany Cisco 
TelePresence. 
The Tandberg acquisition has been held up because a minority group of Tandberg stockholders is seeking to get 
Cisco to increase its acquisition price at least 11%. Tandberg's directors and top management have approved 
Cisco's offer, which is 38% higher than the price of Tandberg stock when reports first surfaced of a potential 
acquisition. Norwegian laws require that 90% of a firm's stockholders vote in favor of any Norwegian company's 
acquisition, giving leverage to the 24% of stockholders holding out for a higher price.

More Opposition to Cisco Tandberg Bid Rises

Cisco Systems is seeing growing resistance to its $3 billion bid for video conferencing systems vendor Tandberg. 
Panta Capital, a London-based financial firm that represents some Tandberg shareholders, and Scott & 
Associates, a Swiss firm, have both said the offer Cisco is making for Tandberg is too low. 
In an open letter to Cisco posted on Panta's Website Nov. 6, the two firms question why Cisco officials use 
Tandberg's closing stock price of July 15 as the comparison point for the $3 billion bid, which the networking 
giant announced Oct. 1. Cisco officials have said they used the July date because it was when speculation about 
Cisco buying Tandberg first began circulating, and the $3 billion represents a 38.3 percent premium over the 
stock price of that day. 
However, Panta and Scott said Tandberg had been talked about as a takeover target for the past 18 months by 
not only Cisco but others, including Silver Lake Partners. They also argued that Cisco had not taken into account 
the fact that the stock prices of both Tandberg and its rival, Polycom, had risen significantly between July 15 and 
Oct. 1, a reflection of business strength beyond the takeover rumors. 
Cisco has not taken into account historical trading value, peer valuation and operational performance, the two 
firms said. 
In addition, given that Cisco officials have said video conferencing is a key part of the $34 billion collaboration 
market opportunity envisioned by Cisco officials, and that Tandberg could see its revenues grow faster as part of 
Cisco, the $3 billion is too low an offer, the letter said. 
"We believe that a higher, more appropriate price for the acquisition of Tandberg, taking into account its growth 
profile and the substantial scope for sales and cost synergies, is not in conflict with Cisco's respect of the 
principles of prudence and financial fairness," the letter said. 
The "principles of prudence and fairness" refers to a Nov. 2 blog post by Ned Hooper,Cisco's chief strategy 
officer, who argued that while Cisco stands to benefit from buying Tandberg, there are risks involved for Cisco. 
Given those risks, $3 billion is a fair price for Tandberg, Hooper said, adding that Cisco has a history of strong 
financial returns from the companies it buys, and that "Cisco will always act with fiscal prudence." 
Cisco has set a Nov. 9 deadline on the offer, and has said it needs 90 percent of shareholders to approve the 
deal before it moves forward. Analysts have predicted that eventually Cisco will increase its offer, though there 
also has been speculation that the company will walk away from the deal, which already has the backing of 
Tandberg's board of directors. 
Investors that hold about 30 percent of Tandberg's stock already have said they will not vote for the deal, 
preferring instead to seek a higher bid from Cisco or another company or to keep Tandberg independent. 
During a conference call to announce Cisco's quarterly earnings Nov. 4, CEO John Chambers expressed 
confidence that the deal will be done, but also said Cisco didn't have to have Tandberg to make its video 
conferencing push. 
What Cisco really stands to gain by acquiring Tandberg is an expanded customer base and products that already 
are established in the small and midsize business space. Cisco's TelePresence technology has strong adoption 
rates in enterprises.

SCENARIOS-Cisco 's options, as Tandberg bid faces opposition 
SCENARIOS-Cisco's options, as Tandberg bid faces opposition

NEW YORK/LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - U.S. network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc faces a touch choice 
as the Monday deadline approaches for its $3 billion tender offer for Norwegian video conferencing company 
Tandberg ASA . 
Investors holding about 30 percent of Tandberg's shares have demanded a higher price than the 153.50 crowns 
($26.93) per share that Cisco offered, which presumably means that the U.S. company will not get the 90 percent 
shareholder approval that it would need to close the acquisition. 
Click on [ID:nL3595357] for a Reuters poll of 14 analysts, of whom 12 believed the current offer would not win 90 
percent approval. 
Here are some possible scenarios for Cisco: 
EXTEND OFFER AT CURRENT PRICE 
The one-month tender offer expires Nov. 9 at 1730 CET (1630 GMT). Cisco could extend the deadline and 
continue to negotiate with shareholders for a maximum of 10 weeks, or until mid-December. 
If Cisco extended without changing the terms, and Tandberg shares and the overall market fell, some investors 
might reconsider their resistance, analysts say. However, Most expect an extended offer would lead to a higher 
bid. 
RAISE BID 
Many analysts expect Cisco to raise its offer, or sweeten the bid in some way, because the company has said 
that online video communications will be a key growth area. 
Peter Germonpre of Panta Capital, a small London firm advising on merger arbitrage, told Reuters a fair value 
would be at least 170 Norwegian crowns. [ID:nL6717543] Tandberg shares closed flat at 151.00 Norwegian 
crowns on Friday. 
"We believe Cisco will go the extra mile to complete the deal due to Tandberg's vital role in Cisco's collaboration 
strategy," said Danske Markets Equities analyst Martin Stenshall. 
He sees "a greater probability, a 75 percent likelihood, that Cisco will increase its bid, rather than walk away from 
the deal, a 25 percent likelihood." 
WALK AWAY 
Some analysts, however, said that raising the bid could set a bad precedent for Cisco, particularly as it has said it 
expects to buy more companies to further diversify its business from the routers and switches that direct Web 
traffic. 
Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said earlier this week that he believes the Tandberg deal will be closed, 
but he also threatened to drop the offer. 
"We've already walked away from a couple of deals this year where we could not get the right pricing," he said. 
He told Reuters: "There's no acquisition that is a must-have."

Page 54 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Some analysts think that this is just rhetoric from Chambers and that Cisco is unlikely to abandon its quest for 
Tandberg after touting the benefits of the merger so aggressively. 
If Cisco really walked away, Tandberg shares would be expected to fall. The stock had closed at 138.30 crowns 
a day before Cisco's bid was announced. At that point, Tandberg had already risen around 45 percent since the 
start of the year on speculation that it was an acquisition target. 
ACCEPT SMALLER STAKE 
Cisco could waive some conditions of the deal, particularly the requirement that 90 percent of Tandberg 
shareholders must tender their shares, accept a smaller stake in the company and increase its holding over time. 
The question is whether a 70 percent stake -- assuming all the opposing investors refused the tender -- would be 
enough for Cisco to feel confident that it could manage the company effectively. 
Also, some Tandberg shareholders who accept Cisco's tender offer could add a clause seeking additional 
compensation if Cisco offered a higher price a few months later to buy the remaining shares. It is unclear whether 
Cisco would accept such demands. 
RIVAL BID 
Most analysts see a rival bid for Tandberg as unlikely, given the size of the deal. 
But they have said Cisco's offer, regardless of when and how it closed, could trigger more deals involving video 
conferencing firms like No. 2 player Polycom Inc . 
Other technology companies like Hewlett-Packard Co also offer high-end video conferencing. ($1=5.701

Cisco 's Tandberg Bid Under Threat From Unhappy Owners 
Cisco's Tandberg Bid Under Threat From Unhappy Owners

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Minority owners in Tandberg ASA (TAA.OS) Friday said Cisco Systems Inc's 
(CSCO) recommended bid for the Norwegian video-conferencing-equipment maker is at least 11% too low and 
should be raised if it is to be accepted. 
In an open letter ahead of the offer period expiration on Nov. 9, investment firm Panta Capital and advisory firm 
Scott & Associates AG said Cisco's current 153.50 Norwegian kroner per share offer doesn't adequately reflect 
Tandberg's operational performance or the valuation of its peers. 
An acceptable bid price would be at least NOK170 a share, Panta Capital's managing director Peter Germonpre 
told Dow Jones Newswires. 
However, Cisco press spokesman Tim Burt told Dow Jones Newswires Friday that his company considers the 
current bid premium to be "full and fair." 
He said Cisco hasn't yet decided whether it will extend the offer period and walking away from the Tandberg bid 
could be an option. 
Cisco will disclose its decision after reviewing the level of acceptance on Nov. 9, said Burt. He said the 90% 
acceptance aimed for by Cisco is "a demanding threshold" and the company doesn't yet know how many 
Tandberg owners may accept the current bid. 
Cisco and Tandberg on Oct. 1 announced the recommended bid offer, which values the Norwegian company at 
around 17.2 billion Norwegian kroner ($3.03 billion). The offer represents an 11% premium to Tandberg's share 
price Sept. 30, and a 38% premium to the price on July 15 before reports emerged about an coming bid. 
Peter Germonpre said Friday Panta Capital and Scott & Associates each represent less than 1% of the total 
shares in Tandberg, but that he has spoken to other Tandberg shareholders who "have the same issues and 
concerns" about the bid. 
"I think the acceptance is going to be pretty low," he said. 
Swedish brokerage SEB Enskilda Oct. 15 said owners of 24% of Tandberg's shares, which it represented, had 
rejected Cisco's bid claiming that the premium was too low. 
Panta Capital and Scott & Associates aren't among the owners represented by SEB Enskilda, Germonpre said 
Friday. 
Tandberg press spokesman Geir Olsen declined to comment regarding the ongoing bid process. 
Cisco has pushed into 30 new business areas, including video-conferencing systems, which it says could each 
produce $1 billion a year in revenue. The move into "telepresence" reinforces the Silicon Valley-based 
networking-equipment company's rivalry with Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), which also sells video-conferencing 
gear and has stepped up its investment in networking equipment. 
Cisco this week posted a 19% profit drop and a 13% revenue decline for its fiscal first quarter, but Chief Executive 
John Chambers issued his most forceful comments yet that the economy was improving and that businesses 
were ready to resume spending on technology.

Page 56 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
In recent weeks, Cisco has backed up its optimistic view by spending more than $6 billion on four acquisitions, 
including its offer for Tandberg. 
At 1207 GMT, shares in Tandberg traded up 0.6% at NOK152, against a 0.5% rise in the wider Olso market.

By Quentin Webb 
LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Advisers to a small band of shareholders in Norwegian video conferencing company 
Tandberg ASA added their voices to calls for suitor Cisco Systems Inc to up its $3 billion bid, ahead of a Monday 
offer deadline. 
Cisco has made its offer for Tandberg -- its first attempt at a European public takeover -- conditional on 90 
percent acceptance. 
However, the network equipment maker has run into resistance from roughly 30 percent of Tandberg 
shareholders. Some previous Scandinavian takeover tussles, such as the purchase of Gambro in 2006, have 
resulted in higher offers being made. 
Tandberg shares were little changed at 152.20 Norwegian crowns ($26.70), up 0.79 percent but below the 
153.50 crowns offer price. The stock traded as high as 159.20 crowns in October, on hopes of a higher offer. 
In an open letter published on the website of Panta Capital, a small London firm advising on merger arbitrage, it 
and Zurich-based Scott & Associates AG said the offer did not represent a real premium to market value, as 
measured by peer valuation, historical trading, or operational performance. 
A higher price "taking into account its growth profile and the substantial scope for sales and cost synergies, is not 
in conflict with Cisco's respect of the principles of prudence and financial fairness," the firms wrote, responding to 
an earlier blog post by a Cisco official. 
In a telephone interview, Peter Germonpre of Panta Capital told Reuters a fair value would be at least 170 
Norwegian crowns. He said the two firms represented European individual investors holding less than 1 percent 
of Tandberg stock. 
A Nov. 3 Reuters poll of 14 analysts found 12 believed the current offer would not win 90 percent approval. 
[ID:nL3595357] Should that happen, Cisco is faced with a choice of extending the deadline for its existing offer, 
raising its bid, walking away, or accepting a lower stake in a still-listed Tandberg. 
Earlier this week investment adviser OppenheimerFunds said it would not agree to sell the 5.78 percent stake it 
held on behalf of others, while brokerage SEB Enskilda says investors holding another 24 percent are opposed. 
[ID:nN0435354] 
On Wednesday Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said he believed Cisco would close the transaction but 
no acquisition was a "must have". [ID:nN04515993] ($1=5.701 Norwegian Crown) (Editing by Simon Jessop)

By Ritsuko Ando 
NEW YORK, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc's $3 billion takeover bid for Norwegian company Tandberg 
ASA is facing increased opposition, with investors owning as much as 30 percent of the video conferencing 
company's shares now demanding more money. 
Investment adviser OppenheimerFunds, on behalf of funds and accounts owning a 5.78 percent stake in 
Tandberg, said on Wednesday that it will not agree to sell their 6.48 million shares to Cisco at the current offer 
price of 153.50 crowns per share. 
OppenheimerFunds said it remains open to better offers from Cisco or other strategic partners. 
Another investor group, represented by brokerage SEB Enskilda and holding 24 percent of Tandberg shares, 
snubbed Cisco's bid last month. 
OppenheimerFunds spokesman Bruce Dunbar said it was not part of the earlier group. 
The deal has been endorsed by Tandberg's board of directors but it needs to be approved by 90 percent of 
shareholders. 
Cisco on Wednesday reiterated its view that the company is offering a fair price for Tandberg. 
"Further, Cisco's general approach to M&A activities is that no acquisition should be pursued or completed if it 
runs counter to the broader principles of prudence and financial fairness," it said in a statement. 
A person familiar with the matter had told Reuters last week that Cisco is mulling its options including withdrawing 
or raising the bid. Tandberg shareholders have until Nov. 9 to accept the tender offer. [ID:nLU639058] 
Cisco is set to announce its quarterly results on Wednesday, and analysts are listening for Chief Executive John 
Chambers' comments on the Tandberg deal. 
Some analysts have said they expect Cisco to sweeten the offer, while others have said it could play hardball and 
threaten to drop its bid -- which will likely lead to a drop in Tandberg shares since no other suitor has emerged 
publicly. 
Shares of Cisco closed up 1.7 percent at $23.30. Tandberg shares closed down 0.13 percent at 150.20 euros.

By Ritsuko Ando 
NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc said on Monday it has agreed to buy the set-top box business 
of Hong Kong-based DVN (Holdings) Ltd for as much as $44.5 million, as the world's top network equipment 
maker continues its acquisition spree. 
The move, Cisco's first acquisition aimed at the Chinese market, also shows the company stepping up investment 
in a fast-growing market where it faces competition from rivals like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. DVN 
sells digital broadcasting equipment and services in China. 
Cisco said that China has the most cable subscribers in the world. About one third of 160 million to 170 millions 
are using digital cable, and the government has mandated that all users shift to digital set-top boxes by 2015, it 
said. 
"That presents for Cisco and other competitors in the market a very, very compelling market opportunity," said 
Hilton Romanski, vice president of corporate development for Cisco. 
Romanski said that Cisco has invested more in China than any other market outside the United States, and the 
latest deal will further bolster its ability to compete locally. 
"What we're trying to get access to is good local expertise that can help us think about how to make this 
transition, becoming an increasingly local company in China," he said. 
Cisco said it will pay $17.5 million upfront, and will pay an additional amount of up to $27 million over four years. 
The final amount depends on sales, although Cisco declined to specify any targets. 
Cisco said it also plans to enter into an alliance with DVN to utilize its software, applications and support services. 
The acquired set-top box business will become part of Cisco's international cable business unit, while the DVN 
business will continue to run from China. 
The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2010. Cisco said the initial payment will come from its foreign cash 
earned from overseas sales. 
Cisco is also planning to use foreign cash to fund its planned $3 billion acquisition of Norwegian 
videoconferencing giant Tandberg ASA , although some Tandberg shareholders have recently balked at the offer 
price. 
Cisco has been one of the most aggressive companies on the technology M&A front. Both its bid for Tandberg 
and its plan to buy wireless equipment maker Starent Networks for $2.9 billion were announced in October, and 
Chief Executive John Chambers has said there was more to come.

Romanski said Cisco will spend more in China. 
"We're going to continue to invest both equity as well as venture capital funding into the Chinese market ... and 
we'll continue to look for interesting acquisition opportunities as well," he said. 
Shares of San Jose, California-based Cisco rose 19 cents to close at $23 on the Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by

Cisco, the computer networking giant, has spent the last decade acquiring rivals and buying back stock. It's time 
to acknowledge that this strategy isn't working. Investors who bought Cisco's shares a decade ago have received 
no return on their investment. 
Results this week should give Cisco another chance to profess its optimism. Technology markets are rebounding. 
And John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, will talk about the 26 new product areas that he thinks can each 
generate $1 billion in sales in the near term. 
Eternal ebullience is nothing new from Mr. Chambers, who once claimed Cisco could increase sales by 50 
percent a year over the long run. They've since grown 7 percent annually. 
Yet the years of deal making may be making Cisco unwieldy. Cisco has 59 standing boards and councils. This 
seems like a recipe for endless meetings, management confusion and reduced accountability. 
The company says it's a way to involve more people in decision-making. In any case, Cisco continues to acquire 
new businesses -- $22 billion worth since 2002 (including some $7 billion this year), according to Dealogic. 
Cisco has always acquired and plugged companies into its sales and production network. These firms either 
strengthened Cisco's core business, selling routing and switching systems, or helped increase demand for its 
products. 
There was another positive side effect of this: optimistic investors valued Cisco on earnings several years in the 
future. So Cisco could buy small companies at lower valuations with its supercharged stock and reap the benefit 
as investors then rerated the acquired earnings at Cisco's higher multiple. 
As the trajectories of the shares of other former acquisition machines like Tyco International and General Electric 
show, this strategy can stumble when companies reach a certain size. The purchaser needs more or bigger deals 
to show impressive growth. Cisco is indeed chasing larger ones; it recently agreed to buy Starent Networks and 
Tandberg for about $3 billion each. 
Still, Cisco may walk away from Tandberg because minority investors want more money. That suggests the 
company is keeping some fiscal discipline. But if Cisco follows the acquisition machine model, the difficulty in 
running the company smoothly while mounting ever-larger deals will become increasingly evident. 
Investors may become cautious, and reduce the value they attach to the acquisition machine's stock. When that 
happens, deals done using stock become unattractive and investors often begin clamoring for a breakup, rather 
than more acquisitions. 
The other pillar of Cisco's strategy, stock repurchases, hasn't rewarded shareholders either. Returning excess 
cash from operations to shareholders should increase a stock price. Unfortunately, in Cisco's case, the practice 
hasn't measured up to theory. Cisco has spent close to $60 billion on stock buybacks since the start of its 2002 
fiscal year. That's about three-quarters of cash flow from operations. So why haven't shareholders benefited? 
First, the total count of shares outstanding has only decreased by 1.3 billion. This is partly because of dilutive 
acquisitions. However, if the number of shares hasn't shrunk much and Cisco's stock hasn't risen, this presents a

Page 63 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
conundrum. What exactly is the benefit to shareholders of these purchases? Shouldn't the price of a slice of Cisco 
increase if it is spending so much on buybacks? 
One might argue that's because Cisco's stock is undervalued. A less appealing alternative is that Cisco is in the 
habit of overpaying to win control of companies it covets. In this case, the benefits accrue to the seller. 
Part of the blame, however, lies in Cisco's generous use of options as compensation. Mr. Chambers was one of 
the loudest voices in Silicon Valley against forcing companies to show the cost of these grants. When Cisco 
spends cash to mop up the resulting shares, management gets the benefit over shareholders. 
After 10 years of searching for the promised land of growth, it's time for something different. Slowing acquisitions 
would a good start. If the strategy's benefit isn't apparent after a decade of purchases, it is hard to see how it will 
appear magically now. 
Moreover, if Cisco is so complex that it requires 59 councils, it should consider breaking into more manageable 
pieces. Lastly, since buybacks haven't rewarded shareholders, the company should switch to a dividend. Mr. 
Chambers has promised shareholders one before he retires. Adding one soon would be a great way to show that 
his baby has matured.

pieces. Lastly, since buybacks haven't rewarded shareholders, the company should switch to a dividend. Mr. 
Chambers has promised shareholders one before he retires. Adding one soon would be a great way to show that 
his baby has matured.

By Ritsuko Ando 
NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc's quarterly results this week are expected to reflect some 
recovery in tech spending, but it may be hard to get investors to commit more money to a stock that is already up 
40 percent this year. 
Analysts will also focus on what's next in the company's aggressive acquisition strategy, and particularly whether 
it intends to raise its $3 billion bid for Tandberg after a group of the videoconferencing company's investors 
demanded a higher price. [ID:nLU639058] 
Mergers and acquisitions have played a key part in Cisco's growth, helping it become the top vendor of routers, 
switches and other network equipment to businesses and phone companies. 
Analysts said Wednesday's results are likely to show more customers beginning to invest in their networks after 
putting off large investment decisions during the recession, but they also said much of that has already been 
priced into the stock. 
Citigroup analyst Richard Gardner expects the results to show improving demand, but added: "That said, given 
ramping expectations and Cisco's penchant for conservatism...fiscal first quarter results and guidance are unlikely 
to be a significant near-term catalyst." 
Analysts on average expect fiscal first-quarter revenue of $8.74 billion, down 15 percent from a year earlier but up 
2 percent from the previous quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. They see second-quarter revenue at 
$8.96 billion. 
Earnings are expected to be 31 cents a share excluding options expenses. A year ago, Cisco reported earnings 
excluding items of 42 cents. 
While the U.S. economy grew at a faster-than-expected 3.5 percent in the third quarter, other recent economic 
indicators including housing and unemployment remain weak. 
BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long was wary of expecting the results to trigger a significant rise in the 
shares. 
"We believe Cisco would need to report revenue upside of about $200 million with at least 1 cent of EPS upside in 
the fiscal Q1 and Q2 in order not to disappoint investors," he said. Long has a $21 price target and "market 
perform" rating on the shares. 
DEALMAKING NOT OVER

While Cisco's outlook for the current quarter is likely to be the main focus, analysts will also pay attention to any 
comments on Tandberg. 
An acquisition of the Norwegian market leader in videoconferencing would help Cisco accelerate its push into 
video communications, complementing its high-end TelePresence video meeting service for executives. 
"Ultimately, we believe Cisco's down market move in the enterprise video space makes too much sense for it to 
potentially lose over several hundred million dollars, and we expect Cisco to come to an agreement that is likely 
to include raising its offer," Long said. 
UBS analyst Nikos Theodosopoulos, however, said he does not expect Cisco to offer more. "We doubt Cisco will 
raise its bid as it would set a bad precedent for the company," he said, adding that Cisco may announce more 
deals before the year-end. 
Chief Executive John Chambers has said Cisco will remain an active buyer as it positions itself for an economic 
recovery and the next wave of network spending. Two weeks after announcing the Tandberg bid, Cisco unveiled 
a $2.9 billion deal for wireless equipment maker Starent Networks . 
Analysts say Cisco, which generated $2 billion in cash flow from operations last quarter, can do more deals but 
may opt for some financial engineering to bolster its war chest. 
Methods include issuing debt or reducing its pace of share buybacks. It may also repatriate some of its foreign 
cash if it wants to buy more U.S. companies, BMO's Long said, although that could have costly tax implications. 
Wedbush Morgan Securities, in a research note last week, said there was a wide range of companies that could 
be Cisco's next acquisition target, including business software makers like VMware Inc and BMC Software Inc .

ScanSafe Purchase Extends 
A Series of Acquisitions 
Cisco Systems Inc. agreed Tuesday to acquire security-software maker ScanSafe Inc. for $183 million, continuing 
the networking giant's recent acquisition binge. 
The deal is Cisco's third this month, following a $3 billion acquisition of video-conferencing specialist Tandberg 
ASA and a $2.9 billion purchase of wireless-equipment maker Starent Networks Corp. 
ScanSafe, which has offices in San Francisco and London, makes software that scans Web sites for malicious 
code. Chief Executive John Chambers said Cisco plans to expand into areas outside its core business of selling 
networking gear such as routers and switches.

PEPSICO 
European Commission 
Clears Purchase of Bottlers 
The European Commission Tuesday cleared U.S.-based PepsiCo Inc. to buy bottling companies PepsiAmericas 
Inc. and Pepsi Bottling Group Inc. 
PepsiAmericas mostly bottles PepsiCo beverages with operations in the U.S., Central and Eastern Europe, the 
Caribbean and Central America, the commission said. Pepsi Bottling bottles mainly PepsiCo drinks with 
operations in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Spain, Russia, Greece and Turkey. 
PepsiCo agreed in August to pay $7.8 billion for the shares it didn't already own of Pepsi Bottling and 
PepsiAmericas. 
The deal, which is still awaiting regulatory approval in the U.S., is expected to close early next year.

The state judge, following a similar decision early this year by a Minneapolis federal judge, concluded the lawsuits 
were "preempted" by the fact that the Food and Drug Administration regulates medical devices. The preemption 
doctrine comes from a U.S. Supreme Court decision ruling out liability cases when medical devices are federally 
regulated. Medtronic withdrew the Sprint Fidelis wires in October 2007 after concluding fractures had been linked 
to patients' deaths.

revenue-recognition practices. 
Apollo, whose University of Phoenix is the country's largest private college, reported fiscal fourth-quarter results 
Tuesday that beat Wall Street estimates. But news of the probe, its second this year, sent its shares tumbling in 
late trading. 
Finance Chief Brian Swartz said in a conference call Tuesday that the company believes "that our revenue 
recognition policies are appropriate and in accordance with GAAP."

CLEAR CHANNEL 
President Steps Down 
Randall Mays, president and chief financial officer of CC Media Holdings Inc.'s Clear Channel Communications, is 
stepping down, according to an announcement sent to company employees late Tuesday. 
Since theSan Antonio, Texas-based radio and billboard giant was taken private last year, many key strategic 
decisions have been made by the private-equity companies that spearheaded the privatization: Bain Capital LLC 
and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP. 
A company spokeswoman said Mr. Mays wasn't available for comment. He is to stay on as vice chairman until 
2013, when his contract expires. His elder brother, Mark Mays, will remain chief executive, and add the title of 
president.

BOSTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems is buying privately held Web security company ScanSafe for about 
$183 million, a move that will intensify its battle with security giants Symantec Corp and McAfee Inc . 
ScanSafe sells Web-based services that protect business computer networks and PCs from hackers, saving 
companies the cost of buying and installing software on their own equipment. 
The top two security software companies, Symantec and McAfee, already sell such products, which are known as 
"cloud" services and whose sales are growing at a far faster clip than traditional software. 
Cisco announced the deal on Tuesday, saying it expects the transaction to close in its fiscal second quarter that 
ends in January 2010. 
The $183 million price tag includes cash and retention-based incentives, Cisco said. 
The deal helps Cisco expand its security portfolio, which includes email and Web security software company 
IronPort that it bought in 2007. 
San Jose, California-based Cisco has in recent months stepped up its pace of acquisitions. It announced deals 
for wireless equipment maker Starent Networks Corp for $2.9 billion and Norwegian video conferencing maker 
Tandberg for $3 billion. Chief Executive John Chambers has said he was looking to do more. 
Cisco shares fell 15 cents, or 0.6 percent to $23.55 in afternoon Nasdaq trade. That was narrower than the 1 
percent drop in the Nasdaq Composite Index. (Reporting by Sinead Carew, Ritsuko Ando and Jim Finkle; Editing

Cisco to Buy Starent for $2.9 Billion

Cisco to Buy Starent for $2.9 Billion

Cisco Systems Inc. said it agreed to acquire Starent Networks Corp. for $2.9 billion, making good on a pledge by 
its chief executive to expand aggressively as the tech industry comes out of recession. 
Cisco said Tuesday it will pay $35 a share for Starent, a Tewksbury, Mass., maker of software and equipment for 
wireless-communications carriers. That represents a 21% premium to Starent's closing stock price of $29.03 
Monday on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
CEO John Chambers has said repeatedly to expect Cisco to make more acquisitions as the economy recovers, 
including deals that move it into businesses where it hasn't been a major player. 
"You'll see us be the most aggressive this year and next year that we've ever been in the history of our company," 
he said in a recent interview. Mr. Chambers added that Cisco's preference was to acquire smaller companies and 
team up with larger ones. 
Cisco's acquisition of Starent fits Mr. Chambers's strategy of forging into markets that promise the most growth in 
the wake of the recession. The volume of data that travels on wireless networks is expected to double each year 
until 2013, according to Cisco, as people increasingly access the Internet on mobile devices. 
To accommodate that traffic, carriers will have to buy and install new equipment of the kind Starent sells. 
The acquisition should increase Cisco's ability to help carriers manage the data moving across wireless networks, 
said Ned Hooper, chief of Cisco's strategy office. 
"The single biggest growth opportunity for networking companies is to be involved with wireless upgrades," said 
Zeus Kerravala, an analyst at research company Yankee Group. 
Historically, telecom carriers have accounted for about 30% of Cisco's revenue, which totaled $36.1 billion for its 
fiscal year ended in July. But Cisco was losing business to rivals such as Alcatel-Lucent of France and Huawei 
Technologies Co. of China because it couldn't offer wireless equipment to go along with its traditional networking 
gear, Mr. Kerravala said. "This is a piece of business that will be very important to them over the long term," he 
said of the Starent deal. 
In 4 p.m. trading on Nasdaq Tuesday, Starent's shares were up $4.88, or 17%, at $33.91, while Cisco's shares 
were up 11 cents at $23.89. 
The deal follows a wave of consolidation in the technology industry as tech companies seek to position 
themselves for a recovery. Cisco said earlier this month it would buy Tandberg ASA of Norway for about $3 
billion. In the past month, Dell Inc. spent $3.9 billion to buy Perot Systems Inc.; Xerox Corp. shelled out $5.6 
billion for Affiliated Computer Services Inc.; and Adobe Systems Inc. paid $1.8 billion for Omniture Inc. 
As some of these larger companies snap up smaller ones in a bid to extend their product lines, their offerings are 
increasingly overlapping. 
The Starent deal adds to the evidence that the climate for tech deals is likely to heat up. As the economy 
improves, "both buyers and sellers are feeling that it is comfortable to get together," Cisco's Mr. Hooper said in an 
interview.

Page 72 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Networking-equipment maker Brocade Communications Systems Inc. has shopped itself, with Hewlett-Packard 
Co. among its suitors, and analysts say that other potential buyout targets include F5 Networks Inc., Riverbed 
Technologies Inc. and Tekelec. 
Meanwhile, industry titans such as International Business Machines Corp., H-P, Oracle Corp., Cisco and Dell are 
sitting on cash hoardsmore than $10 billion each as of their most recent quarters. 
Cisco's deal for Starent could have the most immediate impact on Juniper Networks Inc., Cisco's keenest rival in 
selling gear to telecom carriers, said Nikos Theodosopoulos, an analyst at UBS Securities. 
Mr. Theodosopoulos said Juniper had been discussing a partnership with Starent, and now probably will have to 
invest more to develop its own wireless equipment or make an acquisition to help it in that business. 
"Juniper has a strong presence, portfolio and partnerships in the mobile-networking market," said company 
spokeswoman Melanie Branon. She added that Starent is one of many potential partners that Juniper has 
evaluated. 
Cisco started the current quarter with $35 billion in cash, though $29 billion of that reserve was overseas and 
subject to taxes if used in the U.S. 
Mr. Hooper said that only cash from the U.S. was used in the Starent deal. 
Starent Networks, which was founded in 2000 and went public in 2007, reported 2008 revenue of $254.1 million, 
up 74% from the previous year. It continued to grow during the recession, with revenue of $78.3 million in the 
June quarter, up 28% from a year earlier. 
Cisco's deal to acquire the company includes a 3% breakup fee in case another bidder makes a higher offer for 
Starent. Cisco expects the transaction to close during the first half of 2010.

TECH VIEW: Cisco , The Acquisitive Giant, Returns To Play 
TECH VIEW: Cisco, The Acquisitive Giant, Returns To Play 
By Therese Poletti 
A DOW JONES COLUMN

15 October 2009

Dow Jones News Service 
DJ 
English 
(c) 2009 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
Not since Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) did a big debt offering earlier this year has there been so much rampant 
speculation about what the networking giant will buy next. 
Earlier this week, Cisco made its second multibillion-dollar buy in 14 days. With that, many believe it is safe to say 
Cisco is back on the prowl for deals as it continues to look for growth and enter new markets. 
It's a good sign for the recovery of the tech business. You can also bet that Silicon Valley's bankers and venture 
capitalists are trying to line up appointments with Ned Hooper, Chief Executive John Chambers' deal point man. 
So as speculation runs rampant in the Valley, it's fun to try and guess what might be of interest to the world's 
largest networking company. 
Cisco has not done many uber mergers. Its biggest deals to date remain its purchase of the privately held optical 
company Cerent Corp. at the height of the dot-com boom for nearly $7 billion in August 1999 and Scientific 
Atlanta, the cable box company, for about $6.9 billion in 2005. It has also bought many startups and done lots of 
"sub-one billion dollar" deals for miscellaneous software and hardware companies along the way. 
But with its new growing rivalry with Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), it might consider some bigger deals than it has 
done in the past. 
One of the most off-the-wall ideas this week is that Cisco might step into the services business, just as 
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) did over a decade ago, and where H-P, Dell Inc. (DELL) and Xerox 
Corp. (XRX) are all going now. Dell and Xerox both made sizeable acquisitions in the last few weeks to get there. 
With Dell's deal to buy Perot Systems Corp. (PER) in place, and Xerox planning to buy Affiliated Computer 
Services Inc. (ACS), there are not many candidates left. 
"There is one company," said Rajan Varadarajan, a vice president at Primary Global Research LLC, in Palo Alto, 
and a former Cisco executive. "Accenture PLC (ACN). Accenture is pretty big but they are partners already." 
Big indeed. Accenture has a nearly $25 billion market cap and fiscal 2009 revenue of $21.58 billion, down from 
$23.38 billion in fiscal 2008. 
"That would be a very highly speculative thing for me to say, but that's one thing that makes perfect sense," said 
Varadarajan. 
On the face of it, this idea seems absurd based on Cisco's past deal experience. But as the grudge match 
develops between Cisco and H-P, now moving into each other's territories, it's not completely inconceivable. 
Cisco is cited as a strategic partner with EDS and visa versa on the respective Web sites for Cisco and H-P. But 
with EDS now under the H-P umbrella, Cisco might fear EDS isn't as eager to sell Cisco networking gear, since 
H-P now is making a big push of its own ProCurve line of networking products. 
"When H-P bought EDS, that was a huge blow to Cisco," Varadarajan said. 
Cisco had cash and securities valued at $35 billion at the end of July. But the bulk is offshore. Cisco is using 
some of its roughly $29 billion in offshore cash to buy Tandberg ASA (TAA.OS), the video conferencing system

Page 74 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
company in Norway. But to use any of its offshore cash, it could take a tax hit anywhere from 25% to 35% to bring 
it back to the U.S. 
Aggressive Acquisitions 
Ideas for what Cisco might buy come from its continued focus to gain an even bigger footprint in the corporate 
data center and on other ways to get more traffic around the network. Which is one reason Cisco loves video, 
because it sends big fat data packets across networks, fueling the need for more switches and routers, its core 
business. 
This week's deal to buy Starent Networks Corp. (STAR) is aimed at building a presence in the next generation 
cellular network infrastructure. 
Other candidates that have been speculated on in the past include Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS), which now owns 
some virtualization software, among its other software products and competes with VMware Inc. (VMW). 
VWware, and EMC Corp. (EMC), which owns a big stake in VMware, have both been tossed about as ideas, 
especially since Cisco owns a small stake in VMware. It could also use storage to fill out its offerings in the data 
center. NetApp Inc. (NTAP) also comes up in theorizing on whether Cisco needs more storage. Most analysts say 
Brocade Communications Systems Inc. (BRCD) would raise too many antitrust concerns, and have ruled that 
possibility out. 
EMC would constitute a serious mega-deal. The storage and software giant has an even larger market cap than 
Accenture, currently at about $36 billion. 
"We will continue to be aggressive driving acquisitions," said Hooper, whose official title is senior vice president of 
corporate development and consumer group, in an analysts' call this week. "And I would just say that acquisitions 
by their nature have a tendency to be a bit lumpy about when things come together and when they don't." Hooper 
also pointed out Cisco's "great financial flexibility and ability to tap into lines of credit and the debt markets." 
Until then, Wall Street and Silicon Valley will have to play a guessing game, which can also be a fool's game.

Cisco Systems Inc. on Tuesday said it agreed to acquire Starent Networks Corp. for $2.9 billion, the latest deal in 
the rapidly consolidating technology industry. 
Cisco will pay $35 a share for Starent, a Tewksbury, Mass., maker of software and gear for wireless carriers. That 
represents a 21% premium over Starent's closing stock price of $29.03 Monday on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Cisco expects the transaction to close during the first half of 2010. 
The acquisition is likely to increase Cisco's ability to help carriers manage the data moving across their wireless 
networks, said Ned Hooper, chief of Cisco's strategy office. The amount of data that travels on these networks is 
set to double each year until 2013 as people increasingly access the Internet via mobile devices, according to

In order to accommodate the increased traffic, carriers have to buy and deploy new equipment such as the kind

added. 
Historically, about 30% of Cisco's revenue comes from carriers, the company said. Cisco reported $36.1 billion in

Systems Inc., Xerox Corp. shelled out $5.6 billion for Affiliated Computer Services Inc., and Adobe Systems Inc. 
paid $1.8 billion for Omniture Inc. 
During the depths of the recession, tech companies said that they didn't have much insight into 
customer-spending patterns. This made it difficult to get deals made, said Jeff Evenson, an analyst at Sanford C. 
Bernstein and Co. 
Now that the economy seems to have stabilized "companies have a reasonable idea of what will happen in the 
next year or so," Mr. Evenson said. "They hear customers starting to spend more." 
That has made acquisitions more attractive. As the economy improves "both buyers and sellers are feeling that it 
is comfortable to get together," Cisco's Mr. Hooper said in an interview. 
Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers has saidrepeatedly that his company would be aggressive during the 
economic downturn. Cisco started the current quarter with $35 billion in cash, although $29 billion of that reserve 
was overseas and subject to taxes if used in the U.S. Mr. Hooper, the Cisco strategy chief, said that only cash 
from the U.S. was used in the deal.

Cisco Systems agreed on Tuesday to buy Starent Networks for $35 a share in cash, or about $2.9bn in cash, in 
the US network group's second big move in as many weeks following its $3bn cash offer for Norway's Tandberg. 
Both deals reaffirm Cisco's willingness to boost its presence in delivering video content over cellular and internet 
networks. The boards of both companies approved the deal, which will go before shareholders and regulators 
before an expected closing in the first half of 2010. 
Starent shares closed Monday up 17 cents at $29.03, after touching a 52-week high of $30. The company has 
been growing rapidly since its founding in 2000, reporting net income of $60.5m on 2008 revenue that climbed 74 
per cent to $255m. The company has 1,000 employees and is based in Tewksbury, Massachusetts. It sold stock 
to the public in 2007. 
"We believe their products and engineering talent will greatly benefit our service provider customers as they build 
out their mobile internet offerings," said Cisco chief executive John Chambers.

Cisco To Acquire Starent For $2.9 Billion

Cisco continued on its aggressive acquisition campaign Tuesday by committing to buy wireless platform enabler 
Starent Networks for $2.9 billion. 
Starent has been at the cutting edge of providing multimedia core platforms for mobile carriers as they shift from 
2.5G and 3G network technologies to 4G networks. 
The two firms said the deal was "definitive" and that, upon completion of the deal, Starent's chief executive officer, 
Ashraf Dahod will become head of a new Cisco Mobile Internet Technology Group within Cisco's Service Provider 
Business. 
"Combining Cisco's strength in Video and IP with Starent Networks' leading mobile infrastructure solutions," said 
Dahod in a statement, "creates a compelling portfolio of products that provides an integrated architecture to offer 
rich, quality multimedia experiences to mobile subscribers on 3G and 4G networks." 
Earlier this month Cisco acquired videoconferencing equipment provider Tandberg for $3 billion. The Starent 
acquisition appears to fit into Cisco CEO John Chambers' grand strategy to broaden the firm's product mix. Just 
weeks ago, Chambers, citing Cisco's $35 billion acquisition war chest, said the firm planned to make a spate of 
acquisitions. 
Citing the Starent acquisition, Chambers said Starent's "products and engineering talent will greatly benefit our 
Service Provider customers as they build out their Mobile Internet offerings." 
The Starent operation, based in a Boston suburb, will function within Cisco's Service Provider Business, which is 
led by Pankaj Patel, senior vice president and general manager. In a statement, Patel said: "Cisco and Starent 
Networks share a common vision and bring complementary technologies designed to accelerate the transition to 
the Mobile Internet, where the network is the platform for Service Providers to launch, deliver and monetize the 
next generation of mobile multimedia applications and services." 
Starent has landed major contracts in several emerging wireless mobile networks ranging from Verizon Wireless' 
planned shift to Long-Term Evolution (LTE) in the U.S. to a Taiwan consortium that is deploying a nationwide 
WiMax network. 
Starent delivers various solutions including multimedia intelligence, core network functions and services to scale 
mobile infrastructures involving CDMA2000, UMTS/HSPA and WiMax networks. Starent had revenue of about 
$254 million in 2008. The firm has about 1,000 employees. 
Dahod, Starent's co-founder, has had a long and successful career of starting companies and building them up 
until they are acquired. He co-founded NetCore Systems in 1996 and the switching product company was 
acquired by Tellabs in 1999. 
The Cisco deal is for $35 a share, which represents a 20% premium over Starent's Monday closing price.

Cisco boss John Chambers is keeping the acquisition machine humming. The US networking giants $2.9bn 
agreement to purchase Starent Networks is the second of this size in October alone. And hes promised more 
deals are coming  after all, theres around $30bn in cash still sitting on the companys balance sheet. Too bad 
this strategy hasnt quite paid off for shareholders over the past decade. 
Ciscos rationale is much the same as it always has been. It argues that by combining, it can sell more stuff than 
Starent could alone. There may be something to this  Starent produces software and equipment to manage data 
traffic for wireless devices. Cisco sells lots of related products to telecom operators, so the sum of the two firms 
may end up being more than the parts. 
Yet this deal is bigger than Ciscos typical $1bn or smaller target. Small companies usually have weak 
relationships with potential customers and few sales staff, so plugging these groups into Cisco 's marketing 
machine maximises revenue. Starents maturity means such revenue synergies will be harder to come by. 
Moreover, Starent and this months Tandberg acquisition are the fifth and sixth biggest acquisitions Cisco has 
ever done according to data provider Dealogic. This smacks of the $139bn company having to perform larger 
acquisitions, which arguably entail more execution risk, to move the needle. 
Cisco doesnt agree. The company says it is merely being opportunistic and taking advantage of depressed 
valuations. Perhaps, but Cisco is paying a hefty 39 times Starents estimated 2010 earnings. 
The record suggests Starents shareholders have gotten the better end of the stick. They are being offered a 21% 
premium to relinquish control. Cisco shareholders, on the other hand, have seen the value of their stock decline 
by roughly a third over the past decade  despite, or perhaps because of, its prolific deal making. It might be time 
for Cisco to slow down the M&A machine and prove it works. 
Cisco has agreed to buy US-based Starent Networks for $2.9bn in cash. The purchase price of $35 per share is a 
21% premium to the October 12 close. Starent makes software and equipment that handles multimedia data 
traffic for wireless devices. 
On October 1, Cisco agreed to buy Tandberg, a Norway-based maker of video communications technology, for 
approximately $3bn. 
As of July 25, Cisco had $35bn in cash on its balance sheet, of which $29bn was overseas.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 13 (Xinhua) -- Cisco Systems Inc. said on Tuesday it has agreed to buy Starent 
Networks Corp., a U.S. wireless networking equipment maker, for a total price of nearly 2. 9 billion U.S. dollars. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Cisco will pay 35 dollars per share in cash in exchange for each share of 
Starent Networks, which is now based in Tewksbury, Massachusetts. 
"We are very pleased that Starent Networks will be joining the Cisco team, and we believe their products and 
engineering talent will greatly benefit our service provider customers as they build out their mobile Internet 
offerings," John Chambers, chief executive officer (CEO) of Cisco, said in a statement. 
"Combining Cisco's strength in video and IP with Starent Networks' leading mobile infrastructure solutions, 
creates a compelling portfolio of products that provides an integrated architecture to offer rich, quality multimedia 
experiences to mobile subscribers on 3G and 4G networks," Starent Networks CEO Ashraf Dahod said. 
Starent Networks, a provider of infrastructure solutions that enable mobile operators to deliver multimedia 
services to subscribers, was founded in 2000 and completed its initial public offering in 2007. 
The company has about 1,000 employees worldwide and its products, supporting a wide range of mobile wireless 
networks, have been deployed by over 100 mobile operators in 45 countries and regions. 
Cisco said the acquisition is expected to close during the first half of 2010 and will be subject to regulatory 
reviews. 
The deal is Cisco's second major purchase in less than two weeks. On Oct. 1, the world's largest networking 
equipment maker announced that it will buy Norwegian videoconferencing company Tandberg ASA for about 3 
billion U.S. dollars in cash.

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Cisco Systems said Tuesday that it has signed a $2.9 billion deal to buy 
Starent Networks, furthering an aggressive shopping spree with its second major purchase in three weeks. 
Shares of Cisco (CSCO, US) rose a fraction to close at $23.89 after the networking-gear maker unveiled the plan 
to acquire Starent, which makes gear that helps mobile carriers connect wireless phone users to the Internet. 
Shares of Starent (STAR, US) soared 16.8% to close at $33.91. The stock had already run up more than 180% 
since the beginning of the year. 
Just three weeks ago, Cisco said it had struck a $3 billion deal to buy Norway's Tandberg, a maker of 
videoconferencing equipment. The back-to-back blockbuster deals underscore Cisco's strong cash position, 
which many analysts believe the company will use to expand its reach, including into other business areas. 
Under the deal, the San Jose, Calif.-based Cisco will pay $35 a share in cash for each share of Starent. The 
networking-gear giant also will assume outstanding equity awards, the company said. 
Cisco said the deal is expected to close in the half of 2010, "subject to customary closing conditions and 
regulatory reviews," the company said. The acquisition is expected to reduce the tech giant's earnings in the fiscal 
years 2010 and 2011, and begin to add to profits starting in fiscal 2012, the company said. 
Founded in 2000, the Tewksbury, Mass.-based Starent has roughly 1,000 employees worldwide. 
Analyst Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said the back-to-back deals are not surprising, citing 
Chief Executive John Chambers' philosophy of investing in downturns to prepare for future growth. 
"Cisco does have a record of buying companies, even fairly large ones," he said in an email interview, and this 
acquisition is "entirely in line" with Chambers' philosophy. "IP technology," Kay said, "is at the heart of integrating 
a plethora of digital devices scattered around the Internet." 
The decision to acquire a mobile-infrastructure provider also fits into Cisco's growing focus on the mobile 
computing arena, Kay said. 
"Cisco is beefing up its ability to address endpoints, in this case phones," he added. "In recent years, Cisco has 
shifted its formerly industrial strategy to embrace a more consumer focus. A lot of the growth has been in 
consumer, and a lot of interest has swung from PCs to phones." 
Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Modoff said in a note that "the deal makes a good strategic fit for Cisco. Starent 
gives Cisco a stronger mobile edge offering and good customer traction at several major carriers." 
Ticonderoga analyst Brian White said Starent "enhances Cisco's pursuit of the mobile Internet," adding in a note, 
"We believe Starent's mobile core network solutions fill a gap in Cisco's product portfolio and enhance the 
company's offering to service providers."

Page 83 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Meanwhile, Wedbush analyst Matthew Robison downgraded Starent to neutral from outperform, saying in a note, 
"Shares now trade close enough to [the] deal price to take profit in our opinion. The timeframe for closure is 
somewhat distant, the potential for regulatory review is somewhat likely and the price seems high enough to imply 
that further bidding is unlikely." 
Robison said Cisco rival Juniper Networks (JNPR, US) could emerge as a competitive bidder, "since Starent 
offers largely the same benefits for Juniper as for Cisco." 
But he speculated that "an incremental auction seems unlikely." 
"We think the deal price is rich enough to be prohibitive," he wrote. "Juniper may prefer to wait and see if there is 
a regulatory challenge or, perhaps more likely, elect to focus on more enterprise-oriented M&A." 
Avian Securities analyst Avi Cohen said the Cisco deal is bad news for Juniper. "We believe this acquisition is 
extremely negative because it significantly impacts Juniper's ability to compete for mobile core infrastructure 
builds," Cohen said in a note. "This puts Cisco into play within the mobile infrastructure sector, which the 
company has not has much success in over the past eighteen months." 
Cisco Systems signs a $2.9 billion deal to buy Starent Networks, its second major purchase in three weeks.

DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
Networking giant Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) agreed to acquire Starent Networks (STAR), a maker of 
infrastructure equipment used by wireless carriers, for about $2.9 billion. 
The technology bellwether - which has been hurt by the pullback in technology spending - will pay $35 for each 
Starent share, a 24% premium to Monday's closing price. The stock has been on an upward climb since 
November, quadrupling in that time. 
Cisco doesn't expect the deal to begin boosting its bottom line for several years, and will cut into profit the next 
two. 
Upon closing, Starent will become the Mobile Internet Technology Group within Cisco's service-provider business. 
The new group will be managed by Starent Chief Executive Ashraf Dahod. 
Pankaj Patel, who oversees Cisco's service-provider business, said the companies 'share a common vision and 
bring complementary technologies designed to accelerate the transition to the mobile Internet.' 
In August, when Cisco, the world's biggest maker of Internet-connectivity equipment, reported a 46% drop in 
fiscal fourth-quarter profit, Chairman and Chief Executive John Chambers said the company saw a number of 
positive signs of an upturn in technology spending. Cisco, deeply tied to the business world, is a technology 
bellwether because its networking products are crucial components of any corporate infrastructure. 
Starent Networks was founded in 2000 and completed went public two years ago. The company has about 1,000 
employees worldwide and 2008 revenue of $254.1 million, up 74% from a year earlier. Earnings and sales have 
continued to grow this year despite the recession's impact on technology spending. 
Starent makes infrastructure equipment used by wireless carriers to offer enhanced voice and data services such 
as video, multimedia messaging and Internet service. Its products and services also provide management of 
subscriber sessions moving between networks and application of billing and other session policies. 
The Starent deal comes less than two weeks after Cisco agreed to a $3 billion acquisition of Norway's Tandberg 
ASA (TAA.OS), expanding the Silicon Valley company's push into video-conferencing and escalating a growing 
rivalry with Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ). -By Mike Barris, Dow Jones Newswires; 212-416-2330;

Cisco announced Tuesday it has agreed to buy wireless equipment maker Starent Networks for 2.9 billion dollars, 
the latest in a string of acquisitions by the US networking giant. 
The San Jose, California-based Cisco said it will pay 35 dollars in cash for each share of the Tewksbury, 
Massachusetts-based company, a premium of around 20 percent over Starent's closing price on Monday. 
Cisco said the deal, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, was expected to 
close in the first half of 2010 and is subject to regulatory approval. 
Starent makes networking equipment that allows mobile operators to transmit large amounts of data to 
smartphones and other connected devices. 
According to Cisco, global mobile data traffic is expected to more than double every year through 2013. 
"We believe their products and engineering talent will greatly benefit our service provider customers as they build 
out their mobile Internet offerings," said Cisco chairman and chief executive John Chambers. 
Starent president and chief executive Ashraf Dahod said the combined companies will offer "rich, quality 
multimedia experiences to mobile subscribers on 3G and 4G networks." 
Starent was founded in 2000 and has about 1,000 employees worldwide. It reported revenue of 254 million 
dollars last year, up 74 percent from the previous year. 
Its products are used by more than 100 mobile operators in 45 countries. 
The acquisition of Starent is the latest major purchase in what has been a busy year for Cisco. 
Earlier this month, Cisco bid three billion dollars for Norwegian video-conference company Tandberg. 
In March, Cisco bought Pure Digital Technologies, maker of the hot-selling Flip Video camcorder, and it 
purchased Tidal Software Inc. the following month.

Cisco has offered to buy Tandberg, the Norwegian video conferencing company, for $3 billion in cash as part of 
its attempts to dominate the market for virtual business meetings. 
Cisco said it wanted to add to its high-end TelePresence video meeting service for executives and its WebEx 
meeting tool used by millions of office workers. The deal, Cisco's first acquisition of a public company outside the 
US, accelerates its push in video conferencing long championed by John Chambers, its chief executive. 
The video meeting market has received a boost from the recession as companies have cut travel budgets. 
Videoconferencing sales at both companies rose last year as customers bought more equipment. Cisco said last 
month that TelePresence sales rose 97 per cent from the previous year, without disclosing revenue. 
Tandberg's board has recommended the Cisco offer to its shareholders. Fredrik Halvorsen, the chief executive, 
told investors that large shareholders had voiced support for the offer of NKr153.50 a share. Mr Halvorsen will 
continue to lead the unit if the acquisition goes through. 
Cisco's approach could trigger offers from rivals including Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, according to analysts. 
TelePresence provides an "immersive experience", using furniture, cameras and giant screens to make users feel 
they are meeting in the same room. Some systems can cost more than $250,000. 
Tandberg has a range of gear, including high-definition video systems, that can sit on desks or be used with 
personal computers. The company also provides sales, support and other services in more than 90 countries. 
Cisco estimates the market, from online video chat to high-end virtual business meetings, to be worth $34 billion. 
Oslo-based Tandberg, which has 1,500 employees, had $808.8 million in sales last year. 
Shares in Tandberg, which had almost doubled in value this year on takeover speculation, were 11 per cent 
higher at the offer price of NKr153.5 by late afternoon, having traded at up to NKr156 earlier in the day. Cisco 
shares closed down nearly 2 per cent. JPMorgan is advising Tandberg and Lazard is advising Cisco. 
Martin Hoff of Arctic Securities said Cisco had offered a good price. "But the bid will stand for four weeks and 
there might be other offers," he added. 
Nordea Markets analyst Andre Adolfsen said there was a small chance of competing bids, including from Cisco's 
rival Hewlett-Packard.

NEW YORK/OSLO (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc struck a deal to buy Norwegian 
videoconferencing company Tandberg for $3 billion in a bid to dominate the high-growing market of corporate 
video communications. 
Analysts said the move ratchets up competition, and possibly more deals among video conferencing providers 
like Hewlett-Packard Inc and Polycom, and underscores Cisco's focus on video conferencing which enables 
workers everywhere to interact with colleagues and customers online. 
The acquisition of Tandberg, a market leader in video conferencing, helps Cisco fill the gap between its high-end 
TelePresence video meeting service for executives and its WebEx online meeting software used by millions of 
office workers. 
Tandberg offers a variety of desktop and other mid-range products. Its units sell for around $7,500 each, while 
Cisco's TelePresence units cost about $250,000. 
Jefferies analyst Bill Choi said the combined company would have close to 50 percent market share, and the deal 
would help Cisco speed up growth of its video business. 
"We always expected Cisco to move downstream and this acquisition accelerates its time-to-market by at least 18 
to 24 months," Choi said. 
Cisco sees video conferencing driving sales of routers and switches, which help direct Internet traffic and are its 
traditional bread and butter. Online, high-resolution video requires ample bandwidth as well as advanced network 
equipment to ensure smooth connections. 
"They realize that if they don't find new purposes for the network they're going to get commoditized," said Gartner 
analyst Ken Dulaney. 
Tandberg said its board has recommended the Cisco offer to its shareholders and Chief Executive Fredrik 
Halvorsen said major shareholders had voiced support for the cash offer of 153.50 Norwegian crowns ($26.49) a 
share. Halvorsen will continue to lead the unit if the acquisition goes through. 
GROWING MARKET 
Shares of Tandberg, which had almost doubled in value this year on takeover speculation, closed 11 percent 
higher at the offer price of 153.5 crowns on Thursday. Cisco's shares fell 45 cents, or 1.91 percent, to close at 
$23.09 on Nasdaq. 
Video conferencing has taken time to gain traction, but faster Internet speeds and pressure to cut corporate travel 
have helped boost adoption in recent years. Cisco last quarter said revenue from TelePresence nearly doubled 
from a year earlier, even as router revenue fell 27 percent. 
Cisco estimates the total value of collaboration tools, including everything from videoconferencing to conference 
calls to Google Apps, to be worth about $34 billion. 
Most analysts said a rival bid was not expected, although they did not rule it out. Potential suitors include HP, 
which is also active in Web collaboration. The market has also linked telecoms gear maker Ericsson with 
Tandberg. 
DnB NOR Markets in a report on Thursday cited Juniper, International Business Machines Corp, Sony Corp and 
Siemens.

Page 90 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The latest offer values Tandberg at about 23 times 2010 earnings, analysts say, slightly above U.S. rival 
Polycom's multiple of 21.7. 
Analysts said the deal puts pressure on Polycom and other Tandberg rivals, particularly Radvision, which sells 40 
percent of its products through a partnership with Cisco. 
Radvision shares fell 32.8 percent while Polycom fell 4.4 percent, even though CEO Robert Hagerty told Reuters 
Polycom could be an acquisition target. 
MORE AGGRESSIVE 
The acquisition would be Cisco's biggest since it bought WebEx for $3.2 billion in 2007, and follows its purchase 
of Flip Video digital camcorder maker Pure Digital Technologies. 
Such deals have been crucial to Cisco, which has grown from a company with $1.2 billion in annual revenue to 
around $40 billion since John Chambers took the CEO role in January 1995. Chambers said Cisco, which had a 
cash pile of $35 billion as of July 25, would step up the pace. 
"You're going to see us more aggressive over the next 12 months than you have seen us as a company," he said. 
"We will be very aggressive with internal start-ups, partnering ... and also in acquisitions." 
Technology merger activity is picking up as the market improves. PC maker Dell Inc recently bought IT services 
firm Perot Systems, and software maker Oracle Corp bought hardware firm Sun Microsystems Inc. 
Cisco said it hopes to close the deal in the first half of 2010, subject to regulatory approval. Antitrust lawyers said 
the deal would give the company a broad portfolio that rivals would struggle to match and that regulators could 
take a close look at the deal, but most said it would likely get through.

Cisco Systems Inc. agreed to buy Norway-based Tandberg ASA for about $3 billion, expanding its push into 
video conferencing systems that help people work together from different locations. 
The deal, announced early Thursday, is an all-cash tender offer that Cisco characterized as an 11% premium to 
Tandberg's closing price Wednesday. 
The move allows Cisco to use utilize some of its $35 billion in cash reserves and steps up competition with 
Hewlett-Packard Co., which like Cisco sells high-end video-conferencing systems to businesses. H-P also resells 
some Tandberg video systems. 
Tandberg, which reported revenue of $809 million in 2008, makes a range of video-conferencing products, 
including high-end systems that compete with Cisco's and video software that runs on a personal computer. 
The acquisition "instantly expands our portfolio of high-end video products to go from the desktop to the 
boardroom," said Ned Hooper, Cisco's chief strategy officer. 
High-end telepresence is still a small market, with world-wide sales of the big, multiscreen systems in which Cisco 
specializes still less than $500 million a year, according to an estimate by Wainhouse Research. But it's one of 
the few technologies that has benefited from the recession, rising 30% from last year as businesses look to 
reduce travel expenses. 
Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said he will move Cisco's telepresence business under TandbergCEO 
Fredrik Halvorsen. 
"Fredrik has almost an unlimited blank check," Mr. Chambers said. "This isn't a matter of synergies or cutting 
costs."

(c) 2009 Electronics International Disclaimer: Whilst every effort has been taken to ensure the accuracy of the 
information contained in this report, neither Electronics International nor its agents or sources can be held 
responsible for any inaccuracy. 
[Editorial Comment: The announcement that Cisco has bid NKR 153.5 per share in cash (approximately $2.98 
billion) for TANDBERG of Oslo, Norway, a 1,500-employee supplier of open standards videoconferencing 
systems, with customers including Ericsson and Bayer, is of interest for many different reasons.] [Firstly it ends an 
almost six month hiatus in Cisco acquisitions since the company announced it planned to acquire intelligent 
application management and automation solutions specialist Tidal Software.] [Shortly before that, in March 2009, 
Cisco announced that it would pay around $590 million for Pure Digital Technologies of San Francisco, a 
company founded in 2001 by Jonathan Kaplan and whose compact Flip Video-branded camcorder has sold two 
million units since its launch in May 2007.] [While Cisco's acquisition of Pure Digital Technologies is usually 
described as part of its 'consumer' strategy; it would probably be better described as a 'home networking' 
strategy. 
It is worth noting that it is conceivable Cisco sees this as a medium-term (3-5 year) stepping stone into the mobile 
market, perhaps through adding wireless and other functionality to the product while shrinking the camcorder.] 
[However, on its own the TANDBERG initiative does not answer most of the questions relating from that hiatus, 
including:] [- Why did Cisco prefer to accumulate cash during the downturn rather than buy companies?] [- Why 
does the company continue to say that it plans to be very aggressive on acquisitions when it has not been so?] 
[One possible reason for the hiatus, based on exchanges between John Chambers and Ned Hooper in the 
company's August audio conference for its fourth quarter results, could be that Cisco waited too long during the 
downturn before making any acquisitions, so that prices started to rise again with the recovery, plus perhaps 
Hooper is trying impose more discipline as regards the prices the company pays for its acquisitions.] [More and 
more Cisco is buying mature companies with significant sales rather than the small early stage production or just 
pre-production companies it typically used to buy.] [Does this mean it has decided the small company approach 
has not delivered? Alternatively, does the company see a widening gap between the projected sales growth of its 
legacy systems and the level of future sales implied by its target of 12-17% CAGR - a gap that can only be filled 
by large acquisitions?] [Secondly, given that TANDBERG is primarily a supplier of business systems it is 
somewhat inconsistent with the announcement made at a Cisco audio conference early in 2009 that the market 
could expect a number of consumer-related acquisitions in 2009.] [TANDBERG does support individual PC 
systems for company and SOHO markets, but there has been no suggestion that it is ready to launch a 
mass-market videoconferencing system, though it is always possible Cisco has something like that in mind - the 
company has talked in the past of providing a desktop system for $1,000.] [TANDBERG offers an open 
videoconferencing system which, according to its CEO Fredrik Halvorsen, means the company "has taken a 
community approach to not lock anyone out of the meeting", adding that "the TANDBERG telepresence server is 
a unique differentiator for the company, enabling connectivity with Microsoft Office Communications Server clients 
and immersive, third-party telepresence systems that may be at partner or supplier locations" (this approach 
would seem at odds with Cisco's proprietary approach).] [According to Wainhouse Research, TANDBERG had a 
40% share of the global business videoconferencing market in the second quarter of 2009, when the company 
reported sales of $204.6 million. If correct this implies a second quarter annualised global market of around $2 
billion and a Cisco acquisition price of 1.5x the annual market, 3.65x second quarter annualised sales and 17.2x 
second quarter annualised operating profit.] [The price being offered for TANDBERG makes a nonsense of John 
Chambers claim early in 2009 that Cisco had slowed its acquisition program because prices were dropping. Over 
the past 12 months TANDBERG's share price has risen from a low of NKR 57 in October 2008 to a pre-offer price 
of NKR 138.30. Even towards the end of the first quarter of 2009, shortly after Chambers made this comment, 
TANDBERG shares were available for around NKR 90. By this measure it would appear Cisco has ended up 
paying $1 billion more than it needed to!] [TANDBERG's sales over the last ten quarters, up to the second quarter 
of 2009, have risen fairly steadily, from $128.5 million at the start of the period to a peak of $225.5 million in fourth 
quarter of 2008, before falling to $193.3 million in the first quarter and rising again to $204.6 million in the second 
quarter of 2009.] [Over the same period GPMs remained reasonably stable, going from 67.2% at the start of the 
period to a low of 65.5%, peaking at 66.6% in the fourth quarter of 2008 and dropping to 66.1% in the most recent

Page 93 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
quarter.] [These figures give TANDBERG 2008/2007 sales growth of 28.3%, first half 2009 / first half 2008 sales 
growth of 6.7%, and second quarter 2009 / first quarter 2009 sales growth of 5.8% (25.3% on an annualised 
basis).] [Concerning Cisco's telepresence business, since the product was launched in October 2006 Cisco has 
provided teaser information only, although perhaps surprisingly describing it as one of the company's most 
successful products ever. John Chambers in particular has chosen to act as a personal advocate for the product, 
perhaps risking his role as impartial manager of the whole business.] [In April 2008 Cisco announced that after 18 
months it had accumulated an order book for around 500 telepresence systems which, together with 200 
implemented internally and other "philanthropic" systems, added up to about 750 systems in total.] [In January 
2009 Cisco was reported as expecting annual telepresence sales of around $1 billion by 2011.] [During its fourth 
quarter 2008/9 audio conference in August, Cisco announced that TelePresence revenue had risen 97% year on 
year, and in September in a major release about new TelePresence products and features, Cisco stated:] [- 
"TelePresence is Cisco's fastest-growing new product category with more than 350 customers and 2,500 systems 
deployed worldwide. In addition, Cisco has installed more than 600 Cisco TelePresence rooms on its own internal 
network for greater internal and external productivity and effective collaboration".] [If we assume telepresence 
sales in 2009 of around $450 million*, the acquisition of TANDBERG, with its approximately $800 million of 
annual sales and reputed 40% market share, would take Cisco's post acquisition market share to over 60%, 
leading to the question - will U.S. regulators accept this?] [To summarise, Cisco has offered to pay an 11% 
premium on TANDBERG's pre-offer capitalisation.] [As regards TANDBERG, although its second quarter sales 
showed a declining year on year growth rate - possibly because of Cisco competition - on a sequential basis 
growth seems to have resumed. Meanwhile TANDBERG has been able to maintain its very high margins of 
around 66%, which does not suggest it felt it was under too much pressure.] [In his comments on the second 
quarter results, Fredrik Halvorsen commented, "The company has focused on the network and telepresence 
markets, resulting in increased market share". This is not consistent with the kind of growth we have hypothesised 
for Cisco in this market, which one would expect to have hurt TANDBERG.] [One explanation for this is that while 
the companies operate in the same general market, they have not engaged in much in head-to-head competition. 
This could be either because the market is so new there is enough business that they do not need to compete, or 
they are serving different segments.] [TANDBERG, in its quarterly reports, refers to the number of 'endpoints' 
shipped, for example in the second quarter it sold 15,663 endpoint units (giving an average price per endpoint of 
around $13,062). Strangely, the number of endpoints sold was down 5% year on year even though sales were up 
5%.] [TANDBERG seems to be primarily interested in company-wide videoconferencing systems that enable 
one-to-one or small group conferencing from the desktop.] [Cisco, on the other hand, seems to be concentrating 
on group-to-group conferencing between purpose-equipped meeting rooms, and measures its market in a much 
smaller number of systems sold (with its internal sales further complicating the issue).] [No doubt the two 
companies compete to some extent, but the fact that their markets are largely separate could be the basis for 
Cisco's argument that the U.S. regulators should approve the deal.] [Even so, none of this explains Cisco's 
somewhat strange behaviour with respect to acquisitions over the last 12 months - saying one thing in public then 
executing quite differently and without any explanation, at least at the public level.] [* The telepresence market 
size numbers are problematic. However assuming that the average price of the 2,500 external systems installed 
by Cisco was $250,000 per system and the average price of the internally installed systems was half that, then 
the company's cumulative sales to the end of August 2009 would be $700 million, around $850 million to the end 
of 2009.] [With few sales in 2006 and bearing in mind 'doubling' of sales between 2008 and 2009, the following 
might be a reasonable approximation of actual sales from 2006 to the end of 2009: $25 million (2006); $125 
million; $250 million; $450 million (2009).] [If the TANDBERG deal goes through, Cisco will clearly be well ahead 
of its prediction of $1 billion in sales by 2011; it will have taken a modest step towards closing the gap between 
actual sales and the 12-17% CAGR target.]

October 1st Cisco Systems has announced a definitive agreement to launch a recommended voluntary cash offer 
to acquire TANDBERG of Oslo, Norway and New York: 
a. A supplier of telepresence, videoconferencing, network infrastructure and mobile video products and services, 
with offices in 34 countries and more than 1,500 employees worldwide. 
b. Having reported 2008 revenues of $808.8 million, up 28% on the previous year, operating profit of $176.7 
million and a cash balance at the end of the year of $174.8 million. 
c. Claiming market share leadership in videoconferencing endpoints and infrastructure, an installed base in over 
90 countries and customers including over half of the Fortune 50, 21 of the 25 world's largest banks, and 65 of the 
top 100 universities. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Cisco will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all the outstanding 
shares of TANDBERG for 153.5 Norwegian Kroner per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 
$3.0 billion. 
This represents an 11.0% premium to the previous day closing price of TANDBERG's stock, and a 25.2% 
premium to the 3-month volume weighted average closing price for TANDBERG's stock. 
The acquisition, recommended unanimously by TANDBERG's board of directors, is expected to close during the 
first half of calendar year 2010 and is expected to be accretive to Cisco's non-GAAP earnings in fiscal year 2011. 
With the proposed acquisition, Cisco said it would integrate TANDBERG's video endpoints and network 
infrastructure solution into its collaboration architecture, thus expanding its portfolio to reach a greater number of 
customers. 
TANDBERG's Norway operations will be positioned as a European centre of video excellence alongside Cisco's 
existing Service Provider video team in Diegem, Belgium. 
Also, upon completion of the transaction, TANDBERG's CEO Fredrik Halvorsen will lead the new TelePresence 
Technology Group, reporting to Marthin De Beer, SVP of Cisco's Emerging Technologies Group. 
John Chambers, Chairman and CEO of Cisco, was quoted as saying: 
- "Cisco and TANDBERG have remarkably similar cultures and a shared vision to change the way the world 
works through collaboration and video communications technologies". 
- "Collaboration is a $34 billion market and is growing rapidly - enabled by networked Web 2.0 technologies". 
- "This acquisition showcases Cisco's financial strength and ability to quickly capture key market transitions for 
growth".

Cisco Steps Up Rivalry With H-P --- Deal to Buy Tandberg for $3 Billion Comes as Giants Push Video Conferencing

Cisco Steps Up Rivalry With H-P --- Deal to Buy Tandberg for $3 Billion Comes as Giants Push Video 
Conferencing

Cisco Systems Inc.'s $3 billion deal to buy Tandberg ASA of Norway expands the Silicon Valley company's push 
into video-conferencing, and escalates a growing rivalry with Hewlett-Packard Co. 
The all-cash deal, announced early Thursday, follows a push by the networking-equipment company into 30 new 
businesses that it says can each produce $1 billion a year in revenue. 
Among the new products is "telepresence," video-conferencing systems that use large, high-definition televisions 
to create a life-like effect. H-P also sells a telepresence system, and the companies' systems don't work with one 
another. 
World-wide sales of such big, multiscreen systems total less than $500 million a year, according to an estimate by 
Wainhouse Research. But the market is growing quickly, and adds to a series of battlefields between two tech 
giants that once had a cozy relationship. 
H-P recently has stepped up investment in its own line of networking gear, and Cisco earlier this year unveiled its 
own server system, a category where H-P dominates. 
Telepresence is one of the few technologies that has benefited from the recession, growing 30% from last year as 
businesses look to reduce travel expenses, according to Wainhouse. 
But these high-end systems account for just 3% of all the video-conferencing units sold in 2009, according 
research company TeleSpan Publishing. 
Cisco's and H-P's high-end products don't work with many video-conferencing systems and new PC-based ones, 
said Elliot Gold, TeleSpan's president, though H-P says its high-end systems are compatible with most Tandberg 
gear. 
Without that interoperability "it's just not enough end points," he said. "It's as if Cisco invented a new telephone 
that didn't work with existing phones -- there'd be no calls." 
Tandberg, which reported revenue of $809 million in 2008, makes a range of video-conferencing products, 
including high-end hardware that competes with Cisco's and systems that run on personal computers. It also 
makes software so different conferencing systems can communicate with one another. 
Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said he will move Cisco's telepresence business under TandbergCEO 
Fredrik Halvorsen. "Fredrik has almost an unlimited blank check," Mr. Chambers said on a conference call. "This 
isn't a matter of synergies or cutting costs." 
Tandberg sold 33.3% of all video-conferencing units in the second quarter of 2009, according to TeleSpan, 
trailing only Polycom Inc., which sold 44.3% of units. No other company had more than 6% of the market. 
The acquisition "instantly expands our portfolio of high-end video products to go from the desktop to the 
boardroom," said Ned Hooper, Cisco's chief strategy officer. 
Cisco's goal, Mr. Hooper said, is to make video a key part of communication for small businesses as well as large 
ones, and eventually for consumers.

H-P is making a similar bet. Earlier this year, the computer maker transferred its teleconference unit out of its 
printing division and into H-P's networking unit, where it is now pushed by a division that has 20,000 sales 
representatives. 
H-P also has been reselling Tandberg gear to expand its offerings -- a practice that will continue "for the 
foreseeable future," a spokeswoman said. And this month H-P introduced new software called SkyRoom that can 
turn a PC into a video-conferencing system. 
Cisco's deal with Tandberg could present an opportunity for the remaining pure-play video-conferencing 
companies to forge an alliance with the computer maker. "It's a great opportunity to get in there and talk to H-P," 
said Bob Hagerty, Polycom's CEO. 
Cisco has $35 billion in cash, but $29 billion is overseas and can't be spent in the U.S. without a large tax penalty. 
The deal for Tandberg was made with its overseas reserves, said Mr. Hooper. 
Cisco said it will launch a tender offer, which Tandberg's board recommended. The offer could still be topped by 
a rival bid. Cisco said it expects the deal to close in the first half of calendar year 2010.

Cisco takes over Tandberg to target video conferencing

Silicon Valley technology empire Cisco is paying $3bn (pounds 1.8bn) to swallow Tandberg, a Norwegian 
specialist in video conferencing, in a deal intended to tap global demand for more cost-effective international 
business meetings in cyberspace. 
Cisco is spending a portion of its $35bn cash pile on the takeover. Tandberg brings an expertise in affordable, 
middle-market online conferencing to Cisco's high-end executive boardroom tools. 
John Chambers, chief executive of Cisco, has promised to create technology hubs in video conferencing at 
Tandberg's headquarters in Oslo and at the Norwegian firm's British base in Staines, Middlesex, which employs 
600 people. 
"We saw an opportunity to hit a tipping point in the collaboration market," said Chambers, who described 
Tandberg as a "Silicon Valley company in Norway" with a natural cultural fit. 
Established in 1933, Tandberg began as a radio factory. The group split in 1979, hiving off its television and data 
arms, and launched its first product for "small group" video meetings in 1989. It employs 1,500 people and is 
listed on the Oslo stock exchange. 
Tandberg's chief executive, Fredrik Halvorsen, said the takeover was a "validation" of the firm's facilities in 
Norway and Britain as "centres of excellence and innovation". Key products in Tandberg's range include desktop 
video units and PC-based conferencing, plus more elaborate "Telepresence" systems, which use huge 
high-definition screens to make participants feel they are in the same room. 
Cisco is likely to plug its own networking technology into Tandberg's products. Richard Windsor, an analyst at 
Nomura in London, said: "Cisco has a very, very good code which compresses video stream. If they put that into 
Tandberg's systems, it will improve performance." 
The cash offer is for NKr153.5 (pounds 16.54) per Tandberg share, an 11% premium to the pre-deal market price 
of Tandberg's stock. Windsor said Tandberg was generously valued, with its shares trading on a multiple of 23 
times future earnings, in comparison to its technological peers. 
Cisco's move came amid signs of a revival in takeover activity in the hi-tech industry. Xerox paid $6.4bn this week 
for an IT consulting firm, Affiliated Computer Services, and Dell recently offered $3.9bn for IT provider Perot 
Systems.

SOFTWARE 
Deal extends video conferencing offer 
Fresh challenge to industry leaders 
Cisco made a $3bn cash offer for Tandberg, a Norwegian video-conferencing company, yesterday, throwing 
down another challenge to Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard as it pushes deeper into the online collaboration 
business. 
The business collaboration market, which includes everything from document-sharing software to video 
conferencing, is worth about $34bn, according to Cisco. 
The acquisition is the largest since the US network equipment maker's $3.2bn cash purchase of online 
collaboration company Webex in 2007 , and is set to round out its portfolio of video, messaging and other 
collaboration tools. 
Cisco has heavily promoted its high-end "telepresence" systems, which are designed to bring an almost lifelike 
quality to video conferences, but has lacked a wider range of conferencing products, including ones for desktop 
computers. 
HP, which had also focused on high-end systems, last week unveiled SkyRoom, a desktop video conferencing 
product aimed at the mass market. 
The acquisition of Tandberg will plug the gap for Cisco, while also bringing network-based switching technology 
which makes it possible for video-conferencing systems made by different IT companies to work alongside one 
another, said Ned Hooper, Cisco's chief strategy officer. This technology is considered key as it would allow 
companies using different systems to hold online conferences with each other. 
Tandberg itself makes a virtue of its ability to connect with Microsoft's conferencing and communications 
technology, which could further increase tensions between Cisco and Microsoft, traditional partners which have 
found themselves increasingly in conflict as they both converge on the online collaboration market. 
The acquisition of Tandberg, which generated revenues of $809m last year, leaves Polycom, a US-based video 
conferencing company, as the only sizeable independent in the market. 
The Cisco offer has been recommended by Tandberg's board and follows reports of other acquisition approaches 
, which have served to push the company's shares higher. 
Cisco's tender offer, of NKr153.5 for each Tandberg share, represents an 11 per cent premium to the closing 
price on Wednesday, but a 25.2 per cent premium to the three-month weighted average for the stock, the 
companies said. 
The purchase will take only a small bite out of Cisco's $35bn mountain of cash and investments, which John 
Chambers, chief executive officer , has said would be used partly to make strategic acquisitions.Video

conferencing accounts for only $4bn of the current $34bn collaboration market but is expected to eat into more 
traditional voice services, said Mr Hooper.

Cisco Makes Recommended Offer to Acquire TANDBERG Presentation - Final 
Cisco Makes Recommended Offer to Acquire TANDBERG Presentation - Final

1 October 2009 
CQ FD Disclosure 
FNDW 
English

JOHN CHAMBERS, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.: Good day. I know we're on in a number of 
different locations. 
This is literally how both Fredrik and I run our businesses. It's the ability to change the way that you communicate 
with your own employees, change the way you can communicate with your customers, industry analysts, et 
cetera. So it's a chance for us to share with you what the announcement today meant to us; share first from 
Fredrik's side and my side about the business overall, and then turn it to our two colleagues to talk about 
expanding that down in terms of technology and where does it go. 
But I want to start off by saying one thing -- the most exciting area of technology today for me is all around 
collaboration and video architecture. I think it will literally change a decade of productivity. I think it's a $34 billion 
market that is going to grow very, very rapidly. I think it will change business models, and we ourselves are 
completely changing the corporate structure to match these comments that I just made. 
That when we talk together with customers who h ad Cisco and TANDBERG, without exception, it was amazing. 
If Fredrik's team went in first, they helped sell our Cisco gear, whether they realized it or not. And Fredrik was 
very kind, saying, John, you are my best salesman -- and I wasn't sure at first was that a compliment or not; but 
what it said is that our customers saw very quickly that what Cisco brought was a collaborative architecture, 
high-end TelePresence capabilities, et cetera, and how do you transform business? 
What TANDBERG did an amazing job on is the mid-level and the video communications to the desktop, open 
standards, open architecture, and an ability, actually, for the two combinations to play very well across our 
customer environments. 
So when we began to look at this combination, we saw an opportunity to hit a tipping point in the collaboration 
market, to dramatically accelerate both for us, but candidly, for the industry as a whole, and to make our first 
acquisition of a public company outside the US that matched our culture, shared vision, matched the same 
attitude toward commitment to a country, and a willingness to be aggressive to catch these market transitions. 
If you watch what causes acquisitions to be successful, it's where you have shared vision; it's where you are able 
to keep the employees; it's where you have a clear definition of roles. You're able to have similar culture and 
geographic proximity. So we're only missing one element of what we normally find. 
But most of all, what I like about what we found at TANDBERG is their focus on the customers. It was like you 
were talking to Cisco people -- we actually can finish each other's sentences, in terms of the direction, and a 
commitment to really change an industry together. 
So the terms of the agreement is about a $3 billion transaction, NOK153.5. That's about a 25% premium to what 
the stock has been over the last 90 days' moving average. It's a 38% premium from when we started talking just 
early in July, and I've got a [niche], your stock, Fredrik, has outperformed ours. You were up 200% this last year. 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN, CEO, TANDBERG: Yes. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: So it is a company that we're very excited about being a part of, and has shown the 
capabilities to move markets and make a difference. So, while TelePresence has exceeded my highest 
expectations in terms of our own success, we will take the TelePresence organization and the exchange 
organization and report it into Fredrik. 
So we're going to form a center of excellence for all of video here in Norway and in London, that we're taking the 
project that, personally, is one that I'm most excited about, and I think, Marthin, you as well. And we're going to 
transfer the resources there and come with an entire architecture, in terms of the collaboration market -- first with

Page 101 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
video and then tied it into what we're doing with WebEx and what we're doing with IP telephony, and what we're 
doing with the flip capability itself. 
So, bottom line is, we think we have made an industry transformation move today. The further we get into the 
culture of the exchange with the people, the more comfortable we get with that. And with that, let me turn to you, 
Fredrik. 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: Okay, well, thank you, John, and to you as well, Marthin. I guess I speak for the whole 
organization when I say we are very excited to join you and your teams to make this happen. 
You know, we see this as a validation, right? Not only for TANDBERG, but of our people, our technology, and not 
at least Norway and the UK, and Europe, as a center of excellence in the relation. 
What struck us in going through this -- and I think it was twofold -- number one, how similar our relations are at 
the heart, the core of the vision for most companies is this notion of changing the way people communicate and 
collaborate, and we see Cisco having a very bold mission in that space. 
The other thing that was very attractive was the way Cisco has an excellent track record in integrating expertise 
and in accelerating market developments. So I think we came to a point where we saw that the timing was right to 
join forces. As John pointed out to you, we've heard this from our customers, but I'm also today hearing it from my 
own employees; as we go around in the all-hands meetings, they are all smiles, from sales to engineering. 
The ability to put that joint talent of these two companies together I think will do a lot more generation than either 
company could have done on their own. And I really think, as well, on the sales side, people are now excited 
about the type of global footprints that we can get to leverage and bring to our customers. So I think that sums it 
up at the high level for me. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: You know, what was fun was watching yours and your chairman's PDA and phones go off 
today, which just notes back to the shareholders saying, smart deal; really love it; well done. 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: Yes. No, I think we -- I should probably thank -- if there are investors on this call, all our 
major investors that have already given their blessing to the deal. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: So let me turn it to you, Marthin. 
MARTHIN DE BEER, SVP OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES GROUP, CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.: Thanks, John. 
And let me pick up from what Fredrik just said. I'm equally excited, Fredrik, to have you become part of the Cisco 
family. 
And this morning, when we did the all-hands, I could just sense the passion in the room -- you know, not unlike 
the kind of passion I've seen across the TelePresence team at Cisco. And I think putting these two teams 
together will continue to evolve and further the vision we have as to what's possible with this technology. 
You know, it's a very exciting time, because from a technology perspective, the network as a platform is ready for 
high definition video. And what Cisco is doing is creating an interim architecture that will span not just within 
business to reach across geographies, but will enable companies to reach out to their customers, their suppliers 
and their partners, using this technology, and truly do business in a brand-new way. 
So the business-to-business aspect of this architectural approach is very important. And, of course, that 
business-to-business exchange is run by some of the largest service providers in the world, companies like AT&T, 
BT, Telmex, [Topdot] Systems, and others. 
And we're really excited about -- as we then, later on, move into the consumer space as well with this technology 
and, of course, the TANDBERG acquisition, give us that full range of technologies and endpoints all the way from 
the Boardroom to the desktop; but as we later on move into the consumer space, business-to-consumer business 
models, and consumer-to-consumers will also be able to leverage what we are both acquiring here as well as 
what we can build together. 
So, enabling people around the world to leverage face-to-face communication in a brand-new way, but to have 
the experience be so good that you can see the expression in someone's eye, you can build trust relationships, 
and you can maintain relationships over long-distance, truly will be the enabler of virtual business 
communications. And that's what we're really excited about. Hakon?

Page 102 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
HAKON DAHLE, CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST, TANDBERG: Yes. We're quite excited, too. So we're actually quite 
proud of what we have accomplished over the last 15 to 20 years. We have a great range of endpoints, as we 
mentioned, high definition from the desktop all the way to the Boardroom. 
We have probably the best infrastructure offering in the industry for high definition video, and we have our 
management systems and our software technologies, which all fits very nicely together with an architecture based 
on the network, on collaboration, and unified communications as well as messaging. So I think together, in this 
family, we can do lots of great things. 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: Yes, one more comment. You're being very humble, Hakon, because TANDBERG has 
tremendously powerful technology that enable interoperability really across the board for any endpoint -- not just 
the Cisco and TANDBERG endpoints, but really endpoints that come from any supplier or any vendor out there. 
And that will benefit our customers in a tremendous way, and will really enable Metcalfe's law, so that the more 
systems we can connect across the network as a platform, the value of that system then just increased by the 
square of the number of endpoints. So it's really exciting to see what that can do for business then at the end of 
the day. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I think it will accelerate not just our business; it will accelerate 
our peers and our competitors business. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Right. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: So, Ned, do you want to add any comments before we jump into open questions? 
NED HOOPER, SVP OF CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER GROUP, CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.: 
Thanks. So you know, I don't have a whole lot to add. I think you guys covered it very well, but we've been 
working very closely with the TANDBERG team now for a period of time. And I can just reaffirm that the 
commonality and culture and vision around the market opportunity has been absolutely fantastic and I think we're 
already good friends. And now coming together, I think we have a leadership team and a technical capability 
that's going to be first in the industry and going to enable us to succeed long-term. 
You know, it's -- when we look at M&A and when we look at our history of M&A, it's always fun to be here at the 
announcement of the deals, but success is made over time, based on the integration and the quality of the team, 
and the ability to go to Version 2, Version 3, Version 4 of the product sets. And we've got a great team in place to 
go do that, and we're very, very excited about the market opportunity and what we can do together. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: You know very quickly in the process, as you go through this with a little bit of stress, is the 
match really going to be good or is it going to be great? This one's going to be great. 
Pretty uniform today across the group. We spent time with the employees. The Chairman of TANDBERG and I 
both raised Fredrik's goal twice during the discussions; but it also shows how well our teams are interfacing in 
terms of us moving key executives. And we will have an exchange program among the areas. 
So, this is a huge commitment to Europe, a huge commitment to Norway and the UK, and my favorite project. 
So with that, let's open it up and take the conversation wherever the group would like to go. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Great. So, actually, our first question comes from the Web, a 
question from Dow Jones -- How does this deal affect Cisco's effort to get TelePresence into SMBs, smaller 
enterprises and the consumer?" 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I think if you look where video communications both for interfacing to customers, interfacing 
to your supply chain, interfacing to your peers, the area that will benefit the most over time will be actually small to 
medium business. 
As most of us know, the majority of job growth, as the economy comes back, will be small to medium, and the 
ability to make it easy to use with an architectural approach becomes very key. And Fredrik and I both had the 
chance today to sit down and re-prepare the video for his small channel partners, to not only reassure them about 
Cisco as a major channel organization who won most of the awards, but to assure the AV and the VCs, and the 
systems integrators and the service providers, that together, we intend to stay really focused on the channel 
overall.

Page 103 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
So it's a nice way of saying, I think you're going to see this concept was started in the big companies and big 
service providers, very rapidly come down market, and it's one of the things that [candied] together, we can 
accomplish using other products as well, like WebEx and like the capability of unified communication and the flip, 
my new most favorite product, on a regular basis. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Great, great. Anybody else care to add to that? 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: Yes, maybe just one quick comment. When you think about TANDBERG's endpoints, 
that has very strong capabilities at the desktop, and also very attractive price points, I think those will play very 
well into small or medium businesses. 
But the power here is when you then tie that in with what we do in the exchange, with service providers, you can 
do business with big companies that have the higher end systems. So Cisco today has a good position on the 
very high end of the market; TANDBERG covers the rest of the range. And so you put the two together across 
exchanges, and it enables small and medium businesses to really use the technology to do business in a new 
way. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: So what you're talking about is the capability -- let's use the flip as an example -- to capture 
high-definition TV, to be able to do that on a personal basis or a business basis -- this is how I blog; this is how I 
summarize sessions -- finish it up; be able to play it back with high-definition capability; plug it into any PC over 
time, any phone, and you suddenly begin to move videos throughout the network in ways that couldn't be done 
before. And this is where media net ties together, so you could almost play out the hand. 
We started with very basic video with our acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta. We looked at how you added that when 
we did WebEx. We looked at what we did from a security point of view. Then we began to expand it with the flip, 
and now you talk with TANDBERG. You see an architectural play that pretty closely ties it all together. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: We're going to go to Boston for our next question. Boston? 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Abner Germinow of IC]. 
UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: John, you talked about it a minute ago, in terms of reaching out to the 
TANDBERG channel. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that. The TANDBERG channel has 
some overlap with Cisco but in many cases, has gone into the AV channel, and where do you put that channel in 
terms of the value of the deal? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Well, I think our ability to reach different customer sets, especially as you move down 
market, becomes extremely key. 
As you saw when we moved into IP telephony, our channels hit a certain range of high-end commercial and 
high-end enterprise, and candidly, we were very fortunate to get about 65% market share there. But as we all 
know, it's how do you have the channels aligned that bring this capability to small businesses, and over time, 
even to the consumer. 
So when you look at the assets that TANDBERG brings, they are almost all complementary, and we even 
describe the pie the same way. Rather than saying, how do we get a bigger percentage of the pie, we say, let's 
make the pie bigger. Then by definition, approach it that way. 
So I think the channel has become even more important on this distribution capability, but at the same time, we're 
really looking for the teams to build a video architecture that really ties into the next generation of collaboration. 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: Yes. No, maybe just to reiterate that, we have a large set of very loyal partners, 
everything from AV integrators and VC specialists up to the service providers. And it has been a very key topic of 
how we make sure this is a real win-win for everyone out there and how we create a real proposition that goes -- 
spans broader products and that goes deeper into the niches of different customer segments to make sure all of 
our channel partners get to benefit. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: So as you know, we can't do any joint sales operations until the deal is approved, and the 
same things with channels; so in the interim, our teams have to continue just like they were before. But you will 
watch us move very rapidly after the approval, which we expect sometime in the first half of next calendar year, to 
align our channel strategies and business strategies. And this is one of growth. It isn't like your trying to thin it 
down or make some -- make the deal work off of synergies by reducing resources.

Page 104 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Frederick has almost an unlimited blank check, and it's an opportunity to move very rapidly in that. Now, it's easy 
for me to say, because his margins are as good as mine (multiple speakers) [66%]. His Chairman has trained he 
and his team very well in terms of the balance; so it just gives you an idea of our optimism that if we actually write 
together, what this could mean to the industry and to Cisco and to TANDBERG. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Great. Our next question comes from Merrill Lynch-Bank of 
America. 
How long will it take to integrate TelePresence and TANDBERG, such that you could make calls between the two 
systems? 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: I can take a crack. Yes, maybe just let me give a caveat to that. I think, number one 
(multiple speakers) -- 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Now, watch this. This is how well we've learned to work together. You're going to have 
Fredrik distract you for a second. The guys over here are going to figure out the answer, and you're not going to 
see that that took any time in between. 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: There you go. So I was going to say that we're not obviously allowed to sort of fully 
collaborate until this thing is closed. But once it is, I'm sure we will try to move very rapidly to, again, make sure 
this becomes interoperable and standards-based. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Absolutely, and that is the goal. And I think the technologies 
are sufficiently similar that that task isn't that hard, and our goal is for full interoperability between multiple 
vendors. So (multiple speakers) -- 
JOHN CHAMBERS: And the multiple vendors is the keyword. That's one of the many things we are interested in 
that you have, is your open systems your open architecture. So if we were to bet $100 on when that will occur 
after the announcement date, are we talking six months, 12 months, three months? 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, let me put it simply (multiple speakers). For single-screen 
systems, at any solution that is standards-based video, interoperability should be a matter of testing. Maybe with 
a couple of tweaks, John, so that could be done in a matter of weeks. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Yes. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Coupling that with the [Cogient] platforms, the [MC] used that 
TANDBERG also has, again, that gives you immediate interoperability, even with systems that is legacy in nature 
in the installed base, that could be from not just TANDBERG but multiple companies. 
And then thirdly, for the large three-screen systems, where we actually combine screens together but a standard 
doesn't exist, that's where I think we'll probably need, what, a couple, three months worth of work to make sure 
we implement and test it. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, I think you're right. I think it's closer to three than six, and 
it's certainly not 12. 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: Yes, exactly. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Great. We're going to go to [Bethmont Lakes] for our next 
question, just outside of London. I believe we have a question from Richard Marney from Ovum. Richard? 
RICHARD MARNEY, ANALYST, OVUM: I was interested to see that TANDBERG had, I think, about 16% of 
revenue in services, and I wondered if you could give me a little bit more sort of detail in terms of what is in that 
revenue line. And I think -- what's the opportunity for Cisco in services around TelePresence? We've seen a 
fantastic growth in terms of not just the TelePresence, but the services that sits around the technology itself. So a 
few questions on both sides. 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: Very well. No, you're very right. We have 16% in services, and it is a good opportunity 
for us coming together. 
Our services are, I would say, of two natures. One is just basic maintenance services, and that constitutes about 
70% of it. The remainder are really softer upgrades, as we have all of our products on one platform and so forth. 
So we're able to basically give you that continuous upgrade path.

Page 105 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
When it comes to advanced services, spinning off a full architecture, which becomes more and more critical in 
delivering this from the desk all the way to the Boardrooms and across companies, I think there are some really 
good synergies. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I would agree. If you watch what has happened -- and I'm going to ask Marthin to break 
down our services business, versus our product business when we get the orders -- we found wherever we put 
professional services in place, the customer tends to buy about 50% more. So if they're growing at 10, they could 
grow at 15; if they were growing at 15, they grow at 22, 23. 
Customer satisfaction goes up, availability goes up, et cetera. So you will see us provide a thin layer of services 
across to all the architectures in the business process chains we do, and still, however, be an organization that 
will partner with probably 500,000 consultancy service partners from the Accenture's of the world, to the Web 
Pro's, to the [TaTa's], et cetera. 
Marthin, you know, I normally prefer you don't give them too much detail on the products, but without identifying 
anything positive or negative about this quarter, and nothing we say today should interpret anything about the 
quarter we are in, but give a feel for what the mix has been and the growth -- because you're growing in almost 
100% type range year-over-year with the products. How are services doing and what percentage of business is 
services? 
MARTHIN DE BEER: So we have quite a large installed base today with about [2,800] systems sold to about 430 
-- or sorry, 445 customers in total. And we've seen across the board, services representing about 40% of the 
overall product bookings and revenues. So it has been a very significant services business for us. In fact, the 
service attach rate here is probably higher than any other business inside of Cisco right now, John, because 
we've built it with services in mind from day one. 
And again, I think you probably won't see the same attach rate at the desktop that you would in a high-end room 
like the ones you're sitting in here, but across the board, if you deploy it as an architecture, I think the services 
attach rate will continue to be very high. 
RICHARD MARNEY: Do you feel overall that what you've acquired through TANDBERG, does give you new 
opportunity in some service aspects of what they do? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I think it's more important than new opportunity. I would look at this as a chance to build 
relationships across large accounts and small accounts alike, to become their partner in the whole collaboration 
move, way beyond just video communications. 
And video communications is the tip of the iceberg in collaboration, but it's the one the CEO or the CFO tends to 
focus on. And especially when you can lead with just real basic justification with transportation alone, paying for 
the systems more often than not, then you talk about how you reengineer your business models, et cetera. 
So it can be the area that really not only gets your foot in the door, it gets your foot into the boardroom, and then 
can pull through a lot of product areas behind it. Because collaboration for us, when you think about a $34 billion 
market, our products together are at a run rate of only about $1.2 billion. It gives you an idea how large this 
market is, and you add growth on top of that, you're going to see a whole bunch of really good competitors and 
peers in the market as well. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: If I can add to that, you know, today there is a broad range of 
collaboration technologies being used out there. We believe that video will become an increasingly larger part of 
all of the different collaboration segments. So it will extend well beyond just the face-to-face side of what we're 
talking about here, especially as it extends into the desktop, whether you think of WebEx or other kinds of 
collaboration technologies. 
High definition video will become an integral part of that, and that's why the broader opportunity is really the 
bigger one we think we will move towards over time. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay, thank you. We're going to go to Boston now to Andrew 
David -- Andrew Davis of Wainhouse. 
ANDREW DAVIS, ANALYST, WAINHOUSE RESEARCH: Hello. Thank you. Congratulations on a most 
interesting business deal. 
One of you earlier in the presentation used the word passion, and my experience and observation is, over the 
past couple of years, in the video space, both the Cisco sales force and the TANDBERG sales force have been

Page 106 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
incredibly passionate about their business and their products. And a result of that, they've been fierce competitors 
down at the sales level, to the point, quite frankly, where I think some relationships have been filled with some 
animosity. 
My question is, do you have any plans to address that? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Well, the reason we're laughing is, Fredrik, in the employee session today, I go walking 
through the organization to ask questions, 500 people in the room, and I, of course, feed the questions to Fredrik 
and Marthin from the floor, and one of the guys said exactly your question -- he said, John, you've been my best 
competitor for a long period of time; how do I get focused on somebody else? 
I immediately asked the person beside him to move out of the seat and we sat down, and he was about 60 
pounds bigger than me, and I said, well, first of all, you may not realize it, but each time you sold TANDBERG, I 
sold flip (inaudible) the TelePresence and the video architecture behind you, and vice versa. 
And what you'll find is, both of us were very effective with our sales organizations, but it wasn't personal. And as 
you look forward, the good news is we're going to have Microsoft and HP, and Huawei and Apple, and a whole 
bunch of competitors that will come into this space in an aggressive way. 
You will find at world-class sales organizations, they have respect for each other, whose products are going to be 
together, and they'll fall right into line. 
So I don't see that being as big a challenge perhaps as some of the areas you're going to be careful on as we 
move into the data center, where competition in that environment does tend to be pretty ferocious in a different 
way. 
I think you'll find our sales forces will immediately get this. In fact, they'll be -- we've got to keep them in check 
during the period of quietness because we can't work together until after it's done. I think that will actually one of 
the easier areas to implement. 
Now, Fredrik, I've watched you already. (multiple speakers) If you disagree, you jump right in and disagree, 
because that's part of our culture. 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: You know I will, but on this one, I really can't disagree. I think in just talking to our 
salespeople today [all day], they have a passion to compete and they love to compete and develop this niche, but 
as was just pointed out, this is [today] a run rate of $1.2 billion. It's really about expanding market, right, and 
reaching that tipping point. 
We firmly believe that, together, we can drive and accelerate that innovation, which will make that possible, will 
make it more robust, will make the user interfaces more intuitive and so forth, that the vision that both companies 
are so passionate about. 
So going from that to a $34 billion total opportunity, will create more than enough room for everyone. So yes, we'll 
come out of the block as one team as soon as regulatory is behind us. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay, thank you. Our next question comes from Reuters, from 
the Web. Did Cisco consider buying other videoconference providers? What was TANDBERG's biggest appeal? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I think it's fair to say, in today's market, with very few exceptions, almost every company that 
is for sale or is thinking about being for sale, we have a chance to evaluate. And that's a tremendous honor and it 
speaks to our ability to do acquisitions, keep the people, do a great job for the shareholders, a great job for the 
customers, et cetera. 
So there were a number of options in this area of the market, and the further we got into the options, there was 
one clear leader by the furthest pace. And it was TANDBERG and it was probably around four key areas. 
First, and I don't want to underplay this, their cultures are remarkably similar -- remarkably similar across sales, 
across engineering. You can put the groups in the room and you won't know one week later who was from which 
company. 
The second area was, the product overlap was very minimal, but yet the architecture covers the gamut. And you 
start with a very high-end TelePresence systems; you talk about how we had built a collaborative architecture that 
really enables innovation. And you fill it in with the midrange TANDBERG systems and the desktop TANDBERG

Page 107 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
systems, and what we both have in pipelines, and then you begin to think about video like this that we just kind of 
threw in just for a fun part, and the ability to do a media net. 
We can cover this collaborative architecture in a way that no other combination of two, three or four companies 
can do it. So the second part was the architecture. 
The third part that TANDBERG has, the third part was interoperability and openness. They have been in this 
business for 20 years. They built, a long time ago, how you interfaced to the Microsoft's and the Sony's of the 
world, and the Polycom's of the world, into it -- which allows us to get the power of the number of nodes squared. 
We still think we'll get way more than our share of the nodes, but it takes away that worry by some people about, 
do you get locked in? Or what do I do with my existing installed base? 
Having said all of the above, what we both do well -- our systems are used heavily. The average, quote -- old 
world videoconferencing room -- is utilized 2% to 3% of the time. Our systems tend to be utilized often 60%, 80%, 
90% of the available time, and that perhaps is the last takeaway. 
It's a feature-rich, easy-to-use, CEO/idiot-proof, and I'm the CEO that has to be able to operate it. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Great. Thank you. We're going to go back to [Bedfont]. 
DOMINIC DODD, ANALYST, FROST AND SULLIVAN: It's Dominic Dodd, Frost and Sullivan. I'd like to join 
Andrew in congratulating you. I think the logic behind this acquisition is very compelling. I would like to ask about 
the timing. 
Would this have been an acquisition you would have made earlier, maybe a year ago, if it had been possible? Is 
there anything suggesting, maybe the recession, that indicated it was slower than you would have liked? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: The very candid answer is, we would probably not have been able to do this a year ago and 
there are several reasons. 
First, Cisco in the last year has got our decks cleared pretty successfully, and has really got these councils and 
Boards, the new organization structure, working with 30 different priorities. For example, Marthin and Tony 
owning our video architectural strategy. 
We're molding our Smart-connected cities. David Holland owning the sports and entertainment. You begin to go 
through each one of these and you see how they come together, which by the way, each of these plays are not 
silo'ed plays, they are architectured together. 
We also moved about $1 billion in resources into these new market adjacencies during this same time period. 
And without the quality of the products we both have, we would not have probably had the courage to go halfway 
around the world for this type of commitment into Norway. And now the way we use our products will actually 
allow us to do this very effectively. 
I was so proud of 5,700 meetings a week in TelePresence, until Fredrik said we do 96,000 a month. So I smile at 
that, but that really means we both have the common technology where you will be able to do this integration 
architecture at realized speed. So we probably would not have been either structurally nor quite ready to jump this 
far around the world a year ago. 
The recession actually doesn't have an effect for us. We tend to be very aggressive during market downturns, but 
we wanted to see the market start to give reasonable indications of an upturn before you start to move, because, 
boy, you don't want to bet into one that potentially, as many people projected in January/February, could be off a 
cliff. We didn't think that was going to happen, but we knew that it was a possibility. 
So the indirect answer to your question -- timing-wise, if we were right and we've been very public in our 
statements, and we think the odds are good we are coming out of this, and we saw that data on a global basis, it's 
too early to say how strong we come out of it, but that's the logical time that you move. 
And to the last part of your indirect question, are we going to be -- continue to be aggressive in internal 
development in acquisitions and strategic partnerships? Yes, we will. We will be the most aggressive you've 
probably seen us as a company. And with $35 billion in cash, now $32 billion (multiple speakers), and the $3 
billion that was used for this was the cash that was located outside the US -- which, again, I think our 
shareholders will be pleased with as well.

Page 108 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Did that answer the question, both your direct question and indirect question? 
DOMINIC DODD: Yes, yes. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: You know, I'm getting bad at reading your notes. I've got to do something (multiple 
speakers). That's how you can tell when you've been in the home office too long, when you can't read notes 
upside down quickly, when your partners or customers give you the chance. 
But it does speak to why, what? -- video is the way you're going to communicate in the future. And without video, 
you really can't have effective communications with partners and supply chains. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: We're going to go to Santa Fe now, to Jim Lindy from Gartner. 
Jim? 
JIM LUNDY, ANALYST, GARTNER, INC.: It's Jim Lundy with Gartner. John, you've certainly been using and 
talked about how much Cisco uses your high-end TelePresence systems, which is high-definition and obviously, 
for those on the call, that they're very high clarity. 
Since you now have how high-def video from the desktop to the boardroom, can you talk about maybe -- does 
this really potentially represent a new era, where we shift from a lot of audio and more from a B-2-B perspective 
too, an era of video communications? And can you talk about the ramifications for businesses, about that? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: It is, I think, the most important transition that is occurring. It doesn't matter if you're in 
healthcare or education, or how you support your customers, or how do you sell to your customers, or even how 
you fill out tax returns. Video is the primary way people communicate. And I think that now that you're beginning 
to make video that has the high quality with any device to any content with open interoperability, to almost any 
device, it will change business models with tremendous speed. 
This is why I feel so strongly about the definition of broadband to the home shouldn't be a [make or two]; it should 
be to 50 or 100. This is why I believe so strongly while consumers should have a right to access to general 
Internet capability, you've got to have -- however, the search providers have to have the capability to be able to 
guarantee a given response time, whether you're dealing with healthcare or you're dealing with entertainment that 
the users are willing to pay a premium for. 
So yes, I do think video is the killer application here. It's the heart of transforming this industry. And until video 
took off, collaboration was nice, but you didn't get the paybacks, you didn't get the excitement at the top, and you 
didn't get people willing to spend the money. 
We think this is a tipping point that would drive the industry. So I know you set me up with that question, but I 
completely agree with everything you implied. 
Now is there anything I missed in the way you asked it, and is there a second question behind it? 
JIM LUNDY: Well, I mean, for example, the traditional way that CEOs and CFOs have meetings is, people get on 
the plane and they go to headquarters. So the speed that you inferred there relative to the people that have 
bought your systems and the TANDBERG systems, for the people that don't have them, I think that there are 
some implications that maybe that the people that don't have them, don't understand yet. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Completely, again -- I'll answer it. You go first (multiple speakers). Go ahead. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, I was just going to say, you know, it's fascinating, we just 
the other day was talking about this -- because inside of Cisco, we do about 5,600 scheduled meetings a week. 2 
million Cisco employees participate per quarter in a TelePresence meeting. 
And often we will hear that people would realize that they are so advanced that the meeting they were thinking 
would be on TelePresence was actually scheduled as an audio conference, and they would cancel the meeting to 
make sure they get it on video. They would reschedule it. And that's what the IT person was telling me. 
So it's a fascinating trend that I think you are identifying in terms of, I do believe -- especially in the B-2-B side, 
we've all struggled through audio conferences with a partner or customer, where you can't read the body 
language and it's very hard to interpret, sometimes, what people are saying or what they are feeling. Whereas, 
with this medium, of course, you get a totally different experience and a much more high quality experience.

And I think now that the network is ready, the technology is ready, and high definition is broadly available, and we 
can make it interoperable amongst many systems, I think that shift will occur and it's going to be pervasive. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: John? Let me just do one more question from Fredrik's side. Go ahead. 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: No, that's quite all right. I actually do believe company standards now start adopting this 
technology will be of a competitive disadvantage. I think this will drive permanent productivity increases for the 
organization. 
And then using our own company as an example, as was pointed out, the 96,000 video calls a month across 
1,500 employees, we would not have been able to drive the type of operation we are at a global scale without 
video. And I think more and more companies will get to realize that. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: You know, what is interesting -- this is the only technology I've ever seen that CEOs sells 
other CEOs on. You can be sitting in a conference room with 100 CEOs at a Jack Welch conference or other 
events, and they talk about investing in technology as general discussions. 
Then one person mentioned TelePresence, then the other person mentioned TelePresence. Then they talk about 
how they use it for business, then they talk about how they're transferring their travel costs and they say new 
markets, et cetera. 
And once you get the high-end of the iceberg with people understanding the advantages, it goes right through the 
organization. So you're suddenly, instead of talking about how you go from 5 to 10, you're talking about how you 
go from 50 to 100 to 1,000, and as you fill in the product range. And it comes to what customers are doing, 
saying, we want to see this architecturally across the board. 
Now, somebody asked a question, you have to put two sentences before (multiple speakers) -- 
NED HOOPER: John, yes, John, this was Ned. I was going to just jump in. You made some comments earlier 
about some of the things we look for, for our acquisitions that make acquisitions successful, and how 
TANDBERG had fit across every one of those except for location. 
And I can tell you personally, I first visited TANDBERG back in 2003, from a corporate development perspective, 
we spent a lot of time, obviously, meeting with companies, understanding markets and how things are changing. 
And when I left Oslo in 2003, I said, you know, this is a really interesting market. So I don't think we can make a 
combination work between a company located in Oslo and a company located in the United States. 
And now, as we went through this, and the conversations internally at Cisco about whether we thought this was a 
good acquisition, actually, the availability of video communications is what changes us from being able to say no, 
that's not a place we can do something, to now we can. In fact, I think what you'll see with this acquisition is it will 
be a showcase for how you can use video to actually operate a business that is located across multiple sites in 
multiple countries, and increase actually our pace and capability of innovation, as a result. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: (multiple speakers) Go ahead. 
JIM LUNDY: No, I just want to follow up on that point. So whose TelePresence system is going to be in the clean 
room? 
NED HOOPER: Well, so, right now, we will continue to operate as separate companies, right? We're not going to 
establish a complete clean room in that sense; but we've been very successful, as we've put the transaction 
together, in using TANDBERG technologies to bridge the MCU, et cetera. And we'll connect pretty seamlessly 
during the interim period here before we put the deal together. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Great. Our next question comes from the sell side, Thomas 
Weisel Partners -- When can we expect the deal to be accretive for Cisco? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Fiscal year 2011. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. Great. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Now, that assumes a conservative business model. The challenge we'll give to Fredrik and 
to Marthin is, let's see if this truly is a tipping point, which can scale [out] quicker? But if you were playing with 
Cisco, normal conservatism, that's when it would occur.

Page 110 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay, great. We have another Web question from an investor. 
In order for companies to experience the true benefits of video conferencing, it seems as though top management 
must mandate that video be used instead of travel. In many instances, it seems like the video room is installed 
and never used, and therefore perceived as unproductive. 
How do you plan to address this issue and get top management onboard? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Two separate questions, even though it sounds like one. This is actually an easy CEO sale. 
You get in front of a CEO, you share with them the budgets that both of us do; you share with them the savings 
they lack in travel. 
You reference the JP Morgan Chase, who has 70 of them involved, where Jamie Diamond, the minute he buys a 
company, puts four or five of these TelePresence systems in place; you reference a GE that looks about how they 
share their professional resources in Europe and in the US, into the markets where 70% of the growth will come, 
which is emerging markets -- they can't be done without these technologies. 
You talk about new business models, and then all of a sudden with this combination, you talk about the ability 
down to a desktop or a handheld device, up to the boardroom with easy-to-use. Then you talk about media net 
being able to send it to communities of interest; and then all of a sudden, you take these concepts that many 
people had thought Cisco, you're five or six years ahead before I'll do it, to them saying, perhaps I need to 
reshape my organization next year, not further out. 
So this is truly the one technology sale that you can sell top-down easier than you can bottom-up. (multiple 
speakers) 
MARTHIN DE BEER: I also think that four or five years ago, video didn't really live up to its promise. But since 
then, a lot of technology has improved a lot. We have high definition, we have faster processors, we have much 
better audio. We have this kind of experience which really delivers. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: But you all have delivered an architectural system, not a videoconferencing. That would be 
like generation one. 
Videoconference rooms today are still used 2% to 3% of the time, and they have really actually slowed down our 
industry because people are thinking of the past rather than the future. 
You didn't have a common IP network that keeps voice in sync with data, with the capability. You didn't have the 
capability for advanced services to go and help not only the installation be successful, but to help to model a 
business model as you move forward. 
You didn't have a group like IBSG saying, here's how you do it, to change your aircraft engines business case. 
Here's how you do it to change in Home Depot, the capability in your kitchens. Here's how you do the experts 
visibly into the kitchen. You do have the capability to retail bank to do cross-selling and to balance into it. 
You didn't have the capability to deliver healthcare like we do at Cisco. Straight to our doctors on campus, so that 
if somebody gets sick, they don't leave -- which is great for productivity, and they get a healthier response 
quicker. 
So I think it's those changes in terms of it being much easier to use, more of an architecture to sell; but once you 
use it at the high-level, then you're much more likely to accept it in a more subtle format down at the desktop or 
on the phone or something like that. 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: And just one at addition to that comment is, this TelePresence room you're sitting in, 
think of it as a big phone on top of our unified communications system. And to use it is as simple as making a 
phone call or one button to push. 
As we integrate all of TANDBERG's endpoints with our unified communications, that simple, easy-to-use model 
will come to all of the endpoints in this complete portfolio. And that means that it becomes so simple to use that 
you don't have to train anyone in your organization to do it, and no one has to stand outside the door to make it 
work. 
And that really, I think, will be, at the end of the day, what will drive much more pervasive usage.

JOHN CHAMBERS: And as we said before, we'll bring this into the home in this next year, and you're going to 
see us very much on schedule to do that in multiple formats. So you'll be able to get any video from any device, 
any music from any device, split between your business and your others. And you see why we're playing this 
architecturally, not silo'ed products. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. Thank you. Our next question is from Lee Doyle in 
Boston. 
LEE DOYLE, ANALYST, IDC: John, you touched on one of my favorite topics, in terms of guaranteed bandwidth 
over the Internet to provide video services. I wanted to either expand a little bit -- does net neutrality debate sort 
of compromise the ability to deliver high quality video experience to the consumer? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I think the debate does not compromise at all. I think you've got to have a very healthy 
give-and-take. And I think Julius Genachowski from the FCC -- very smart guy; I've been very impressed with him 
-- he's out listening to the public, to the service providers, to the cable companies, et cetera, and also listening to 
the business and understanding the premise that need to be done from both sides. 
I think you can find a way to do an and here, not an or, and I think it's very important that people do not make a 
decision on a net neutrality and define it right, regardless of if you're in Europe or in the US, without saying, what 
do you want your infrastructure to look like five and 10 years out? 
If your definition is you want 100 megs to the home, your definition is you want, when you talk to your doctor, 
guaranteed bandwidth response, so you're able to see your charts, able to see the doctor when you say, how 
serious is this? And all of a sudden the voice breaks up. 
Your ability to be able to watch your games among families across areas to where the game is coming through, 
not like when it breaks up like from the satellite, et cetera. You've got to do something to find your end goal -- 
where do you want to be on the paradigm of in the top 20 countries in the world or do you want to be in the top 
five? 
Where do you want to be on the tech paradigm in terms of being able to really drive productivity at 2% or 3% a 
year from this broadband implementation with collaboration and video? 
So my view is you describe your vision first, then you describe your strategy to get there. Then, and only then, do 
you make your decision on net neutrality. President Clinton said it very well at the Clinton Global Initiative this last 
week. He said, government spends 80% of its time on what to do and how to pay for it, as opposed to how do you 
do it and what's the vision you want to be in? 
So I actually am probably the optimist here. While it might sounds like groups are arguing from opposite ends, I 
think Julius will listen well, and I think he really will come with a plan for the first time in the US, where a 
broadband plan is a basis for productivity and sustainable growth. And as you do that, you've got to have 
guaranteed response times and managed services capable. 
At the same time, the service providers are going to have to come some way and compromise, to say how do we 
provide a capability that allows the average citizen for areas that may not be near as critical, to get an approach? 
So maybe I am a little bit optimistic here; I hope not, but I think this will be a healthy give-and-take. But I think in 
the end, if it's done right, it will position the US to be really competitive long-term. And I think that's how the hand 
should play out in Europe countries as well as in China and other areas. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: While we're there in Boston, [Stuart] -- can we go to you? 
Stuart is a buy-sider with Eaton Vance. 
UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: A question for John and Fredrik. John, you mentioned that TelePresence will 
report into Fredrik and be run out of Oslo. So geographically, that seems to be challenging, so I'm wondering if 
you could talk about what specific actions will be taken to reduce the integration risk. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Okay, and it goes back to also setting up the question. We would not have tried this 12 to 24 
months ago. So, Marthin -- Fredrik is going to be reporting to you; let's talk about how we minimize the 
geographic risk. 
Because it is a fair question for the Cisco shareholder, saying, this is a risk that you've not done before. And we 
understand that clearly reflects in the premium that you're going to be -- and build that into the premium. But how

Page 112 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
do you then turn it around and say why this is going to be done very well, and why is it going to exceed our 70% 
hit rate of making acquisitions very successful? 
Talk about it from the human resources, technology, and your biggest concerns. And then, Fredrik, obviously, it's 
coming your way, since Marthin and I are going to turn to you and say, make it happen." 
MARTHIN DE BEER: Well, John, we've chat about this and I think Fredrik and I share absolutely a common 
vision on this. 
It comes down to three things. First of all, we have two teams that is incredibly passionate about video and using 
video. In fact, there are few phones on people's desks in TANDBERG as I walked around and looked at it. And, of 
course, the TelePresence team in San Jose is equally passionate. 
So we are going to use our own technology extensively to bring people face to face on a continued basis and 
across that geographic boundary. 
We will have video walls up and in engineering labs 24 hours a day, so people can walk by and talk to each other 
and interact. But more importantly, at a leadership level, we are going to relocate the two top TelePresence 
executives from San Jose here to Oslo and London for at least the first year, so Fredrik will have his entire 
leadership team in the same time zone to manage and do the integration successfully. And that I think is a very, 
very important step. 
And then thirdly, we are going to rotate engineers from Oslo and London to San Jose for three, six-month period, 
so they can keep doing the same job but doing out of the other location, building the relationships, sharing ideas. 
And we are going to rotate engineers out of Silicon Valley also to London and Oslo, similarly. 
So we think that through the combination of having the leadership in the same time zone, using the technology 
extensively -- and actually, there's a fourth one we spoke about, which is timeshifting some of the work hours in 
both locations so there's more overlap, especially for the first couple of years. 
Doing all those things with two teams very passionate about using this technology, we think this could be a model 
for how you successfully integrate in ways that hasn't been possible before. 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: I think that was very well-articulated, and I think you can tell also from Marthin's [asset] 
this has been one of the key discussions as we went through the planning for this. And it's been one of the things 
we wanted to make sure we had nailed down to people, responsibility and location. 
Again, I think what we found was cultures that were very similar. I think that's what makes us comfortable that at 
the R&D level, we can really get this done. 
We were talking about timeshifting; you would be surprised. We have teams today in the UK, Norway and India, 
and they will work at any hour. And the most productive hours are typically not the ones in the middle of the day; 
they will work at all hours from home offices and so forth. We're very used to working -- I mean, people just walk 
up to virtual video walls that are always on in India, and shoot questions to their colleagues in Norway and so 
forth. 
So we will definitely use our own technology and we will trust that we have people that have the same vision [and 
touch] that wants to drive for the same goal. And that's the feedback we're getting and that's what we'll architect 
for. 
MARTHIN DE BEER: And I would say both our teams are fully born into that at a leadership level. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: So, three things that you've heard that is dramatically different here. I'm going to go to the 
third one now. 
If the organization structure of Cisco had not changed over the last couple of years, from command to control to 
top-down, this would not work. You had to get these councils and Boards working with ability for Marthin to be 
able to reach across the whole Company and make this flow the right way. 
At the same time, we're are doing the datacenter, and at the same time, we're doing the consumer; at the same 
time, we're doing Smart-connected communities; at the same time, we're doing the implementation of sports and 
entertainment; at the same time, we're moving in the music industry; at the same time, we're going into Mexico 
with 3.0; at the same time, we're going into mobility architecture.

Page 113 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
So you're seeing the structure of the organization capable of supporting this, that only if this had made our one or 
two priority, we would have even tried this two years ago; where now, I don't have to do anything. This team 
presented to the Board with two weeks notice; has your team in place on how to do it, and the Board signed off 
very quickly. That would have normally taken me 6 to 12 months, two months of getting ready for the Board, et 
cetera. 
So speed, scale, replication and flexibility. It's amazing these organizations' structures, how it works. But they're 
built on what we're doing together at the collaborative platform. 
As you can tell, I'm excited about it, so just let me slow down my enthusiasm for a second and get to the next 
question. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Great, thank you. We're going to go back to [Bedfont]. We have 
a couple of questions there. David from Ovum. 
UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: You talked there about partnerships and you mentioned for your own and you 
talked about integration partners that you have. Could you tell us a little bit how you see presenting Cisco and 
TANDBERG options through service providers, particularly the large telcos that have been important partners for 
you? 
How, particularly at the high end of the business, what should they expect from you and are they dealing with 
Fredrik now exclusively? Or how is that going? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Well, first is that understand Cisco's view on service providers has aligned with service 
provider strategy from day one. We believe the service providers will be the vehicle to deliver much of the 
communications, data, cloud capabilities and functionality. And we invested almost 50% of our R&D budget for a 
decade to give that capability. 
We are equally interested with the network being intelligent, not just dumb pipes, because if that occurs, service 
providers don't provide much value. So architecturally, in terms of how we want the market to evolve, completely 
align with service providers. 
Secondly, in terms of the game play -- and there's been a huge transition in the last year, to where if you had 
asked for Randall Stephenson, how closely does Cisco align with your top business objectives? And how does 
that compare to two years ago? It is night and day. 
It was another service provider, which I won't say, who pushed me very hard, Ned, six months ago (multiple 
speakers), including holding up orders if I didn't move on it, but it was not subtle -- to move on it. So this, when 
you call a service provider -- and we called a number of the big ones already today -- there is not much of a 
discussion point about what we did or why we did it. 
The answer is -- good news; when can we do it? And so this is one that is a natural with the service providers. 
They were actually -- a half dozen of them were the driving accounts behind this, wanting us to get much closer 
together. So it isn't just about how do I build a TelePresence exchange for the high end? How do I bring it all the 
way to the desktop? How do I really get this well ahead of the market? And how do I begin to bring it to business 
models? 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: And I would say, as per our previous conversation, our channel 
partners as well, whether you talk about the TANDBERG channel partners or the Cisco channel partners, there 
has been a desire to provide a complete solution, desktop to boardroom. And none of them have had it; and with 
this combination, they will. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Yes. You all have to keep us balanced, but my view is -- I'm repeating the same point -- this 
is a market transition, a tipping point in the industry. I think it will accelerate the whole industry; both for us and, 
candidly, it will force our peers to move as well. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay, we're almost at time, so we have our last question, and 
we are going to stay in Bedfont and go to Angela Ashington from MWD Advisors. 
ANGELA ASHINGTON, ANALYST, MWD ADVISORS: It's actually a bit of a follow-on question, actually, it's the 
last one around partners. I see TANDBERG had a number of strategic partners -- sort of more coming from the 
software side of things -- so IBM, Microsoft, also HP, Avaya -- and how do you see those partnerships? Will they 
carry on going forward? How will they play out? Are they sort of something that you are still looking at to 
maintain?

Page 114 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: Well, certainly, I think this is a game of trying to expand the markets. And since this is a 
communication architecture we are trying to put in place, part of the rationale here is to really open up it up and 
make sure we get the multiplicator effects in place. 
So we love to sort of compete but we also like to collaborate, where that brings more success to the customers. 
So I think that will be our going-forward vision. 
JOHN CHAMBERS: I think it's important as the best interests of the industry to allow interoperability -- and use 
Microsoft as an example. We work with Microsoft in eight areas; we compete in two. In those two, we 
interoperate. It's in their interest and our interest to do that. And I think the industry will move much faster because 
of this open interoperability, open standards. 
And again repeating, this is part of the reason that we were comfortable in making the commitment that we did to 
TANDBERG in terms of the acquisition. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Fantastic. Closing remarks? Any final thoughts? 
JOHN CHAMBERS: Fredrik, I'm going to let you close this but I'm going to make a comment (multiple speakers). 
You know, I've been in this business for almost two decades. There has never been an area that I think had the 
capability to transform everything from standard of living to education, to healthcare, to business models to -- 
maybe for the first time, addressing the global challenge of 3 billion people making less than $3 a day, in a way 
that was sustainable, like collaboration and the power of the network as the platform for these change and 
innovation. 
And what we're seeing, with what might look like Star Trek today, we are doing things in emerging countries and 
learning in China and India very rapidly what to do and bring it straight back to Western Europe or the US with 
tremendous speed and efficiency. 
But was has always been missing was ease-of-use of getting systems to work together well, and what was really 
missing is the vast majority of communications interaction isn't one to one, and isn't voice or data; it's many to 
many, and it is with video. And that's really what this combination is about, and I think it gets people thinking a lot 
more out-of-box on what can occur. 
Fredrik, closing comments? 
FREDRIK HALVORSEN: Well, I'd just like to say that while we are -- we are proud of the legacy we have built. 
Our focus as a team and as a company has always been on the future. And as John pointed out, that is a $34 
billion market opportunity, everyone to everyone. 
We're very proud to be part of that journey. We think the time is right, now, to join forces. It will accelerate 
integration; it will expand the marketplace. And I think it will be a great proposition to both the people of Cisco and 
the people of TANDBERG. 
So I guess I'll just close by saying that we are fully behind this, and really look forward to getting it closed so we 
can get on with the business.

The networking giant intends to plug Tandberg's video-conferencing and network infrastructure products into its 
collaboration lineup 
Cisco has agreed to purchase Norwegian video-conferencing provider Tandberg for about $3bn, the companies 
announced on Thursday. 
Tandberg's video and network infrastructure products will be integrated into Cisco's collaboration architecture, 
subject to regulatory approval of the deal. A new TelePresence Technology Group will be created, headed by 
Fredrik Halvorsen, Tandberg's chief executive. 
Cisco and Tandberg have remarkably similar cultures and a shared vision to change the way the world works 
through collaboration and video-communications technologies, said Cisco chief executive John Chambers in a 
joint statement. Collaboration is a $34bn [21bn] market and is growing rapidly - enabled by networked Web 2.0 
technologies. 
As a result of the deal, Cisco will add to its lineup of collaboration products, according to the statement. 
Cisco will make a cash offerof 153.5 Norwegian Kroner (16.50)per share to acquire the Norwegian 
teleconferencing vendor, a premium of 11 percent on Tandberg's stock market closing price on Wednesday. The 
companies expect the purchase to close during the first half of 2010. 
Tandberg competitor Polycon said the deal shows the teleconferencing market is increasing. Today's news 
reinforces the growing interest in visual communication as a... business tool, said Steve Leyland, Polycom's 
EMEA managing director, in a statement. 
In July, Cisco announced its intention to move its WebEx unified-communications product to the cloud. The move 
followed Cisco's launch in 2006 of its Unified Communications system, which brings together voice, data, video 
and mobile communications.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- Cisco Systems Inc., the world 's largest networking equipment maker, 
announced on Thursday that it has agreed to buy Norwegian videoconferencing company Tandberg ASA for 
about 3 billion U.S. dollars in cash, a move aimed to expand its products portfolio. 
Cisco said it will buy all the outstanding shares of Tandberg for 153.5 Norwegian Kroners (about 26.4 U.S. 
dollars) per share, an 11-percent premium to the previous day closing price of Tandberg's stocks. 
According to information posted on Tandberg's website, the company has more than 1,500 employees worldwide 
and has dual headquarters in Norway's Oslo and New York, the United States. 
Calling itself the market share leader in the videoconferencing industry, Tandberg said it holds "the highest 
market share for video infrastructure products as well as video endpoints, whether measured in terms of revenue 
or unit volume." 
"Cisco and Tandberg have remarkably similar cultures and a shared vision to change the way the world works 
through collaboration and video communications technologies," John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive officer, 
said in a statement. 
"This acquisition showcases Cisco's financial strength and ability to quickly capture key market transitions for 
growth," he added.

Cisco Offers 3 Billion For Tandberg in Enterprise Video Play

Cisco Offers 3 Billion For Tandberg in Enterprise Video Play

Cisco Oct. 1 agreed to acquire video conferencing rival Tandberg for $3 billion in cash, the latest move in the 
networking giant's hungry push in the collaboration market. 
The bid is an 11 percent premium over the Sept. 30 closing price of Tandberg's stock, and a 25 percent premium 
over the three-month average closing price for the Norwegian company. The premium purchase in a relatively 
lackluster economy underscores the importance Cisco places on video for enterprises. 
Tandberg is a leading maker of "video endpoints and network infrastructure," or computer servers and software 
that help large businesses shuttle video to their employees over the Internet. Cisco is also a major provider in this 
space, focusing on telepresence, which allows employees to conduct face-to-face meetings through computer 
and television screens, leveraging video carried over the Web. 
Enterprise executives use technology from Tandberg and Cisco to broadcast live messages to thousands of 
employees. Corporate employees use solutions from these vendors to hold video conference meetings with 
colleagues located worldwide in remote offices. 
While Cisco sells its video conferencing technology to larger businesses, Tandberg also offers gear to 
medium-sized businesses and makes software for managing video conferencing systems. 
Cisco Chairman and CEO John Chambers said on a conference call today that Tandberg does an "amazing job" 
selling to these mid-level businesses and delivering video to desktops. 
"When we began to look at this combination, we saw an opportunity to hit a tipping point in the collaboration 
market," Chambers said, noting that Tandberg marks Cisco's first bid for a publicly traded company outside the 
United States. 
Yankee Group analyst Zeus Kerravala said he was surprised Cisco had not bid for Tandberg sooner, noting that 
Cisco's current telepresence software is not meant for ad hoc communications. With Tandberg, Cisco will be able 
to satisfy the larger corporate video market. 
Cisco believes enterprise video tools are a cornerstone of the $34 billion collaboration technology market. 
The company started this march in 2006, when it acquired IP TV provider Scientific Atlanta for $6.9 billion, and 
then went on to acquire Web conferencing specialist WebEx for $2.9 billion in 2007. Cisco this year also bought 
Pure Digital, maker of the popular Flip handheld video recording device. 
In buying Tandberg, Cisco is removing a rival and strengthening its own video infrastructure offerings. 
Cisco expects to complete the acquisition, recommended unanimously by Tandberg's directors, during the first 
half of 2010. Should the deal close, Cisco will integrate Tandberg's technology into its own telepresence portfolio. 
Tandberg CEO Fredrik Halvorsen will lead the new TelePresence Technology Group, reporting to Marthin De 
Beer, senior vice president of Cisco's Emerging Technologies Group. 
Cisco did not specify how many Tandberg employees it would retain, saying only in a statement that the 
company's 1,500 employees "will be extremely important as Cisco's team continues to drive video innovation and 
growth."

LONDON/OSLO (Reuters) - Cisco has agreed to buy Norwegian videoconferencing company Tandberg for $3 
billion in cash, its latest big bet that video will drive demand for its core data transmission gear. 
The acquisition will fill the wide gap between Cisco's high-end TelePresence video meeting service for executives 
and its WebEx tool used by millions of office workers for online meetings, and could bring videoconferencing to a 
mass market. 
Tandberg's board has recommended the Cisco offer to its shareholders and Chief Executive Fredrik Halvorsen 
told investors that major shareholders had voiced support for the offer of 153.50 Norwegian crowns ($26.49) a 
share. 
Halvorsen will continue to lead the unit if the acquisition goes through. 
Shares in Tandberg, which had almost doubled in value this year by persistent takeover speculation, were 11 
percent higher at the offer price of 153.5 crowns by 1348 GMT on Thursday, having traded at up to 156 crowns 
earlier in the day. 
Cisco's shares were little changed in early U.S. trade, at $23.56. 
In October 2008 Tandberg ended takeover talks with an unnamed private equity player, blaming market turmoil. 
A person familiar with the matter said the bidder was technology specialist Silver Lake Partners. 
"This (the Cisco offer) sounds like a pretty good price so I would think it will end up there," said analyst Martin 
Hoff of Arctic Securities. "But the bid will stand for four weeks and there might be other (offers)." 
Potential rival suitors include Hewlett-Packard, which is also active in Web collaboration. The market has also 
linked telecoms gear maker Ericsson with Tandberg. 
DnB NOR Markets named in a report on Thursday Juniper, IBM, Sony and Siemens. 
The offer values Tandberg at about 23 times 2010 earnings, analysts say, slightly above U.S. rival Polycom's 
multiple of 21.7. 
MORE AGGRESSIVE 
The acquisition, if approved by shareholders and regulators, will be Cisco's biggest deal since the world's top 
maker of internet routers and switches bought WebEx for $3.2 billion in 2007. 
Chief Executive John Chambers said Cisco, which had a cash pile of $35 billion as of July 25, would step up the 
pace. 
"You're going to see us more aggressive over the next 12 months than you have seen us as a company," he told 
a news conference in Oslo. "We will be very aggressive with internal start-ups, partnering ... and also in 
acquisitions."

Page 122 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Technology merger activity is picking up as the market improves, and borders between sub-sectors are breaking 
down. 
PC maker Dell recently bought IT services firm Perot Systems, and software maker Oracle bought hardware firm 
Sun. 
Cisco said it hopes to close the deal in the first half of 2010, subject to regulatory approval. The acquisition would 
give the company a broad portfolio that rivals would struggle to match, although one anti-trust lawyer said he saw 
few issues. 
"There doesn't seem to be any significant overlap in the companies' operations on the basis of the limited 
information we have available," said Morten Nissen at Brussels law firm Bird & Bird. "I don't see any major 
problems that can't be handled." 
JP Morgan is advising Tandberg and Lazard is advising Cisco. 
NETWORK TRAFFIC 
Cisco says it can bring its network expertise to bear to make videoconferencing-a tool it considers underused due 
to the difficulty of the technology-a far smoother experience, and improve its popularity. 
"Cisco's be-all and end-all is network traffic," Nomura analyst Richard Windsor said. "The idea is that if you 
improve the user experience for office workers, you improve the overall demand for traffic." 
Tandberg also has its own 'telepresence' offering, designed gives the impression of conference participants being 
in the same room, which it launched earlier this year. 
It is the first that can connect to systems of rivals including those of Polycom and Microsoft, removing the need for 
companies to buy whole systems from those providers. 
Tandberg sells about 15,000-16,000 of its regular videoconferencing units every quarter for about $7,500 each, 
while Cisco has sold fewer than 10,000 in total of its TelePresence systems, which cost about $250,000. 
Cisco estimates the total value of collaboration tools, including everything from videoconferencing to conference 
calls to Google Apps, to be worth about $34 billion. 
The market could also receive a boost from the recession, which has slashed corporate travel budgets that are 
not expected to be completely restored when the economy recovers. 
Cisco says it has reduced its own global travel expenditure to about $260 million from $720 million, thanks to its 
investment in TelePresence as well as cuts it would have made.

Cisco has announced its intention to acquire video conferencing and communication vendor, Tandberg. 
According to a press statement, Cisco has commenced a cash tender off to purchase all company shares for 
approximately $US3 billion. The proposal has been unanimously recommended by Tandbergâs board of 
directors. Norway-based Tandberg is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and has 1500 employees worldwide. 
The acquisition is expected to close during the first half of next year but is subject to closing conditions as well as 
regulatory reviews in the US and elsewhere. 
"Cisco and Tandberg have remarkably similar cultures and a shared vision to change the way the world works 
through collaboration and video communications technologies," Cisco chairman and CEO, John Chambers, said 
in a statement. "Collaboration is a $US34 billion market and is growing rapidly â enabled by networked Web 2.0 
technologies. 
This acquisition showcases Cisco's financial strength and ability to quickly capture key market transitions for 
growth." Cisco said it planned to integrate Tandbergâs video endpoints and network infrastructure solution into 
its collaboration architecture. âoeThis will enable intercompany and multi-vendor interoperability and ease of use 
across the full product portfolio â from desktop to immersive, multi-screen TelePresence. This interoperability 
will benefit Cisco's customers, but also competitors and partners by accelerating customer interest in video 
collaboration globally,â

By Ben Worthen 
Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) has agreed to buy Norway-based Tandberg ASA (TAA.OS) for about $3 billion, 
expanding its push into so-called collaboration technologies that help people work together from different 
locations. 
The deal, announced early Thursday, is an all-cash tender offer that Cisco characterized as an 11% premium to 
Tandberg's closing price Wednesday, and 25.2% higher than a three-month average price for the stock. 
"It's a very smart deal at a good price," said Jeff Donlon, managing director at Manning & Napier, which owns 
shares in Cisco. The premium is considered low given the strategic importance to the company, industry 
observers say. 
Cisco's stock was recently 1.4% lower at $23.23. Tandberg shares were up 11% at NOK153.60. 
(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) 
Cisco, best known for making routers, switches and other gear that transmit data between computers, has 
recently expanded into 30 new businesses that it says can each produce $1 billion in revenue. One that the 
company consistently hails as the most promising is telepresence, video-conferencing systems that use large 
high-definition televisions to create a life-like effect. 
The San Jose, Calif., company has called telepresence its fastest growing product line ever, although it hasn't 
disclosed revenue for the business. 
Tandberg, which reported revenue of $809 million in 2008, makes a range of video-conferencing products, 
including high-end systems that compete with Cisco's and software that run on a computer. Cisco Chief Executive 
John Chambers said the deal will add to earnings in fiscal 2011. 
The acquisition "instantly expands our portfolio of high-end video products to go from the desktop to the 
boardroom," said Ned Hooper, Cisco's chief strategy officer. 
TandbergChief Executive Fredrik Halvorsen: "Cisco's ownership will strengthen Tandberg's position to serve our 
customers and partners with even greater innovation, and to expand opportunities for our employees." 
High-end telepresence is still a small market, with worldwide sales of the big, multi-screen systems in which Cisco 
specializes still less than $500 million a year, according to an estimate by Wainhouse Research. But it's one of 
the few technologies that has benefited from the recession, growing 30% from last year as businesses look to 
reduce travel expenses. 
Hooper said that acquiring Tandberg will not only help Cisco expand its offerings for telepresence but for 
collaboration technologies more generally, which he estimates is a market that generates $34 billion in annual 
revenue.

Page 134 of 139 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Cisco's goal, Hooper said, is to make video a key part of communication for small businesses as well as large 
ones, and eventually for consumers. Cisco benefits from increased video traffic because it drives demand for its 
core networking gear. 
Tandberg's products flesh out Cisco's teleconference offerings, allowing the networking titan to offer more 
products to large businesses, as well as lower-end offerings to small- and medium-sized businesses. 
"It's a one-stop shop for enterprise customers," Donlon said. "This is going to give Cisco a broader price point to 
sell." 
Chambers added he doesn't see merger cost savings from the deal and plans to invest in Tandberg. The 
company will move its telepresence business under Tandberg CEO Halvorsen. 
"Fredrik has almost an unlimited blank check," Chambers quipped. "This isn't a matter of synergies or cutting 
costs." 
Other companies that sell telepresence systems include Polycom Inc., LifeSize Communications Inc. and 
Hewlett-Packard Co. H-P also resells some Tandberg video systems. 
Radvision Ltd. (RVSN), which currently provides teleconferencing equipment to Cisco, is seen taking a hit since a 
third of its revenue comes from the tech bellwether. Shares fell 31% to $6.10. 
Cisco, which reported revenue of $36.1 billion in the fiscal year ending in July, has $35 billion in cash, but $29 
billion is overseas and can't be spent in the U.S. without a large tax penalty. The deal for Tandberg was made 
with its overseas reserves, said Hooper. Because of its global presence, Cisco generates much of its cash from 
overseas operations. 
Cisco has vowed to use its cash to grow while rivals struggle in the recession. "You'll see us be the most 
aggressive this year and next year that we've ever been in the history of our company," Cisco Chief Executive 
John Chambers said in a recent interview. 
Cisco said it will launch a tender offer, which Tandberg's board recommended unanimously. The offer could still 
be topped by a rival bid. Cisco said it expects the deal to close in the first half of calendar year 2010.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) Chief Executive John Chambers said he expects the 
acquisition of Tandberg ASA (TAA.OS) to add to Cisco's earnings in fiscal 2011. 
That target could change and speed up, depending on how quickly Tandberg is integrated with Cisco and 
whether there is an increase in adoption of video conferencing services, Chambers said during a conference call 
Thursday. 
Chambers added that he doesn't see merger cost savings from the deal, and that Cisco plans to invest in 
Tandberg. Cisco will move its telepresence business under TandbergCEO Fredrik Halvorsen, he added. 
"Fredrik has almost an unlimited blank check," Chambers quipped. "This isn't a matter of synergies or cutting 
costs." 
Chambers said Cisco plans to continue to be aggressive with future deals. 
Halvorsen, meanwhile, said Cisco and Tandberg share a similar corporate culture and vision of the use of video 
by businesses down the line. He also praised Cisco's ability to accelerate developments.

Cisco Lifts Video Conferencing To Mass Mkt With Tandberg Buy 
Cisco Lifts Video Conferencing To Mass Mkt With Tandberg Buy

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Cisco Systems Inc.'s (CSCO) acquisition of Tandberg ASA (TAA.OS) clears the 
picture on how the networking titan plans to drive mass adoption of its video-conferencing products. 
High-end video conference, what Cisco has dubbed "telepresence," has been a pet project of Chief Executive 
John Chambers, who has called it the company's fastest-growing emerging area. Yet despite the hype, it 
remains a niche product with a hefty price tag. 
Coupling Cisco's marketing reach with Tandberg's ability to integrate different systems - whether they be a costly 
three-panel high-definition meeting room or a simple desktop program with Web cam - across multiple vendors 
could make video conferencing more attractive to business customers and, eventually, to consumers. 
"It won't just accelerate our business, but it will accelerate our peers and competitors' business," Chambers said 
during a Web cast conference call. "Interoperability will change the business models with tremendous speeds." 
Market adoption of video conferencing has long been stalled by twitchy technology that only recently has 
improved as well as the overall lack of scale. One company or individual isn't going to make a video call if no one 
else can receive it. 
Only 9% of U.S. workers who regularly work on a computer use video conferencing, and only 1% use it on a daily 
basis, according to Forrester Research. 
But there is a growing need for video conferencing with companies looking to cut their travel budgets and shy 
away from face-to-face meetings. 
"Unlike other recoveries, you likely won't see a bounce-back for air travel," said Jeff Donlon, managing director for 
Manning & Napier, which owns shares in Cisco. 
Cisco itself has cut its travel expense run rate to $240 million from $750 million a year ago, thanks to its almost 
religious use of telepresence rooms. The company doesn't break out the financials on its telepresence business. 
Following the merger's completion, expected in the first half of next year, the companies expect to make their 
products work together with all vendors, not just the Tandberg and Cisco systems. The process could take as 
little as a few months, said Martin De Beer, who runs Cisco's emerging technologies group. 
That ability to work with multiple systems increases the number of video conferencing systems that can work 
together, encouraging further adoption. With Tandberg's technology, companies using Cisco's high-end 
telepresence system can communicate with a person sitting in front of a laptop. 
"Video requires a network effect; you need a lot of people," said Ted Schadler, an analyst at Forrester Research. 
While Tandberg competes against Cisco in the high-end video system, the company also sells a number of 
lower-end conferencing systems that are more palatable to small and medium-sized businesses. 
The primary beneficiaries of the merger will be smaller businesses, Chambers said.

Ultimately, this technology could help drive adoption in the home. Last November, Chambers said he expected a 
consumer telepresence product to hit the home in the next 12 to 15 months. While the prediction may prove to be 
too aggressive, the Tandberg acquisition could bring his vision closer to reality. 
Cisco will push telepresence and video conferencing hard. Chambers said Tandberg CEO Fredrick Halvorsen will 
get "almost an unlimited blank check" to develop and integrate the products.

Cisco Systems continued on the acquisitions path Thursday as it announced a plan to acquire videoconferencing 
company Tandberg for $3 billion. 
The acquisition is a major building block in Cisco chairman and CEO John Chambers' pledge several months 
ago to broaden the firm's focus from routers and switches and expand into other areas, and particularly video. 
The Tandberg technology will complement Cisco's telepresence videoconferencing service and Cisco's online 
WebEx technology. 
"Cisco and Tandberg have remarkably similar cultures and a shared vision to change the way the world works 
through collaboration and video communications technologies," said Chambers in a statement. "Collaboration is a 
$34 billion market and is growing rapidly -- enabled by networked Web 2.0 technologies." 
Tandberg's chief executive Fredrik Halvorsen will lead Cisco's new telepresence technology group, reporting to 
Marthin De Beer, senior VP of Cisco's emerging technologies group. Long headquartered in Norway, Tandberg 
has about 1,500 employees. The $3 billion cash price represents an 11% premium over the closing price of 
Tandberg stock on Wednesday. 
Cisco said Tandberg's technology will be integrated into Cisco's existing collaboration architecture and will offer 
multi-vendor interoperability from desktop through multi-screen telepresence solutions. 
Tandberg's board of directors has unanimously recommended the deal to its shareholders, in a move that will 
likely discourage other companies from starting a bidding battle for the Norwegian company. 
Just days ago Chambers noted in an interview that Cisco's cash war chest of $35 billion -- the largest in the IT 
industry -- will be used for acquisitions. And, it was 18 months ago at a Las Vegas show that Chambers served 
notice that Cisco planned to aggressively broaden its product mix. "Video," he said at the time, "is the next wave 
of Internet disruption." 
Cisco has always made acquisitions, but its more recent pickups have been away from its traditional router/switch 
core business. Earlier this year Cisco acquired Pure Digital Technologies for $590 million, thereby gaining a big 
new presence in the consumer business with Pure Digital's popular Flip digital camcorder. 
In March, Cisco startled the IT industry -- and its traditional allies HP and IBM -- by announcing a line of blade 
servers as it set its sights on data centers. In announcing its move into data centers, Cisco also unveiled a strong 
group of partners including BMC Software, Citrix Systems, EMC, Intel, Microsoft, SAP, and VMware.
