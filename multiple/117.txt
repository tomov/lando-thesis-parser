HOUSTON, July 25 (Reuter) - The planned acquisition of an Oregon utility has Enron Corp executives charged 
up for the upcoming shake-up in the domestic electric industry. 
With its $2.1 billion bid for Portland General Corp, Enron became what it considers a crucial "first mover" in 
putting together its national electric franchise. 
Over the next two years, Enron executives expect the major players in the non-regulated wholesale electric 
market to position themselves to compete in the emerging national retail industry or move to the sidelines. 
"If you are not a major player, if you don't have the overall size and scope, well, you probably won't ever be a 
major player," Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said. 
Enron's merger with Portland General combines two companies with nearly identical philosophies for competing 
in a deregulated electric industry, the chairmen of the two companies said in a meeting with reporters on 
Wednesday. 
Portland General for the past several years has been paring its generating base because of overcapacity in the 
industry and building its competitive position in wholesale marketing. 
"The folks in our industry who continue to build (generating capacity) and add to rate base just are not playing 
with reality," Portland General Chairman Ken Harrison said. 
At the same time, Enron has been bulking up its electric and natural gas trading arm and converting its blueprint 
for trading gas to the newly opened electric wholesale markets. 
Enron and Portland General plan to position their combined company as the nation's dominant seller of 
electricity and natural gas in a domestic market valued at $268 billion. 
"We mutually see a strong convergence of gas and electric," Lay said. "We're just looking at Btu's." 
Shareholders of both companies are expected to vote on the merger in early October, but state and federal 
regulatory approvals could take up to a year. 
In addition to the Portland General merger, Enron has an agreement with the Tennessee Valley Authority, is 
competing to operate the Oglethorpe power cooperative in Georgia and is vying for assets of a bankrupt 
Louisiana utility. 
"The only missing pieces on this map that has to be handled is the Northeast," Lay said. 
That gap will be filled eventually with alliances and joint ventures instead of another utility merger that would 
saddle the company with power-generation assets, he said. 
"About the last thing you want in a world where we're going to have surplus generation for a long time is surplus 
generating assets," Lay said.

ENRON, the US gas company with significant interests in the UK, is merging with a US utility to create the largest 
integrated gas and electricity company in North America. 
The $12.5bn merger with Portland General, the Oregon electricity utility which depends on regulatory approval 
will fuse Enron's marketing operations with Portland's power supply. 
Ken Harrison, Portland chairman and chief executive, said the merger, to be executed in a stock-for-stock deal, 
is a response to the converging gas and electricity markets in the US. He said: "This merger is about positioning 
our companies for competition in an open market, not cost-cutting." 
Portland shareholders will receive one share of Enron common stock for each of their Portland common stock 
while Enron is to consolidate Portland's debt of about $1.1bn. 
Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive, giving a further reason for the merger, said: "The 
deregulation of the electricity market in North America represents one of the most significant industry 
restructurings ever." 
Portland's management structure is to remain while Mr Harrison will also become vice-chairman of the combined 
group. Enron, based in Texas, is a joint owner and operator of the Teesside power station and markets gas to UK 
industrial customers.

Enron, the Houston-based company which has been at the forefront of reshaping the natural gas industry in the 
US, yesterday acquired Portland General, an electricity producer and distributor based in Portland, Oregon. 
The move marks the company's attempt to play a leading role in the deregulation of the country's electricity 
industry. 
Enron's shares dropped 5% yesterday morning on fears over the impact the acquisition would have on its 
earnings, putting the value of the all-stock transaction at just over $2bn. The natural gas company will also 
assume $1.1bn of Portland's debt. Enron's shares were trading at $39 7/8, down about $2, while Portland's 
jumped $6 5/8 to $34 3/4. 
Mr Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, said the deal would "reshape the future of both the natural gas and electric 
utility industries" in the US. 
Until now, combinations of electricity companies in the US have typically involved mergers of neighbouring 
generators, which have seen benefits in combining overlapping activities and reducing costs. Yesterday's 
announcement, however, brings a brash and aggressive upstart into one of the last and most staid of the big 
regulated US utility industries. 
Enron, having taken advantage of the opening-up of the US natural gas market over the past 10 years to 
assemble a nationwide pipeline system, claims 17% of the country's $30bn wholesale natural gas distribution 
business, making it the largest such company in the industry. 
It is also a big wholesale marketer of electricity, and said the acquisition would make it the country's largest seller 
of electricity to big customers, after the Tennessee Valley Authority. 
Besides its natural home in the wholesale market, which involves sales to large, mainly corporate buyers, Enron 
also set its sights for the first time on sales of both electricity and natural gas to retail customers. Mr Lay said 
Enron aimed to become the biggest marketer in the US electricity business, which is worth $270bn a year. 
To achieve that, however, it will have to develop a national retail brand, which will involve skills the company has 
yet to develop. The acquisition of Portland will for the first time bring it retailing, billing and meter-reading 
activities. 
The deal will require regulatory approval that could take a year or more to obtain, the two companies said. 
Current regulations prevent Enron from making other big acquisitions in the electricity business. Mr Lay said the 
company hoped to expand its reach through marketing and other agreements.

The merger between Enron and Portland General is a further sign of the growing global convergence of the 
natural gas and electrical power industries. 
"This proposed merger with Portland General represents an outstanding opportunity for us to create the leading 
energy company of the future in the North American energy markets," said Mr Kenneth Lay, chairman and chief 
executive officer of Enron. 
The Enron/Portland link-up makes particular sense in a mature economy where deregulation is reshaping 
markets, say analysts. They note that British Gas, Enron's arch-rival in international markets, is also keen to 
expand into electricity as its domestic gas and electricity markets move to full liberalisation in 1998. 
However, the attraction of combining the two industries is also evident in emerging economies, where the use of 
natural gas as a fuel for combined cycle gas turbines is increasingly seen as the quickest and most viable way of 
meeting power shortages. 
Enron, whose roots are in the Texas natural gas business, has long embraced the notion of all-round energy 
provision, in contrast to many of the traditional oil majors which have shied away from extending themselves too 
far into electricity markets. 
The consolidation of the US natural gas industry has been moving quickly this year, with El Paso Energy's 
planned $4bn acquisition of Tenneco Energy the latest deal. Coming soon after deals linking Mobil with 
PanEnergy, and Chevron with Natural Gas Clearinghouse (in which British Gas has a substantial stake), the 
takeover will transform two regional businesses into a single national pipeline and marketing group. 
Enron executives use the term "visionary" to describe the company. Such claims evoke strong emotions among 
its competitors in the inter-national oil and gas industry, in part because Enron executives can pursue natural gas 
supply and power deals with near-religious zeal. 
The company's reputation as a sharp reader of industry trends suffered recently when it signed a contract for 
high-price gas in the UK just months before the wholesale gas market collapsed. 
Enron recently asked a US judge to nullify the large gas purchasing contract it has with North Sea producers. But 
the High Court in London ruled that the complex dispute between Enron and companies involved in the J-Block 
gas field and the Central Area Transmission System (Cats) pipeline must be heard in the UK.

HOUSTON, July 22 (Reuter) - Enron Corp. plans to acquire Portland General Corp. in a $2.1 billion stock 
transaction expected to accelerate deregulation of the electric industry, company executives said Monday. 
The deal is a milestone for Houston-based Enron, which has become the nation's largest power wholesaler and 
is striving to build one of the country's first nationwide electric companies. 
"This transaction reflects what we think is the future for energy in this country," Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay 
said of the merger, which includes a $1.1 billion assumption of debt from the Portland, Ore., utility. 
"With the convergence of the natural gas and electric markets, we believe this transaction will also accelerate the 
deregulation of electricity markets to drive down costs and, of course, increase competition," Lay said. 
Following the merger, the combined companies will control more than 5,900 megawatts of electric generating 
capacity worldwide and more than 37,000 miles of natural gas pipeline. 
"Combined, the two companies will now be the seventh largest seller of electricity in the U.S. and it is our goal to 
become the largest marketer of both electricity and natural gas in the future," Lay said. 
Strategically, Enron will gain a firm foothold in the West Coast electricity market and much-needed experience in 
serving retail electric customers in the deal, analysts said. 
Portland General controls 25 percent of the transmission capacity at the California-Oregon border where electric 
futures trade, and serves more than 657,000 retail electricity customers in northwest Oregon along with wholesale 
customers throughout the western United States. 
"This gives Enron the flexibility to wheel electrons everywhere west of the Rockies," PaineWebber analyst Ron 
Barone said. "The merger will also provide Enron with expertise in operating distribution wires." 
Portland General is considered a low-cost utility, buying about 87 percent of the power moving on its grid this 
year. The company operates relatively cheap hydroelectric, gas and coal plants after recently decommissioning 
its nuclear unit. 
"Our view is as the industry deregulates, the value of generating assets is going to go down," Enron Capital and 
Trade Resources Chairman Jeffrey Skilling said. 
Enron, a one-time gas pipeline company that has mushroomed into a giant international power producer and 
energy trader, does not plan to build up its national franchise by acquiring additional utilities across the country, 
Lay said. 
"Enron does not have a strategy of buying up utility assets," Lay said. "We are not intending to become a major 
holder of utility-type assets." 
Instead, it plans to pursue joint ventures and acquire assets to position itself in the emerging $270 billion U.S. 
retail market for electricity and natural gas, similar to the way long-distance telephone companies built up their 
national franchises.

"Our vision is this market is likely to evolve in a way that is not too dissimilar from the way the phone systems 
have evolved, where you as a household have the ability to call up Enron and purchase your gas and electricity," 
Enron Executive Vice President Ed Segner said. 
Enron will issue about 51 million new common shares to Portland General shareholders in the deal, which was 
approved by the boards of both companies Saturday and requires the approval of shareholders and regulators. 
Following the merger, the combined companies will have an equity value of about $12.5 billion, based on Enron's 
closing stock price of $41.75 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Portland General shares surged $6.75 to $34.875 while Enron shares dipped $2 to $39.75 in consolidated New 
York Stock Exchange trading.
