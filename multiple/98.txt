Pfizer Inc., the world's biggest drugmaker, may pay Incyte Corp. as much as $803 million for rights to 
experimental medicines against diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. Incyte shares rose as much as 39 
percent. 
Pfizer is buying the worldwide development and marketing rights to Incyte's portfolio of CCR2 antagonist 
compounds, the companies said in a statement Monday. Incyte will receive $40 million now and will be eligible for 
additional payments of as much as $743 million as well as royalties on drug sales. 
Pfizer is looking for new drugs to help increase sales as it loses patent protection on five more medicines through 
2010, including Lipitor for cholesterol, which had 2004 revenue of $10.9 billion. Earlier this year, Pfizer bought 
Vicuron Pharmaceuticals for $1.9 billion to gain an antibiotic and a fungal treatment and agreed to pay Coley 
Pharmaceutical Group Inc. as much as $505 million for a cancer drug. 
"Pfizer clearly is focused on bolstering its pipeline over the longer term," said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey 
analyst Bert Hazlett, who rates the stock "buy" and doesn't hold any shares, in a telephone interview Monday. 
"This transaction is a further step in our strategy to augment Pfizer's internal research and development efforts 
with high- potential, externally sourced product candidates and technologies," said Martin Mackay, Pfizer's senior 
vice president of worldwide research and technology, in the statement. 
Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Hank McKinnell is cutting $4 billion from annual costs by 2008. The company's 
sales have been hurt after the company's Celebrex pain drug was linked to heart risk and the patent expired on 
the Neurontin epilepsy medication. 
The most-advanced drug in Wilmington, Del.-based Incyte's portfolio of CCR2 antagonists is in the second of the 
three stages of testing generally required before regulators will consider approving a medicine. The treatment is 
being tested for use in rheumatoid arthritis and in insulin-resistant obese patients, Pfizer said. 
"This is a very important event for us and we believe a very positive development for our CCR2 program," Incyte 
Chief Executive Officer Paul Friedman said in a conference call with investors. "We're now in a much stronger 
position to advance our own growing pipeline." 
Drugs being developed include treatments for HIV, diabetes and cancer, Friedman said. 
Pfizer said it will get rights to a "full scope of potential indications" except for multiple sclerosis and one other 
undisclosed indication. Friedman declined on the conference call to name the indication. The CCR2 receptor has 
a central role in "inflammatory processes," Pfizer said. 
Pfizer said it will also buy $20 million in convertible notes from Incyte under the agreement.

(c) Copyright 2005 Medical Letter on the CDC & FDA via NewsRx.com 
2005 JUL 24 - (NewsRx.com) -- Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (MICU, Nuovo Mercato) 
announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby Pfizer will acquire Vicuron, a 
biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel anti-infectives for both hospital-based and 
community-acquired infections. 
Under the merger agreement, Pfizer will acquire all outstanding shares of Vicuron common stock at a price of 
$29.10 per share in cash, for an aggregate equity purchase price of approximately $1.9 billion. This price 
represents a 74% premium over Vicuron's 90-day average closing share price and a 21% premium over 
Vicuron's highest historical closing price of $24.10. 
Vicuron has two products currently under new drug application (NDA) review at the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA): anidulafungin for fungal infections and dalbavancin for Gram-positive infections. 
Recently, Vicuron announced positive phase III results on anidulafungin, demonstrating superiority versus 
fluconazole in invasive candidiasis/candidemia. Anidulafungin's potential product profile will include broad 
spectrum activity against aspergillus and most candidal fungal infections. It is anticipated the product will be 
indicated for once-daily dosing for up to a month. 
Dalbavancin has shown positive results in phase III studies in complicated skin and soft tissue infections and in a 
phase II study in catheter-related bloodstream infections. The product has once-weekly dosing. Vicuron recently 
announced it has received a 3-month extension to the priority review for the dalbavancin NDA. 
"By acquiring Vicuron, we can help bring two very important new medicines to patients around the world," said 
Hank McKinnell, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer. 
"This transaction builds on Pfizer's extensive experience in anti-infectives and demonstrates our commitment to 
strengthen and broaden our pharmaceutical business through strategic product acquisitions," added McKinnell. 
Pfizer already has an existing collaboration with Vicuron that has made significant advances in the discovery of 
potential next-generation oxazolidinones, the first new class of antibiotics in more than 30 years. These orally 
active antibiotics are targeting to have improved potency and a broader spectrum of activity than existing classes 
of compounds. Several Vicuron compounds are currently being evaluated at Pfizer as potential clinical 
development candidates. 
"We believe this transaction is in the best interests of our shareholders and will enable Vicuron's two near-term 
products to utilize Pfizer's capabilities in order to fully achieve their potential," said George F. Horner III, president 
and chief executive officer of Vicuron. "We are pleased to have a world leader in anti-infective medicines, with a 
long history of success in the area, introduce these product candidates into the market." 
Pfizer has a rich history in anti-infective therapy and the addition of these two new products to the Pfizer portfolio 
underscores Pfizer's ongoing commitment to continuously deliver lifesaving products to the marketplace that can 
treat patients with serious infections. The addition of these products will enable Pfizer to broaden its portfolio of 
anti-infective products. 
Pfizer revolutionized antifungal treatments in 1992 with the launch of Diflucan followed by the launch of Vfend, 
another important antifungal, in 2002. Pfizer believes anidulafungin will represent yet another significant advance 
in the treatment of serious fungal infections. This product candidate will be highly complementary to Vfend and 
will offer the health care provider with a range of products to more effectively treat patients faced with fungal 
infection.

Pfizer also has a long history of bringing important antibiotics to patients and health care providers. This is a 
critical time to meet the needs emerging from the increasing resistance to currently available agents. Pfizer 
currently sells Zithromax, the largest selling antibiotic in the world and Zyvox, a oxazolidinone targeted at more 
serious Gram-positive infections. 
Dalbavancin, a next generation glycopeptide, offers an important new option for patients. These serious infections 
represent an increasing burden in terms of morbidity, mortality, and economic costs. The use of the correct 
targeted antibiotic to treat the infection is becoming increasingly important in the fight against resistance. 
Completion of this transaction is subject to regulatory approval, Vicuron shareholder's approval and other 
customary closing conditions. The acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter of the year. 
Lazard and Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP advised Pfizer in the transaction. Morgan Stanley and 
O'Melveny & Myers LLP advised Vicuron.

currently sells Zithromax, the largest selling antibiotic in the world and Zyvox, a oxazolidinone targeted at more 
serious Gram-positive infections. 
Dalbavancin, a next generation glycopeptide, offers an important new option for patients. These serious infections 
represent an increasing burden in terms of morbidity, mortality, and economic costs. The use of the correct 
targeted antibiotic to treat the infection is becoming increasingly important in the fight against resistance. 
Completion of this transaction is subject to regulatory approval, Vicuron shareholder's approval and other 
customary closing conditions. The acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter of the year. 
Lazard and Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP advised Pfizer in the transaction. Morgan Stanley and

2005 JUL 19 - (NewsRx.com) -- Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (MICU, Nuovo Mercato) 
announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby Pfizer will acquire Vicuron, a 
biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel anti-infectives for both hospital-based and 
community-acquired infections. 
Under the merger agreement, Pfizer will acquire all outstanding shares of Vicuron common stock at a price of 
$29.10 per share in cash, for an aggregate equity purchase price of approximately $1.9 billion. This price 
represents a 74% premium over Vicuron's 90-day average closing share price and a 21% premium over 
Vicuron's highest historical closing price of $24.10. 
Vicuron has two products currently under new drug application (NDA) review at the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA): anidulafungin for fungal infections and dalbavancin for Gram-positive infections. 
Recently, Vicuron announced positive phase III results on anidulafungin, demonstrating superiority versus 
fluconazole in invasive candidiasis/candidemia. Anidulafungin's potential product profile will include broad 
spectrum activity against aspergillus and most candidal fungal infections. It is anticipated the product will be 
indicated for once-daily dosing for up to a month. 
Dalbavancin has shown positive results in phase III studies in complicated skin and soft tissue infections and in a 
phase II study in catheter-related bloodstream infections. The product has once-weekly dosing. Vicuron recently 
announced it has received a 3-month extension to the priority review for the dalbavancin NDA. 
"By acquiring Vicuron, we can help bring two very important new medicines to patients around the world," said 
Hank McKinnell, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer. 
"This transaction builds on Pfizer's extensive experience in anti-infectives and demonstrates our commitment to 
strengthen and broaden our pharmaceutical business through strategic product acquisitions," added McKinnell. 
Pfizer already has an existing collaboration with Vicuron that has made significant advances in the discovery of 
potential next-generation oxazolidinones, the first new class of antibiotics in more than 30 years. These orally 
active antibiotics are targeting to have improved potency and a broader spectrum of activity than existing classes 
of compounds. Several Vicuron compounds are currently being evaluated at Pfizer as potential clinical 
development candidates. 
"We believe this transaction is in the best interests of our shareholders and will enable Vicuron's two near-term 
products to utilize Pfizer's capabilities in order to fully achieve their potential," said George F. Horner III, president 
and chief executive officer of Vicuron. "We are pleased to have a world leader in anti-infective medicines, with a 
long history of success in the area, introduce these product candidates into the market." 
Pfizer has a rich history in anti-infective therapy and the addition of these two new products to the Pfizer portfolio 
underscores Pfizer's ongoing commitment to continuously deliver lifesaving products to the marketplace that can 
treat patients with serious infections. The addition of these products will enable Pfizer to broaden its portfolio of 
anti-infective products. 
Pfizer revolutionized antifungal treatments in 1992 with the launch of Diflucan followed by the launch of Vfend, 
another important antifungal, in 2002. Pfizer believes anidulafungin will represent yet another significant advance 
in the treatment of serious fungal infections. This product candidate will be highly complementary to Vfend and 
will offer the health care provider with a range of products to more effectively treat patients faced with fungal 
infection.

2005 JUL 17 - (NewsRx.com) -- Pfizer Inc and Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., announced that it has entered into 
a definitive merger agreement whereby Pfizer will acquire Vicuron, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the 
development of novel anti-infectives for both hospital-based and community-acquired infections. 
Under the merger agreement, Pfizer will acquire all outstanding shares of Vicuron common stock at a price of 
$29.10 per share in cash, for an aggregate equity purchase price of approximately $1.9 billion. This price 
represents a 74% premium over Vicuron's 90-day average closing share price and a 21% premium over 
Vicuron's highest historical closing price of $24.10. 
Vicuron has two products currently under new drug application (NDA) review at the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA): anidulafungin for fungal infections and dalbavancin for Gram-positive infections. 
Recently, Vicuron announced positive phase III results on anidulafungin, demonstrating superiority versus 
fluconazole in invasive candidiasis/candidemia. Anidulafungin's potential product profile will include 
broad-spectrum activity against aspergillus and most candidal fungal infections. It is anticipated the product will 
be indicated for once-daily dosing for up to a month. 
Dalbavancin has shown positive results in phase III studies in complicated skin and soft tissue infections and in a 
phase II study in catheter-related bloodstream infections. The product has once-weekly dosing. Vicuron recently 
announced it has received a 3-month extension to the priority review for the dalbavancin new drug application 
(NDA). 
"By acquiring Vicuron, we can help bring two very important new medicines to patients around the world" said 
Hank McKinnell, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer. 
"This transaction builds on Pfizer's extensive experience in anti-infectives and demonstrates our commitment to 
strengthen and broaden our pharmaceutical business through strategic product acquisitions," added McKinnell 
Pfizer already has an existing collaboration with Vicuron that has made significant advances in the discovery of 
potential next-generation oxazolidinones, the first new class of antibiotics in more than 30 years. These orally 
active antibiotics are targeting to have improved potency and a broader spectrum of activity than existing classes 
of compounds. Several Vicuron compounds are currently being evaluated at Pfizer as potential clinical 
development candidates. 
"We believe this transaction is in the best interests of our shareholders and will enable Vicuron's two near-term 
products to utilize Pfizer's capabilities in order to fully achieve their potential," said George F. Horner III, president 
and chief executive officer of Vicuron. "We are pleased to have a world leader in anti-infective medicines, with a 
long history of success in the area, introduce these product candidates into the market." 
Pfizer has a rich history in anti-infective therapy and the addition of these two new products to the Pfizer portfolio 
underscores Pfizer's ongoing commitment to continuously deliver lifesaving products to the marketplace that can 
treat patients with serious infections. The addition of these products will enable Pfizer to broaden its portfolio of 
anti-infective products. 
Pfizer revolutionized antifungal treatments in 1992 with the launch of Diflucan followed by the launch of Vfend, 
another important antifungal, in 2002. Pfizer believes anidulafungin will represent yet another significant advance 
in the treatment of serious fungal infections. This product candidate will be highly complementary to Vfend and 
will offer the health care provider with a range of products to more effectively treat patients faced with fungal 
infection.

Pfizer also has a long history of bringing important antibiotics to patients and health care providers. This is a 
critical time to meet the needs emerging from the increasing resistance to currently available agents. Pfizer 
currently sells Zithromax, the largest selling antibiotic in the world and Zyvox, a oxazolidinone targeted at more 
serious Gram-positive infections. 
Dalbavancin, a next generation glycopeptide, offers an important new option for patients. These serious infections 
represent an increasing burden in terms of morbidity, mortality, and economic costs. The use of the correct 
targeted antibiotic to treat the infection is becoming increasingly important in the fight against resistance. 
Completion of this transaction is subject to regulatory approval, Vicuron shareholder's approval and other 
customary closing conditions. The acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter of the year.

broad-spectrum activity against aspergillus and most candidal fungal infections. It is anticipated the product will 
be indicated for once-daily dosing for up to a month. 
Dalbavancin has shown positive results in phase III studies in complicated skin and soft tissue infections and in a 
phase II study in catheter-related bloodstream infections. The product has once-weekly dosing. Vicuron recently 
announced it has received a 3-month extension to the priority review for the dalbavancin new drug application 
(NDA). 
"By acquiring Vicuron, we can help bring two very important new medicines to patients around the world" said 
Hank McKinnell, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer. 
"This transaction builds on Pfizer's extensive experience in anti-infectives and demonstrates our commitment to 
strengthen and broaden our pharmaceutical business through strategic product acquisitions," added McKinnell 
Pfizer already has an existing collaboration with Vicuron that has made significant advances in the discovery of 
potential next-generation oxazolidinones, the first new class of antibiotics in more than 30 years. These orally 
active antibiotics are targeting to have improved potency and a broader spectrum of activity than existing classes 
of compounds. Several Vicuron compounds are currently being evaluated at Pfizer as potential clinical 
development candidates. 
"We believe this transaction is in the best interests of our shareholders and will enable Vicuron's two near-term 
products to utilize Pfizer's capabilities in order to fully achieve their potential," said George F. Horner III, president 
and chief executive officer of Vicuron. "We are pleased to have a world leader in anti-infective medicines, with a 
long history of success in the area, introduce these product candidates into the market." 
Pfizer has a rich history in anti-infective therapy and the addition of these two new products to the Pfizer portfolio 
underscores Pfizer's ongoing commitment to continuously deliver lifesaving products to the marketplace that can 
treat patients with serious infections. The addition of these products will enable Pfizer to broaden its portfolio of 
anti-infective products. 
Pfizer revolutionized antifungal treatments in 1992 with the launch of Diflucan followed by the launch of Vfend, 
another important antifungal, in 2002. Pfizer believes anidulafungin will represent yet another significant advance 
in the treatment of serious fungal infections. This product candidate will be highly complementary to Vfend and 
will offer the health care provider with a range of products to more effectively treat patients faced with fungal 
infection.

Pfizer also has a long history of bringing important antibiotics to patients and health care providers. This is a 
critical time to meet the needs emerging from the increasing resistance to currently available agents. Pfizer 
currently sells Zithromax, the largest selling antibiotic in the world and Zyvox, a oxazolidinone targeted at more 
serious Gram-positive infections. 
Dalbavancin, a next generation glycopeptide, offers an important new option for patients. These serious infections 
represent an increasing burden in terms of morbidity, mortality, and economic costs. The use of the correct 
targeted antibiotic to treat the infection is becoming increasingly important in the fight against resistance. 
Completion of this transaction is subject to regulatory approval, Vicuron shareholder's approval and other 
customary closing conditions. The acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter of the year.

2005 JUL 11 - (NewsRx.com) -- Pfizer Inc and Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., announced that it has entered into 
a definitive merger agreement whereby Pfizer will acquire Vicuron, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the 
development of novel anti-infectives for both hospital-based and community-acquired infections. 
Under the merger agreement, Pfizer will acquire all outstanding shares of Vicuron common stock at a price of 
$29.10 per share in cash, for an aggregate equity purchase price of approximately $1.9 billion. This price 
represents a 74% premium over Vicuron's 90-day average closing share price and a 21% premium over 
Vicuron's highest historical closing price of $24.10. 
Vicuron has two products currently under new drug application (NDA) review at the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA): anidulafungin for fungal infections and dalbavancin for Gram-positive infections.

Pfizer loaded its product pipeline with two late-stage experimental anti-infective treatments, agreeing to buy 
biotechnology group Vicuron Pharmaceuticals for Dollars 1.9bn in cash. 
The deal highlights plans by the world's largest pharmaceuticals group by sales to find and buy new products to 
offset numerous patent expirations on key drugs in the next few years. 
It plans to slash Dollars 4bn in costs and make other strategic moves this year to return to earnings growth next 
year. Vicuron gives Pfizer a new antibiotic, as a potential replacement for Zithromax, which faces patent expiry 
soon. It also gives Pfizer a new anti-fungal drug. Both are under review at the Food and Drug Administration. 
Hank McKinnell, chief executive, said the transaction built on Pfizer's extensive experience in anti-infectives. 
A Deutsche Bank healthcare investment banking analysis estimated that Pfizer's anticipated Dollars 60bn in cash 
could buy most of the listed US biotechnology sector. 
Pfizer agreed to pay a large premium for Vicuron, but gets two nearly approved drugs and some other 
anti-infective compounds. Vicuron shareholders are to receive Dollars 29.10 per share, an 84 per cent premium 
over Wednesday's close. 
New anti-infective drugs are increasingly in demand as resistant strains continue to emerge. 
Separately, Wyeth yesterday said the FDA approved its new antibiotic Tygacil for complicated abdominal and skin 
infections. Christopher Bowe, New York

In the latest foray by a pharmaceutical behemoth outside its research labs for biotech drugs, Pfizer Inc. said 
Thursday it would pay $1.9 billion in cash for a tiny company that makes a new breed of antibiotics. 
Pfizer is offering to shareholders of Vicuron Pharmaceuticals $29.10 a share, a 74 percent premium over the 
biotech's average stock price the past 90 days. 
Such a hefty premium underscores the industry's need to bolster lackluster research programs and replace 
lucrative drugs soon to be threatened by generic competition because of expiring patents. 
Pfizer's share price rose 17 cents to close at $28.60 on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday. Vicuron shares 
soared 78.5 percent, or $12.41, to close at $28.21 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Vicuron is based in the Philadelphia suburb King of Prussia and employs about 200 workers. 
Despite their high-profile safety and acquisition problems, most large drug companies are each still awash in 
billions of dollars in cash, some of it repatriated from overseas operations because of recent changes in the U.S. 
tax code. Pfizer expects a $28 billion windfall in such overseas profits. 
That cash position could herald a new wave of similar acquisitions, analysts said. Pfizer itself is sitting on $24 
billion in cash and investments and has an annual cash flow of $16 billion. The Vicuron acquisition, which Pfizer 
hopes to close by the third quarter, will be the third such purchase this year for the New York-based company. 
Analysts said the acquisition reinforces the notion that biotechnology serves as the pharmaceutical industry's 
research and development arm. Many biotechnology companies are trading near annual lows, making them ripe 
for a takeover. 
"With all the weak pipelines in large pharmaceuticals, there is a shortage of drugs nearing the market," said 
analyst Scott Henry of Oppenheimer & Co. "You're likely to see more acquisitions of small and mid-size 
companies." 
Pfizer is slated to lose as much as $9 billion in revenue in the next four years when patents expire on 
anti-depressant Zoloft, allergy medicine Zyrtec and blood-pressure medicine Norvasc. 
Pfizer's Zithromax, with annual sales of $1.85 billion, is currently the world's best-selling antibiotic. It faces generic 
competition later this year when its patent expires. Analysts said the Vicuron acquisition is a good -- if pricey -- fit 
for Pfizer. 
The deal gives Pfizer two infection-fighting drugs under review for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration: anidulafungin for fungal infections and dalbavancin for skin and soft tissue infections. With an 
antibiotic sales force already in place, analysts said Pfizer should have little trouble marketing the new drugs if 
they're approved by the FDA later this year. 
"This transaction builds on Pfizer's extensive experience in anti-infectives and demonstrates our commitment to 
strengthen and broaden our pharmaceutical business through strategic product acquisitions," said Pfizer 
chairman and chief executive Hank McKinnell.

NEW YORK (AP) - Pfizer Inc., the world's biggest drug maker, agreed on Thursday to acquire Vicuron 
Pharmaceuticals Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of new anti-infection medicines, 
for $1.9 billion in cash, the companies announced. Shares of Vicuron soared 76 percent in morning trading. 
Under the merger agreement, Pfizer would purchase outstanding Vicuron stock at $29.10 per share, an 84 
percent premium over its closing price on Wednesday and a 74 percent premium to the stock's three-month 
average closing price. 
Vicuron, based in King of Prussia, Pa., develops anti-infectives for both hospital- and community-acquired 
infections. 
The deal gives New York-based Pfizer two products under review for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration: anidulafungin for fungal infections and dalbavancin for skin and soft tissue infections. Sales of 
Pfizer's anti-fungal Diflucan are down following expiration of its U.S. patent last year. 
"This transaction builds on Pfizer's extensive experience in anti-infectives and demonstrates our commitment to 
strengthen and broaden our pharmaceutical business through strategic product acquisitions," said Hank 
McKinnell, Pfizer chairman and CEO. 
"We are pleased to have a world leader in anti-infective medicines, with a long history of success in the area, 
introduce these product candidates into the market", said George F. Horner III, president and CEO of Vicuron. 
Pfizer and Vicuron already are collaborating and have made significant advances in the discovery of potential 
next-generation oxazolidinones, the first new class of antibiotics in more than 30 years. 
Vicuron had about 60.86 million shares outstanding as of March 31. The deal is expected to close in the third 
quarter of 2005. 
Shares of Pfizer fell 13 cents to $28.30 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where they have 
traded in a 52-week range of $21.99 to $35.51. Shares of Vicuron rose $12.05, or 76 percent, to $27.85 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market, surpassing the previous 52-week high of $18.33.

New York-based Pfizer on Wednesday announced plans to acquire Pennsylvania-based biotechnology company 
Vicuron Pharmaceuticals for $1.9 billion, the AP/Chicago Tribune reports (AP/Chicago Tribune, 6/16). Under the 
agreement, Pfizer will pay $29.10 per share for all outstanding shares of Vicuron common stock. The purchase 
price represents a 74% premium over the 90-day average closing price of Vicuron stock. The companies expect 
the acquisition, which requires approval from regulators and Vicuron shareholders, to close in the third quarter 
(Hensley, Wall Street Journal, 6/17). Pfizer CFO Dov Goldstein said that the companies signed the agreement on 
Wednesday after Vicuron considered competitive offers from other companies, which he declined to name 
(Ginsberg, Philadelphia Inquirer, 6/17). Vicuron, which develops medications for hospital- and 
community-acquired infections, currently has two treatments under consideration at FDA that could receive 
approval within the next several months. 
One of the medications -- anidulafungin -- is a daily treatment for fungal infections, and the second -- dalbavancin 
-- is an intravenous antibiotic administered weekly to treat infections of the skin and soft tissue (Wall Street 
Journal, 6/17). According to USA Today, the two medications would "offset lost sales in two of Pfizer's top sellers" 
-- the anti-fungal Diflucan, which lost patent protection last year, and the antibiotic Zithromax, which will lose 
patent protection this year (Hopkins, USA Today, 6/17). Pfizer Chair and CEO Hank McKinnell said, "This 
transaction builds on Pfizer's extensive experience in anti-infectives" (AP/Chicago Tribune, 6/16). 
Analyst Reaction 
Richard Evans, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said, "Near-term sales are a priority for 
everyone, and it's logical for Pfizer to buy two near-term products" (Wall Street Journal, 6/17). Merrill Lynch 
analyst David Risinger on Thursday wrote that by 2009 the total sales of the two Vicuron medications could 
reach $200 million to $400 million annually, adding at most three cents per share to Pfizer earnings. Risinger 
wrote that Pfizer might have benefited more from a $2 billion repurchase of company shares, which would have 
immediately increased earnings by two cents per share (Berenson, New York Times, 6/17). 
Commentary 
Acquisitions of biotech companies by large pharmaceutical companies "can help grow sales, but they won't cure 
the industry's broader complaints," Shereen El Feki, a health writer for the Economist, says in a commentary on 
APM's "Marketplace" on Thursday. According to El Feki, "all this pressure on drug makers is a good thing," and 
companies will "have to do more in the future than just push pills" to justify high prices for prescription drugs (El 
Feki, "Marketplace," APM, 6/16). The complete segment is available online in RealPlayer.

Pfizer to Acquire 
Vicuron Pharmaceuticals to Extend Its Research Commitment in 
Anti-Infectives 
Vicuron products anidulafungin and dalbavancin under review by U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration 
NEW YORK, and KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa., June 16 -- Pfizer Inc and Vicuron 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. today announced that they have entered into a definitive 
merger agreement whereby Pfizer will acquire Vicuron, a biopharmaceutical 
company focused on the development of novel anti-infectives for both hospitalbased 
and community-acquired infections. 
Under the merger agreement, Pfizer will acquire all outstanding shares of 
Vicuron common stock at a price of $29.10 per share in cash, for an aggregate 
equity purchase price of approximately $1.9 billion. This price represents a 
74 percent premium over Vicuron's 90 day average closing share price and a 21 
percent premium over Vicuron's highest historical closing price of $24.10 on

Vicuron has two products currently under New Drug Application (NDA) review 
at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): anidulafungin for fungal 
infections and dalbavancin for Gram-positive infections. Recently, Vicuron 
announced positive Phase III results on anidulafungin, demonstrating 
superiority versus fluconazole in invasive candidiasis/candidemia. 
Anidulafungin's potential product profile will include broad spectrum activity 
against aspergillus and most candidal fungal infections. It is anticipated 
the product will be indicated for once-daily dosing for up to a month. 
Dalbavancin has shown positive results in Phase III studies in complicated 
skin and soft tissue infections and in a Phase II study in catheter-related 
bloodstream infections. The product has once-weekly dosing. Vicuron recently 
announced it has received a three-month extension to the priority review for 
the dalbavancin NDA. The FDA review is expected to be completed on or before 
September 21, 2005. 
"By acquiring Vicuron, we can help bring two very important new medicines 
to patients around the world" said Hank McKinnell, chairman and chief 
executive officer of Pfizer. 
"This transaction builds on Pfizer's extensive experience in antiinfectives 
and demonstrates our commitment to strengthen and broaden our 
pharmaceutical business through strategic product acquisitions," added 
McKinnell 
Pfizer already has an existing collaboration with Vicuron that has made 
significant advances in the discovery of potential next-generation 
oxazolidinones, the first new class of antibiotics in more than 30 years. 
These orally-active antibiotics are targeting to have improved potency and a 
broader spectrum of activity than existing classes of compounds. Several 
Vicuron compounds are currently being evaluated at Pfizer as potential 
clinical development candidates. 
"We believe this transaction is in the best interests of our shareholders

Page 51 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
and will enable Vicuron's two near-term products to utilize Pfizer's 
capabilities in order to fully achieve their potential", said George F. Horner 
III, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vicuron. "We are pleased to 
have a world leader in anti-infective medicines, with a long history of 
success in the area, introduce these product candidates into the market." 
Pfizer has a rich history in anti-infective therapy and the addition of 
these two new products to the Pfizer portfolio underscores Pfizer's ongoing 
commitment to continuously deliver lifesaving products to the marketplace that 
can treat patients with serious infections. The addition of these products 
will enable Pfizer to broaden its portfolio of anti-infective products. 
Pfizer revolutionized antifungal treatments in 1992 with the launch of 
Diflucan followed by the launch of Vfend, another important antifungal, in 
2002. Pfizer believes anidulafungin will represent yet another significant 
advance in the treatment of serious fungal infections. This product candidate 
will be highly complementary to Vfend and will offer the health care provider 
with a range of products to more effectively treat patients faced with fungal 
infection. 
Pfizer also has a long history of bringing important antibiotics to 
patients and health care providers. This is a critical time to meet the needs 
emerging from the increasing resistance to currently available agents. Pfizer 
currently sells Zithromax, the largest selling antibiotic in the world and 
Zyvox, a oxazolidinone targeted at more serious Gram-positive infections. 
Dalbavancin, a next generation glycopeptide, offers an important new option 
for patients. These serious infections represent an increasing burden in 
terms of morbidity, mortality, and economic costs. The use of the correct 
targeted antibiotic to treat the infection is becoming increasingly important 
in the fight against resistance. 
Completion of this transaction is subject to regulatory approval, Vicuron 
shareholder's approval and other customary closing conditions. The 
acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter of the year. 
Lazard and Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP advised Pfizer in the 
transaction. Morgan Stanley and O'Melveny & Myers LLP advised Vicuron. 
Vicuron is listed on the Nasdaq National Market and the Nuovo Mercato under

NEW YORK and KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa., June 16 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc. and Vicuron 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby Pfizer 
will acquire Vicuron, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel anti-infectives for both 
hospital-based and community-acquired infections. 
Under the merger agreement, Pfizer will acquire all outstanding shares of Vicuron common stock at a price of 
$29.10 per share in cash, for an aggregate equity purchase price of approximately $1.9 billion. This price 
represents a 74 percent premium over Vicuron's 90 day average closing share price and a 21 percent premium 
over Vicuron's highest historical closing price of $24.10 on January 16, 2004. 
Vicuron has two products currently under New Drug Application (NDA) review at the U.S. Food and Drug

Pfizer and Vicuron have an existing collaboration to research potential next-generation oxazolidinones. These 
orally active antibiotics - the first new class of antibiotics in more than 30 years - are targeting improved potency 
and a broader spectrum of activity than existing classes of compounds. 
Vicuron currently has two products under New Drug Application review at the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration: anidulafungin for fungal infections and dalbavancin for Gram-positive infections. Dalbavancin has 
shown positive results in complicated skin and soft-tissue infections, and the companies expect the FDA's priority 
review of dalbavancin to be completed by Sept. 21. 
"This transaction builds on Pfizer's extensive experience in anti-infectives and demonstrates our commitment to 
strengthen and broaden our pharmaceutical business through strategic product acquisitions," said Pfizer 
Chairman and Chief Executive Hank McKinnell in the release. 
Vicuron President and Chief Executive George F. Horner III said, "This transaction is in the best interests of our 
shareholders and will enable Vicuron's two near-term products to utilize Pfizer's capabilities in order to fully 
achieve their potential."

A WALL STREET JOURNAL ONLINE NEWS ROUNDUP 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to acquire Vicuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MICU) for $1.9 
billion, in a move to expand its offerings of anti-infective products. 
Under the agreement, Pfizer will pay $29.10 a share in cash for Vicuron, a U.S.-Italian biopharmaceutical 
company that develops anti-infectives for both hospital-based and community-acquired infections. 
Vicuron's Nasdaq-traded stock closed Wednesday at $15.80 a share, up six cents. The company's Italy-listed 
shares surged 75% Thursday to 22.96 euros, or $27.78. 
Pfizer said the price represents a 74% premium over Vicuron's 90-day average closing share price, and a 21% 
premium over Vicuron's highest historical closing price of $24.10 on Jan. 16, 2004. 
Vicuron is based in King of Prussia, Pa. It operates a research program in Fremont, Calif., and runs a research 
center in Gerenzano in northern Italy. The company also has a corporate administration operation in Milan and a 
manufacturing site in Pisticci, in southern Italy. 
The company expects to close the acquisition in the third quarter, subject to regulatory approval, Vicuron 
shareholders' approval and other customary closing conditions. 
"By acquiring Vicuron, we can help bring two very important new medicines to patients around the world," said 
Hank McKinnell, chairman and chief executive of Pfizer. 
Vicuron has two products under new drug application review at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
Pfizer already has an existing collaboration with Vicuron, developing new antibiotics. Pfizer launched its own 
antifungal treatment Diflucan in 1992, which was followed with the launch of Vfend in 2002. 
Lazard Ltd. and Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP advised Pfizer in the transaction. Morgan Stanley and 
O'Melveny & Myers LLP advised Vicuron.

NEW YORK (AP) - Pfizer Inc., the world's biggest drug maker, agreed on Thursday to acquire Vicuron 
Pharmaceuticals Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of new anti-infection medicines, 
for $1.9 billion (euro1.6 billion) in cash, the companies announced. 
Under the merger agreement, Pfizer would purchase outstanding Vicuron stock at $29.10 per share, an 84 
percent premium over its closing price on Wednesday and a 74 percent premium to the stock's three-month 
average closing price. 
Vicuron, based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, develops anti-infectives for both hospital- and 
community-acquired infections. 
The deal gives New York-based Pfizer two products under review for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration: anidulafungin for fungal infections and dalbavancin for skin and soft tissue infections. Sales of 
Pfizer's anti-fungal Diflucan are down following expiration of its U.S. patent last year. 
"This transaction builds on Pfizer's extensive experience in anti-infectives and demonstrates our commitment to 
strengthen and broaden our pharmaceutical business through strategic product acquisitions," said Hank 
McKinnell, Pfizer chairman and CEO. 
"We are pleased to have a world leader in anti-infective medicines, with a long history of success in the area, 
introduce these product candidates into the market", said George F. Horner III, president and CEO of Vicuron. 
Pfizer and Vicuron already are collaborating and have made significant advances in the discovery of potential 
next-generation oxazolidinones, the first new class of antibiotics in more than 30 years. 
Vicuron had about 60.86 million shares outstanding as of March 31. The deal is expected to close in the third 
quarter of 2005. 
Shares of Pfizer fell 13 cents to $28.30 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where they have 
traded in a 52-week range of $21.99 to $35.51. Shares of Vicuron rose $12.05, or 76 percent, to $27.85 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market, surpassing the previous 52-week high of $18.33.
