DALLAS, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Kimberly-Clark Corp , the maker of Kleenex tissues, said Wednesday it would buy 
Safeskin Corp , a leading maker of disposable gloves used in healthcare, in a transaction valued at $850 million, 
tapping the $3 billion latex and synthetic glove market. 
Under the agreement, shareholders of Safeskin, which has the number one market share in the U.S. exam glove 
market, will receive 0.1956 of a share of Kimberly-Clark common stock for each share of Safeskin common. 
Based on the closing price of Kimberly-Clark stock on Nov. 16, the transaction has a total value of about $850 
million, which includes assumed debt and outstanding options of approximately $155 million. 
To complete the acquisition, Kimberly-Clark, which currently has about 544 million shares outstanding, will issue 
approximately 10.5 million shares in exchange for Safeskin's shares. 
With the addition of Safeskin, Kimberly-Clark's professional health care operation is expected to have annual 
sales of about $950 million in 2000. 
"We are committed to significantly increasing our presence in health care," said Wayne Sanders, chairman and 
chief executive officer of Kimberly-Clark, which also holds market share positions in sterilisation wrap, surgical 
gowns, face masks and other protective apparel. 
David Murray, president of Kimberly-Clark's professional health care sector, will lead the combined operation. 
Safeskin's chairman, president and chief executive Richard Jaffe will become a consultant. 
The transaction, which will be tax free to Safeskin shareholders, is expected to be completed in early 2000. 
In connection with today's announcement, Safeskin said it has granted Kimberly-Clark an option to purchase up 
to 14 percent of Safeskin's stock under certain conditions. In addition, stockholders of Safeskin, beneficially 
owning approximately 24 percent of the outstanding shares have agreed to vote their equity interests in the 
company in favour of the transaction. 
Kimberly-Clark shares closed up 1 at 68-1/16 and Safeskin shares finished up 9/16 at 10-13/16 on Wednesday.
