(c) 2004 Reuters Limited 
NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI.N), which fired three executives over its accounting for 
bad loans, on Friday restated first-half profit higher by $25.1 million, more than it had forecast, to fix the mistakes. 
The No. 7 U.S. bank also said third-quarter profit rose 11 percent to $368.8 million, or $1.30 per share, from 
$331.6 million, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier, helped by higher fee and lending income and improved credit 
quality. It said, however, that corporate loan demand remains weak. 
Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates on average forecast profit of $1.31 per share. SunTrust delayed results by 
one month after it disclosed the accounting problems. 
SunTrust on Wednesday fired chief credit officer Sandra Jansky and two other executives. The company found 
"numerous errors" in calculating how much to set aside for loan losses and said auditor PriceWaterhouseCoopers 
LLP had been misled. 
The Atlanta-based bank expects the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to begin its informal probe next 
week, and Chief Executive L. Phillip Humann said on a conference call that SunTrust is also in "daily touch" with 
banking regulators. Federal Reserve spokesman Andrew Williams declined to comment. 
"Management has done a good job about being up front about the accounting," said Kevin Fitzsimmons, an 
analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP. "The key question is whether investors over time agree with 
management that internal controls in other areas are fine." Fitzsimmons rates SunTrust a "hold." 
RESTATEMENT 
SunTrust cut reported loan loss set-asides by $41.6 million. It restated first-quarter profit upward by $3.4 million, 
or 2 cents per share, to $361.8 million, or $1.28 per share. Second-quarter profit was raised by $21.7 million, or 7 
cents per share, to $386.6 million, or $1.36 per share. 
Previously, the bank estimated the revisions would increase profit overall by $22.4 million, or 8 cents per share. 
The pre-tax restatement was $41.5 million, higher than SunTrust's previous estimate of $31.6 million. 
SunTrust has restated profit twice in six years to fix its accounting for bad loans. 
SunTrust shares rose 4 cents to $73.10 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have risen 2 percent this year, 
while the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index is up 6 percent. 
REVENUE, CREDIT QUALITY UP 
Third-quarter revenue rose 7 percent to $1.52 billion. Lending income rose 6 percent to $893.7 million, and fee 
income rose 9 percent to $627.7 million. Noninterest expense rose 8 percent to $929.8 million. 
SunTrust set aside $41.8 million for bad loans, down 48 percent. Net charge-offs fell 36 percent to $51 million, 
and nonperforming assets fell 34 percent to $304.2 million. 
Loans, deposits and assets rose 7 percent, 3 percent and 1 percent to $84.6 billion, $83.1 billion and $127.8 
billion, respectively. 
Humann said corporate loan growth will probably remain "flattish, with perhaps a tiny amount of upside," in 2005.

Page 4 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Analyst Jon Balkind of Fox-Pitt Kelton Inc. wrote that SunTrust was "reasonably cautious" on prospects for 
deposit growth and margin expansion. 
SunTrust on Oct. 1 closed its $7.4 billion purchase of National Commerce Financial Corp. of Memphis, 
Tennessee, filling holes in its retail footprint in the U.S. Southeast. 
Chief Financial Officer Mark Chancy expects the purchase to cut per-share profit by about 6 cents in the fourth 
quarter and 10 cents in 2005, and increase it 8 cents starting in 2006. 
For 2005, he expects "high-single-digit" fee income growth and "mid-single-digit" growth in lending income and 
expenses. 
Before acquiring National Commerce, SunTrust had 28,083 employees, 1,215 banking offices and 2,235 
automated teller machines in Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Maryland, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and the 
District of Columbia.

ATLANTA, Oct. 1 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- SunTrust Banks, Inc. today announced the completion of its merger 
with National Commerce Financial Corporation (NCF), creating a combined financial services enterprise with 
combined assets of more than $152 billion, deposits of $101 billion, and more than 1,700 branches in 
fast-growing Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets. 
"Today marks an important legal and organizational milestone as we continue the work of combining our two 
companies," said L. Phillip Humann, SunTrust chairman, president and CEO. "But the closing of this transaction 
does not signal any immediate changes for the vast majority of NCF customers; they will continue to do business 
as they always have, with the same people they know and trust." Mr. Humann noted that conversion of NCF 
accounts, and the introduction of the SunTrust "brand" into former NCF markets, will not take place until 2005 and 
will be preceded by "extensive and timely customer communication." 
Merger Consideration 
Based on election results and the average closing price of SunTrust common stock of $69.574 for the five-day 
period ending on September 30,2004, and applying the proration provisions set forth in the merger agreement, 
the merger consideration received by former NCF stockholders is as follows: 
-- NCF stockholders who elected cash receive $34.4578 in cash (the "cash 
consideration") per NCF share; 
-- NCF stockholders who elected stock receive .4953 shares of SunTrust 
common stock (the "stock consideration") per NCF share; and 
-- non-electing NCF stockholders receive the cash consideration with 
respect to approximately 87.28% of the NCF shares they own and the 
stock consideration with respect to their remaining NCF shares. 
New Directors Named 
Coincident with the merger closing, SunTrust also announced four former National Commerce Financial 
Corporation directors have joined the SunTrust Banks, Inc. board of directors, bringing to 18 the total number of 
SunTrust directors. The new SunTrust directors are: 
-- Thomas C. Farnsworth, Jr., Farnsworth Investment Co., Memphis, 
Tennessee; 
-- Blake P. Garrett, Jr., Partner, Garrett & Garrett Co., Fountain Inn, 
South Carolina; 
-- Thomas M. Garrott, former Chairman of the Executive Committee and 
former Chairman of the Board, National 
Commerce Financial Corporation, 
Memphis, Tennessee; 
-- Dr. Phail Wynn, Jr., President, Durham Technical Community College, 
Durham, North Carolina.

Shareholders of National Commerce Financial Corp. and Atlanta- based SunTrust Banks Inc. overwhelmingly 
approved the combination of the two companies at meetings Wednesday. 
The $7 billion deal should be sealed during the third quarter, which starts Oct. 1. 
SunTrust recorded 97.3 percent of the shares for the transaction. About 98.7 percent of the NCFC shares voted 
were cast in favor of the stock and cash deal with 1.3 percent abstaining or against. 
Ninety-one of those shares are owned by the Community Reinvestment Association of North Carolina, whose 
director of research, Tanya Wolfram, said NCFC left a trail of broken promises in the four years since buying 
Central Carolina Bank and its parent CCB Inc. 
The company went back on promises to increase lending to African- Americans and low income borrowers in 
North Carolina, she said at the NCFC meeting. 
The bank set higher mortgage rates on small mortgages - the ones most likely to be requested by low-income 
home buyers - than on large ones and did less community development work than before the 2000 buyout, 
Wolfram said. 
Nor did the company follow through on promises of increasing diversity among executives or the rest of the 
workforce, she said. 
Meanwhile, NCFC executives are collecting more than $17 million in bonuses for the merger. 
"That doesn't improve shareholder value and it's not based on performance," Wolfram said. 
NCFC received an outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating in its last evaluation from the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, chairman Eugene McDonald replied. 
The rating, the best possible, he said, "was based on stringent tests of community lending." 
That is " a lot to be proud of," McDonald said. 
"There's always more we could do and we plan to do more (after the merger)," he told Wolfram. "We're looking 
forward to working with your organization." 
CRA-NC wasn't the only organization contesting the merger. 
Inner City Press/Fair Finance Watch of New York City had asked the Federal Reserve for a hearing on NCFC's 
and SunTrust's lending record in minority, low and moderate income neighborhoods. The Fed approved the bank 
deal late Tuesday without scheduling that hearing. 
The group questioned SunTrust's relationships with unaffiliated payday lenders, car title lending companies, and 
other nontraditional providers of financial services. SunTrust officials said the bank was voluntarily revising its 
credit policies to prohibit future loans to such businesses and that the policy would apply to National Commerce 
after the merger. 
"Needless to say, we'll be monitoring," said Matthew Lee, executive director of the New York group.

With regulatory and shareholder approvals out of the way, the combination is in the home stretch, said L. Phillip 
Humann, chairman, president and chief executive officer of SunTrust. He didn't specify a date for that action. 
"What today's votes say is that shareholders recognize the potential value in our combined enterprise," Humann 
said. "All of us, at both organizations, are committed to translating that potential into solid, measurable results."

CHARLOTTE (Dow Jones)--SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) shareholders on Wednesday approved the acquisition of 
National Commerce Financial Corp. (NCF), which SunTrust Chairman and Chief Executive L. Phillip Humann 
said remains on track to close next month. 
At a meeting in Atlanta that was broadcast on the Internet, executives said 191.4 million shares of SunTrust 
holders, or 97.3% of shares represented at the meeting, voted in favor of the acquisition. 
SunTrust expects to issue about 75.9 million common shares and $1.8 billion in cash to National Commerce 
holders in the transaction, valuing the deal at $6.92 billion, based on SunTrust's recent price of $67.36 a share. 
Under the May agreement, National Commerce shareholders can exchange their shares for cash, SunTrust stock 
or a combination of the two. 
National Commerce shareholders are scheduled to vote on the acquisition at a meeting in Memphis at 11 a.m. 
EDT. 
Humann said SunTrust expects current shareholder to own about 78.9% of the combined company, while 
National Commerce holders are expected to own about 21.1%. 
SunTrust is on "the homestretch" for closing the deal, Humann said, adding that the acquisition is "on track, on 
time and on budget." 
The merger completion won't be that visible to National Commerce customers until next year, when SunTrust 
converts customer accounts to its systems and introduces its signs and names in the Memphis bank's footprint, 
he said.

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve Board required the divestiture of three bank branches in its approval 
Tuesday of SunTrust Banks Inc.'s $7 billion deal to buy National Commerce Financial Corp. 
Shareholder votes for both banks are set for today. 
The Fed said the deal would create the nation's ninth-largest bank, with $152.1 billion of assets. The new bank 
would control $103 billion of the nation's deposits, or 1.6%. 
On Monday, SunTrust's chairman and chief executive, Phillip Humann, said that on completion of the deal it 
would close 60 of the post-merger company's 1,723 branches in 12 states. It is unclear if these closings will 
include the three branches that the Fed is requiring SunTrust to divest in Lawrence County, Tenn., for the deal. 
There SunTrust would have controlled 25.4% of the market deposits, the Fed said in the 44-page order. 
Also Tuesday, a Fed spokesman said the agency is extending the comment period on the application of PNC 
Financial Services Group Inc. to buy Riggs National Corp. for $779 million in cash. The spokesman said officials 
were extending the deadline from Sept. 9 to Oct. 1 because of a delay in legal notices published in two 
newspapers. As of last week, the Fed had only received one comment letter on the deal, which was announced 
July 16.

NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI.N) will close about 60 branches after the completion of 
its acquisition of National Commerce Financial Corp. (NCF.N), its chief executive said on Monday. 
SunTrust chairman and CEO Phillip Humann, who made the comments on a Webcast from the Lehman Brothers 
2004 Financial Services Conference, said the number would include both SunTrust and NCF branches, which 
total 1723 between them. 
Atlanta-based SunTrust announced the $6.6 billion deal with Memphis, Tennessee-based National Commerce in 
May, saying the acquisition filled critical holes in the Southeastern U.S. bank retail footprint while strengthening its 
focus on mid-market business. 
The deal is expected to close early in the fourth quarter pending shareholder votes set by both banks for 
Wednesday and regulatory approval.

company's business in North Carolina and South Carolina. 
According to L. Phillip Humann, SunTrust chairman, president and CEO, and William R. Reed Jr., National 
Commerce Financial president and CEO and vice chairman-designate of SunTrust, the changes will take effect 
upon completion of the companies' previously announced merger. Messrs. Humann and Reed noted that overall 
merger integration planning is "on track, on target and on schedule" for that completion to take place in the fourth 
quarter of 2004 pending regulatory and shareholder approval. 
"Our announcement today underscores SunTrust's commitment to an operating model that places a high degree 
of decision-making authority in the hands of our local management teams while also making it easy for customers 
to benefit from the significant resources and capabilities that come from our position as one of the nation's largest 
banking organizations," said Mr. Humann. 
"Under the post-merger structure National Commerce Financial customers will by and large continue to be 
served by the same people they know and trust, in the same locations as before," said Mr. Reed. "That's 
consistent with our number one merger goal: to make this transition a smooth and positive experience from the 
customer's standpoint." 
The new Durham-based Carolinas Banking Group will encompass 254 branches and approximately 1,900 
employees, and brings to four the number of SunTrust banking groups, the company's primary geographic 
banking units. The others are based in Atlanta (covering primarily Georgia and Tennessee), Orlando (covering 
Florida) and Richmond (covering Virginia, Maryland and the District of Colombia). 
-- Richard Furr, currently chief operating officer of NCF has been 
designated chairman, president and CEO of the Carolinas Banking Group 
in the post-merger SunTrust organization. Scott Edwards, who is 
currently NCF's chief administrative officer, will be named Carolinas 
Banking Group credit officer. 
The Group will consist of four regions in North Carolina and South Carolina: 
-- Mecklenburg Region, based in Charlotte with Carl Wicker as chairman, 
president and CEO. 
-- Triad Region, based in Greensboro with Rocky Johnson as chairman, 
president and CEO. 
-- Triangle Region, headquartered in Raleigh with Robert Jones as 
chairman, president and CEO. 
-- South Carolina Region, based in Greenville with Chuck Perry as 
chairman, president and CEO. 
Messers. Wicker, Johnson and Perry are currently regional presidents in their respective markets for NCF's 
Central Carolina Bank. Mr. Jones, who currently serves as National Bank of Commerce's (NBC) chief credit 
officer, will succeed Rick Glover who has announced plans to retire. 
Additionally, 
-- John Stallings, currently director of retail banking for NCF with 
responsibility for small business and group banking, will become the

Memphis operations, which will be part of the Atlanta- based Central Banking Group in the post-merger SunTrust 
organization. 
-- David Popwell, currently NCF's executive vice president responsible 
for NCF's Financial Enterprise businesses has been named chairman and

SunTrust's Profit Increases 10%

Second-quarter U.S. bank earnings kicked off on a positive note, with SunTrust Banks Inc. reporting a 10% 
increase in net income and its executives giving an optimistic outlook for the industry. 
The Atlanta bank reported net income of $364.8 million, or $1.29 a share, compared with $330.4 million, or $1.17 
a share, a year earlier. 
Total revenue rose 7.1% to $1.51 billion from $1.41 billion. Revenue excluding securities losses and gains grew 
10% to $1.52 billion. 
The bank's credit quality showed improving trends, with total nonperforming assets declining 37% to $324.4 
million compared with last year. The bank's provision for loan losses, or money that it set aside in the period for 
bad loans, declined 53% to $38.8 million. Total net charge-offs in the period declined 54% to $37.6 million, but 
SunTrust warned that level, while consistent with improving credit quality, was unusually low and isn't expected to 
continue at that pace. 
All of SunTrust's businesses -- retail banking, commercial banking, corporate and investment banking, mortgage 
banking and wealth management -- turned in improved performances, said L. Phillip Humann, SunTrust's 
chairman, president and chief executive. 
"We're seeing a continuation of the positive performance pattern that's been steadily picking up steam for the past 
two or three quarters, and we expect that to continue," Mr. Humann said. "Virtually all earnings trends are 
headed in the right direction...The external environment for banks is a lot more accommodating for banks than it 
has been." 
Taxable net interest income rose 9.2% to $885.1 million. Net interest margin, or the profit pocketed on the 
difference between borrowing costs and lending rates, was 3.13%, up from 3.05% a year earlier. 
The bank said its consumer and overall commercial loans showed growth momentum "despite a continued lack of 
demand for bank loans by large corporate borrowers." Average loans increased 9% to $80.94 billion, and average 
earning assets were up 7% to $113.66 billion. 
SunTrust also said "integration planning" is on track for the completion of its $7 billion National Commerce 
Financial Corp. acquisition, set to close in the fourth quarter. 
SunTrust is typically the first major U.S. bank to post results, and its performance is viewed as an indicator of how 
other U.S. banks might fare.

NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI.N), the 8th largest U.S. bank, on Monday said 
second-quarter profit rose 10 percent, helped by growth in lending, asset management and credit card fees, and 
as bad loans fell by more than half. 
The Atlanta-based company, with offices from Maryland to Florida, said net income rose to $364.8 million, or 
$1.29 a share, from $330.4 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7 percent to $1.51 billion. 
Analysts, on average, estimated a profit of $1.26 per share, according to a poll by Reuters Estimates. 
"They benefited from better credit, and fee income was up," said Wayne Bopp, an analyst for Fifth Third 
Investment Advisors in Cincinnati, whose $34 billion of assets includes SunTrust shares. "Expectations for bank 
earnings have been falling a bit lately amid signs the economy may be slowing, so a three-penny beat was nice." 
SunTrust is the first of the 10 largest U.S. banks to report quarterly results. "SunTrust is a leading indicator for 
banks, and the earnings may raise expectations for other banks' results," Bopp said. 
On a conference call, SunTrust Chief Executive L. Phillip Humann said its business lines are doing "very well," 
adding that corporate loan demand appears finally to be rebounding. Profit rose for a third straight quarter. 
"The external environment is a lot more accommodating for banks than it has been," he said. "While we may not 
be seeing much in the way of large corporate loan growth, neither is the lack of volume there hurting us as much 
as it did." 
SunTrust shares rose 75 cents to $65.13 in Monday morning trading. Through Friday, the stock had fallen 10 
percent this year, while the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index declined 3 percent. 
LEADING INDICATOR 
SunTrust expects by November to close its purchase of Memphis, Tennessee-based National Commerce 
Financial Corp. (NCF.N), its first big acquisition since losing a 2001 bidding war for Wachovia Corp. (WB.N) to 
First Union Corp. 
The $7 billion purchase, announced in May, will for the first time put SunTrust in North Carolina and give it access 
to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) locations. 
National Commerce said it has 32 offices in Wal-Marts and planned to add 77 more by 2006. 
Bank of America Corp. (BAC.N) is expected to report on Wednesday, Citigroup Inc. (C.N) and Wachovia on 
Thursday, and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM.N) on July 21. 
SunTrust set aside $38.8 million for bad loans, down 53 percent, and wrote off $37.6 million, down 54 percent. 
Nonperforming assets fell 37 percent to $324.4 million. 
The bank said lending income rose 9 percent from a year earlier to $885.1 million. Noninterest income rose 4 
percent to $622.7 million, including double-digit percentage gains in trust and investment management, retail 
investment services and credit cards. Noninterest expense, such as salaries and equipment, rose 11 percent to 
$928.4 million.

Net interest margin, the difference between what SunTrust earns on loans and pays on deposits, was 3.13 
percent, up from 3.05 percent a year earlier but the same as the first quarter. 
Net loans rose 10 percent to $81.6 billion, deposits rose 11 percent to $85.5 billion and assets rose 6 percent to 
$128.1 billion. 
At March 31, SunTrust had 1,207 banking offices in seven states and the District of Columbia. National 
Commerce had $22.7 billion in assets and nearly 500 branches, mostly in the Southeast.

Head to Head with SunTrust For Third Time in Three Years

Head to Head with SunTrust For Third Time in Three Years

Three years ago SunTrust Banks Inc., desperate to expand into the Carolinas, was engaged in a fierce and 
ultimately futile attempt to lobby Wachovia Corp.'s shareholders to accept it as a buyer, only to see First Union 
Corp. win the prize. 
Five weeks ago SunTrust found its opportunity to spring back with its proposed $7 billion acquisition of National 
Commerce Financial Corp. of Memphis. SunTrust's chief executive, L. Phillip Humann, who had not done a 
sizable transaction since his 1998 acquisition of Crestar Financial Corp., presented the National Commerce deal 
to investors and analysts as making "the best footprint better," boosting SunTrust in Georgia, Tennessee, and 
Virginia and finally opening the door to the Carolinas. 
In almost no time at all Wachovia has returned fire. With its $14 billion deal for SouthTrust Corp. of Birmingham, 
Ala., the Charlotte company would marginally expand its branch networks in Virginia, Tennessee, and North and 
South Carolina -- the states where National Commerce is biggest. Closing the deal would also speed up 
Wachovia's plans to build in Texas. 
And, whether just opportunistically or in a deft bit of flanking, it gives Wachovia a significant boost in SunTrust's 
own backyard, the fast-growing states of Georgia and Florida. 
The competition between the two banks would intensify most notably in Florida, where both have been expanding 
in recent years hoping to tap a growing and affluent population. Wachovia, already second in market share there 
with 15%, would jump to nearly 19%, right behind Bank of America Corp., which has 20%, according to data from 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (the data are as of June 30, 2003). Even after the National Commerce 
purchase, SunTrust would remain at 11%. 
In Georgia, where SunTrust is based, Wachovia would firm its standing as the market leader, with 20% of 
deposits. Even with the addition of National Commerce, SunTrust would remain at about 15% share, the FDIC 
data show. In Virginia, Wachovia remains market leader, with more than 16% share. SunTrust, which already 
trails it in fourth place there, nudges up less than 1%, to 11% share. 
Jefferson Harralson of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. says the Wachovia-SouthTrust deal could have the effect of 
turning SunTrust into an attractive takeover target. 
"It makes the SunTrust franchise even more scarce and valuable," Mr. Harralson said. "SunTrust and SouthTrust 
had the two best franchises in the Southeast for acquirable properties, and now one of those is gone. It highlights 
the value of SunTrust's Florida franchise." 
Other analysts note that the Wachovia merger might create opportunities for SunTrust and other banks to pick up 
customers thrown off during the integration and employees who find themselves squeezed out of a job. 
"In Florida you could argue both sides," said Kevin Fitzsimmons of Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP. "Wachovia will 
be an even stronger competitor" but it will have to shed branches and deposits. "SunTrust has next to no overlap 
with National Commerce" he added. "That may be an opportunity for them to pick up from Wachovia." 
Analysts note that Wachovia is paying a high price: 3.76 times tangible book, but that is not as much as the 4.4 
times book SunTrust agreed to pay in a bidding war with Fifth Third Bancorp to win National Commerce. And,

Page 22 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
analysts note, Wachovia has much more experience with large merger integrations than the current SunTrust 
management. 
"It's been a long time for SunTrust and it's debatable how successful the Crestar deal was," Mr. Fitzsimmons said. 
Meanwhile, First Union's deliberate integration of Wachovia, which has become an industry paradigm "is still fresh 
in everyone's minds and breeds a high confidence level." 
John Pandtle, an analyst at Raymond James Associates, said SunTrust, which has struggled to generate core 
revenue growth amid lackluster markets, may not have found the magic elixir in National Commerce. "At the end 
of the day, I don't think it solves that challenge," Mr. Pandtle said. "What it did do is ensure SunTrust's 
independence for at least two or three years."

Two Banks, Two Stores, One Big Issue: Branding

Two Banks, Two Stores, One Big Issue: Branding

WASHINGTON -- After SunTrust Banks Inc. buys National Commerce Financial Corp. this year, it will be 
competing against itself in markets where National Commerce runs store-based branch networks under different 
brands. 
SunTrust, of Atlanta, has already decided to jettison the National Bank of Commerce brand name on branches in 
Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, as well as the Central Carolina Bank name on National 
Commerce branches in the Carolinas. 
It has decided to retain National Commerce's branding relationship in Georgia and elsewhere with Wal-Mart 
Stores Inc., but SunTrust is still mulling what to do with one other brand operated by the Memphis company in the 
important region of central Virginia. 
National Commerce's growing relationship with Wal-Mart of Bentonville, Ark., includes 20 "Wal-Mart Money 
Center" branches at stores from north of Atlanta through Chattanooga, Tenn. A plan to open 77 branches in new 
and existing Wal-Mart stores in Florida and south Georgia, announced just before SunTrust's $7 billion takeover 
deal, creates the potential for more overlap with SunTrust branches. 
But Nat Commerce also owns 49% of First Market Bank, a joint venture with the Richmond, Va., grocery retailer 
Ukrop's Inc. First Market has 30 branches, including eight stand-alone ones and 22 in Ukrop stores in the 
Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Williamsburg areas. 
SunTrust, which acquired Crestar Financial Corp. of Richmond in 1998, already has the third-largest deposit 
share in Virginia. 
Multibrand strategies are not unheard of in financial services, though having two brands competing side-by-side 
remains rare. 
North Fork Bancorp Inc. of Melville, N.Y., also plans a dual-brand approach after it acquires GreenPoint Financial 
Corp. of New York this summer for $6.3 billion. North Fork would keep GreenPoint's name on branches that serve 
mostly retail customers, but would use the North Fork name on commercial banking-oriented locations. 
Synovus Financial Corp. of Columbus, Ga., uses more than 40 names for its local banks throughout the 
Southeast. Banknorth Group Inc. of Portland, Maine, goes by a half-dozen names in separate markets in New 
England and upstate New York. In those and similar cases, however, brands typically do not overlap in individual 
markets. 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is considering whether to keep the Bank One name for its retail banking operations 
outside the New York region after it buys Bank One Corp. this year. (Texas would be the only area of overlap.) 
The closest analogy to SunTrust's situation may be in Great Britain. Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC has not 
renamed branches of NatWest, which it acquired in 2000, so it competes with itself in many cities and towns, in 
some cases with branches across the street from one another. 
SunTrust and Nat Commerce officials say they are committed to the Wal-Mart strategy, even if it means SunTrust 
would compete with itself.

Page 24 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
When the deal for Nat Commerce was announced last month, L. Phillip Humann, SunTrust's chairman, chief 
executive, and president, told American Banker that the relationship with Wal-Mart was one of Nat Commerce's 
major attractions. 
And that seems to be the way the Tennessee bankers think of them as well. 
The Wal-Mart sites "would be in a very effective, unique retail banking operation, separate from the SunTrust 
brand," William R. Reed Jr., Nat Commerce's chief executive said during a presentation Thursday at the Sanford 
C. Bernstein & Co. 2004 Strategic Decisions Conference in New York. 
National Bank of Commerce and Central Carolina bank customers can use the Wal-Mart branches, though 
executives have said this could change as they increasingly separate the Wal-Mart-branded network from the 
regular bank branches and other in-store ones. 
But SunTrust officials have said less about First Market and Ukrop's, and it is unclear how committed they are to 
that relationship. Barry Koling, a SunTrust spokesman, said it is "looking at all the options," including buying out 
Ukrop's 51% share, selling the 49% stake to Ukrop's, or keeping things as they are now. 
First Market operates as a separate division of Nat Commerce. Customers of National Bank of Commerce and 
Central Carolina Bank can use First Market's automated teller machines but do not have special privileges at the 
branches. 
"We are discussing with Ukrop's what the best course of action is," Mr. Koling said. 
SunTrust is comfortable with the idea of operating more than one brand in a market, he said. "I don't think it's 
conceptually problematic. They could be complementary brands going after different market segments." 
Some experts say a dual branding strategy in certain markets could make sense for SunTrust. 
"Basically, it's like two different channels," said Les Dinkin, the managing principal with NBW Consulting Group 
Inc. of Westport, Conn. 
Nat Commerce's relationship with Wal-Mart is a "channel branding strategy, leveraging the Wal-Mart brand 
name," he said. 
Jefferson Harralson, an Atlanta analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., agreed that separate branding might be 
an advantage, especially in the Wal-Mart case. "You're going after a completely different customer," he said. "The 
Wal-Mart customer is more blue-collar. It seems like an intelligent decision to align with the Wal-Mart brand." 
The First Market situation would be different, since SunTrust would own only a minority stake, he said. "I think 
SunTrust would prefer to change the name," but "the Ukrop's-NCF partnership is such a successful one that 
SunTrust may want to do what it takes to keep the partnership strong." 
SunTrust officials have said they hope to take advantage of Nat Commerce's experience and its approach to 
in-store banking and new branch openings. Mr. Harralson said SunTrust may be unwilling to tinker too much. 
"SunTrust is endeavoring to let the National Commerce retail expertise filter into the SunTrust culture."

Geography, Growth Tipped Auction to SunTrust

CHICAGO -- National Commerce Financial Corp. executives conducted courtships for nearly two months with 
both SunTrust Banks Inc. and Fifth Third Bancorp this spring before agreeing to SunTrust's takeover offer last 
month. 
Not selling also was an option for the Memphis company, but in the end its board was swayed by SunTrust's $7 
billion cash-and-stock offer, the prospect of a higher dividend, and what it saw as better growth prospects, the 
companies said in a securities filing Thursday. 
L. Phillip Humann, SunTrust's chairman, chief executive officer, and president, helped seal the deal with a 
powerful presentation on May 7 that sold National Commerce's board on the benefits of a SunTrust-National 
Commerce combination, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. 
National Commerce executives and board members also may have felt more comfortable selling to another 
southern financial institution rather than to one from Ohio, the person said. 
Thursday's filing described the sequence of events that led to the May 7 agreement and appears to confirm 
speculation that SunTrust outbid Fifth Third in an auction in the days before the deal was announced. 
The filing does not mention Fifth Third by name, but the Cincinnati company had frequently been mentioned in 
recent years as a likely partner for National Commerce. And people familiar with the negotiations have confirmed 
that Fifth Third was the other bidder. 
National Commerce officials also have said they liked SunTrust's growth potential and viewed it as a better fit 
culturally than the other suitor. 
"This was clearly an opportunity for NCF shareholders, in our mind, to step into" a situation where "one and one 
equals more than two," William R. Reed Jr., National Commerce's CEO and president, said during a presentation 
at the Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. 2004 Strategic Decisions Conference in New York on Thursday. 
SunTrust says it was eager to fill geographic holes in its Southeast banking network, namely the Carolinas and 
Memphis. 
"We have said over and over and over again that what we're interested in is geographic expansion only where it 
makes sense from a growth and demographics standpoint," Mr. Humann said during the Sanford C. Bernstein 
presentation. "Getting into the Carolinas [and] completing our franchise in Tennessee clearly fits that." 
According to Thursday's filing, SunTrust, of Atlanta, approached National Commerce first, on March 19, when Mr. 
Humann met Mr. Reed in Memphis to talk over "industry trends and issues, the respective companies' strategic 
directions and the potential benefits" of a deal. 
Not long after that meeting executives from Fifth Third had a similar conversation with Mr. Reed. Those 
conversations set off what eventually became a two-way auction. 
In April both Fifth Third and SunTrust submitted oral bids to National Commerce, which took up the offers with its 
board and began negotiating separately with the two suitors. By the first week of May, SunTrust and Fifth Third

Page 26 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
were conducting due diligence at National Commerce in advance of potential deals, and the negotiations reached 
a peak at the end of that week. 
The negotiations, which involved National Commerce's advisers from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and SunTrust's 
advisers from Goldman, Sachs & Co., came down to even bids from Fifth Third and SunTrust. 
According to the filing, SunTrust's offer was worth $6.9 billion. National Commerce said that was "approximately 
equal in value" to the other offer, so SunTrust came back with the higher offer, worth $7 billion. SunTrust's offer 
also had the added attraction of containing a higher cash component. 
SunTrust also agreed to allow National Commerce to raise its dividend before the deal closes at yearend. 
Thursday's filing says National Commerce's board decided that it was a good time to sell and that SunTrust would 
make the best acquirer. They cited the complementary geographic fit between the companies and SunTrust's 
lower price-to-earnings ratio, which offered a more growth potential and better earnings and book value per share 
than Fifth Third's offer.

CHARLOTTE -- When SunTrust Banks Inc. hangs its sign on branches in the Carolinas next year after acquiring 
National Commerce Financial Corp., L. Phillip Humann, SunTrust's chief executive, would fulfill a long-standing 
ambition to become a significant player in the region. 
However, SunTrust could have a tough time meeting its goal of preserving and building its market share there. 
It would have to compete with a long list of community banks, which are winning business away from large banks 
here and elsewhere, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data. Analysts say the community banks 
stand to benefit most from any disruption when the National Commerce deal closes in the fourth quarter. 
SunTrust, of Atlanta, also would be going up against three of the nation's largest banking companies: Wachovia 
Corp. and Bank of America Corp., both based in Charlotte, and BB&T Corp. of Winston-Salem. Those companies 
have both a home-field advantage and widely recognized brands. And at least two of the three, B of A and 
Wachovia, are trying to attract and retain customers by adding branches, overhauling products, and working to 
improve service. 
In the past few years, according to FDIC figures, the large, locally based banks have been holding steady or even 
gaining deposit share in the states' major metropolitan areas, where National Commerce, of Memphis, has most 
of its branches. 
However, executives at SunTrust and National Commerce say that despite systems changes and the new brand 
name for the branches, they could keep competitors from stealing customers. 
"We're intent not only on keeping them from doing that, but we're intent on growth during this process. We know 
there's a job to be done," said Richard Furr, National Commerce's chief operating officer, who is based in 
Durham, N.C. 
For SunTrust, the $7 billion acquisition would fill a gaping hole in its branch map. 
It had long hoped to buy or merge with the old Wachovia, of Winston-Salem, N.C., to gain a presence in the 
Carolinas. And when First Union Corp. of Charlotte announced a $14.6 billion deal for the old Wachovia in April 
2001, SunTrust fought back with a hostile takeover offer for Wachovia. It lost out to First Union after a 
summer-long proxy fight 
SunTrust did dip its toe into the Carolinas last summer with the purchase of Lighthouse Financial Services Inc., a 
five-branch company in Hilton Head Island, S.C. But it has kept looking for a way to compete along the Interstate 
85 corridor that runs between Raleigh and Atlanta and passes some of the fastest-growing and most 
demographically appealing metropolitan areas in the Southeast. 
"North and South Carolina have been an attractive category for some time, and now we will have a significant 
presence there," Mr. Humann said in an interview May 10, the day after the deal was announced. 
Wachovia, B of A, and BB&T, in that order, rank 1-2-3 in deposits in the two states. The deal for National 
Commerce would put SunTrust in the top 5 in most of the region's major cities.

Page 28 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
D. Anthony Plath, a finance professor and banking expert at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, said 
SunTrust "has a lot of guts" coming into the region. "It's really tough to take business away from those guys." 
A handful of out-of-state banks have bought their way into the Carolinas in recent years, with limited success, he 
said. "This market has never been successfully penetrated by an out-of-state bank." 
National Bank of Commerce of Memphis, merged with the former CCB Financial Corp. of Durham in 2000 to form 
National Commerce, which has since gained deposit share in some areas but slipped in others. In the Carolinas, 
it operates under the brand name Central Carolina Bank. 
SouthTrust Corp. and Regions Financial Corp., both of Birmingham, have acquired banks in the Carolinas in 
recent years, while Royal Bank of Canada entered the U.S. retail banking market in 2001 by purchasing Centura 
Banks Inc. of Rocky Mount to create RBC Centura Banks Inc. 
Mr. Plath said all four of those relative newcomers "are making money, but they're not taking substantial business 
away from the hometown banks." 
Royal Bank of Canada has lost share in many of its markets since 2001, according to FDIC data. And Mr. Plath 
said that even though it has one of the largest branch networks among the newcomers, "I just don't think they've 
had the impact that they thought they'd have." 
For one thing, many Carolinians are loyal to the large, locally based banks, he said. Meanwhile, "the community 
banks that are headquartered here basically build business based on big bank runoffs." 
Jeff Davis, an analyst at First Horizon National Corp.'s FTN Midwest Research in Nashville, said merging banks 
typically lose 5% to 8% of their deposits in a given market as they convert systems, change products, and 
introduce new brand names. In major markets across the Carolinas, that could mean hundreds of millions of 
dollars in deposits up for grabs. 
"My guess is that the beneficiaries are going to be fragmented, but the predominant beneficiaries are again going 
to be the community banks," Mr. Davis said. 
SunTrust and National Commerce are downplaying the notion that customers would flee after the deal closes 
because of disruptions. The two companies say that they would not have to close any branches, and that Nat 
Commerce's would operate with few visible changes, other than the name change. 
"Our customers in these markets will continue to deal with the same people. Decision-making will be in these 
markets, at least to the level we've been doing and maybe more so" under the SunTrust's decentralized model, 
Mr. Furr said. Meanwhile, "we'll have the expanded strength of being with a larger bank," he said. That means 
more products and services for midsize and large companies and wider branch and automated teller machine 
networks for consumers and small businesses.

In Two Deals, Wal-Mart Is Third Party

WASHINGTON -- As two major banking partners of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. prepare to be sold to larger banks, it 
appears unlikely that their plans to add branches in the retail giant's stores over the next two years will be altered. 
In fact, executives at the acquiring banks said the Wal-Mart ties and in-store banking programs of Cleveland's 
Charter One Financial Corp. and National Commerce Financial Corp. of Memphis helped make the deals 
happen. 
Both SunTrust Banks Inc., which is buying National Commerce for $7 billion in cash and stock, and Royal Bank of 
Scotland Group PLC, whose Citizens Financial Corp. is buying Charter One for $10.5 billion in cash, are 
proponents of in-store banking. That they are buying like-minded smaller banks only confirms this commitment. 
The strategy has its share of critics, who have questioned whether the rapid growth of in-store bank branches can 
be sustained. 
But National Commerce's in-store banking expertise, including its relationship with Wal-Mart, "is one of the pieces 
of attraction of this entire thing," SunTrust chairman L. Phillip Humann said in an interview Monday, the day after 
the Nat Commerce deal was announced. 
"We think National Commerce is probably the best retail banking operation in the country, particularly in the 
categories of in-store banking and de novo branching. They will greatly enhance our franchise," said Mr. Humann, 
who is also the Atlanta company's president and chief executive. 
Citizens, of Providence, R.I., will expand its own fledgling relationship with Wal-Mart through Charter One. 
Citizens has two branches inside Wal-Mart stores in New Hampshire, and Charter One plans to add 80 more 
through a deal it announced with the Bentonville, Ark., retailer in March. 
Fred Goodwin, Royal Bank of Scotland's chief executive, told analysts when the deal was announced May 4 that 
Charter One's partnership with Wal-Mart was a "coup" and that there were "further opportunities" with Wal-Mart 
and other store partners. 
"Both Charter One and Citizens have been expanding by opening de novo branches in supermarkets. We're very 
attracted by that model," Mr. Goodwin said. 
Wal-Mart foresees "no impact or change at all" in its relationships with Charter One and National Commerce as a 
result of the acquisitions, spokeswoman Sharon Weber said. 
"We expect it to be business as usual." 
National Commerce, Charter One, and Citizens are among dozens of banks and credit unions that have branches 
in about 900 of Wal-Mart's 3,000 U.S. stores. 
Wal-Mart, which has tried unsuccessfully to obtain a bank charter or buy a bank in recent years, has shifted its 
strategy and is now actively courting banks to set up branches in its stores. "It's our goal to have a bank in every 
new store that we open," Ms. Weber said. "It's a service that our customers appreciate." 
Citizens and SunTrust are already among the top 10 U.S. banks by number of in-store branches.

Page 30 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Wells Fargo & Co., with 675 in-store branches, and Bank of America Corp., with 554, including those of the 
former FleetBoston, which it acquired April 1, have the top two in-store banking networks among U.S. banks, 
according to National Commerce Bank Services, a National Commerce subsidiary that advises banks on in-store 
strategy. 
Citizens and Charter One would have the third-largest in-store bank network, with 418 branches (258 from 
Citizens and 160 from Charter One). And Charter One is continuing to expand through relationships with 
Wal-Mart and other retailers. 
National Commerce and SunTrust would rank No. 4 with 342 in-store branches -- 187 from National Commerce 
and 155 from SunTrust. 
National Commerce has been a pioneer of in-store banking since the mid-1980s and now has two separate, but 
related, deals with Wal-Mart. It is conducting a closely watched pilot in north Georgia that has converted 20 
branches to the name Wal-Mart Money Center and could expand to 32 stores over the next two years. 
And last month National Commerce signed a deal to open 77 National Bank of Commerce branches (the brand it 
uses in Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia) at new Wal-Marts in Georgia and Florida. 
National Commerce officials said that if the Georgia pilot succeeds, they will adopt the Wal-Mart Money Center 
name in the additional branches as well. "If the test doesn't work, we'll go back to another brand," said William R. 
Reed, National Commerce's CEO, at a banking conference in New York Tuesday sponsored by UBS. 
"The whole idea here is to test if we put Wal-Mart on the label, would it cause more activity, more inquiries 
because the shoppers would assume the value was going to be better," Mr. Reed said. "In other words, the value 
proposition of Wal-Mart would transcend into banking." 
"So far, it's done just that," he said. "The growth rate has accelerated after we put the brand up." 
Wal-Mart's Ms. Weber said that because the test is continuing she would rather not talk about it. 
Charter One, meanwhile, has been adding branches in Starbucks shops, Kroger Inc. grocery stores, and 
elsewhere under an ambitious program that tries to piggyback on the retailers' growth strategies. 
"When is the last time you heard Target or Wal-Mart say, 'You know, I don't think we're going to open any stores 
this year,' " said Mark D. Grossi, Charter One's chief retail officer, at a branch banking symposium last week in 
Chicago. (The symposium was sponsored by Thomson Media, which publishes American Banker.) 
Mr. Grossi says banks have to cater to all customers, not just certain segments, if they are to sell effectively 
through their branches. "Don't deny you're in the mass-market business -- you are," he said. (Mr. Grossi is to 
leave Charter One when the Citizens deal closes. See story on this page.) 
Analysts say it remains to be seen whether banks can maintain a long-term profitable relationship with Wal-Mart, 
which is known to lean heavily on suppliers to cut prices. 
"In terms of the Wal-Mart strategy, the jury's out," said Jennifer Thompson of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. 
"Other banks have had mixed results. The early indication is that the Wal-Mart strategy is quite profitable for 
National Commerce, but these are the early innings." 
Mr. Reed acknowledged that the business model for National Commerce's Wal-Mart locations trades some profits 
for higher volumes.

ATLANTA -- SunTrust Banks Inc. says administrative positions could be affected but it doesn't expect significant 
job cuts from the nearly $7 billion (U.S.) purchase of National Commerce Financial Corp. 
Shares of both banking companies fell yesterday on news of the cash and stock deal, which is worth almost $10 
billion (Canadian) at yesterday's exchange rate. 
The agreement, announced Sunday, would make SunTrust the seventh-largest bank in the United States with 
$148 billion (U.S.) in assets and $97 billion in deposits. 
SunTrust spokesperson Barry Koling said job cuts will be made among the companies' 33,000 employees, mostly 
in back-office functions, such as administrative and operational positions. Specifics are still being worked out, but 
Koling indicated the number won't be significant. 
"I don't think we're talking thousands," he said. 
Jeff K. Davis, an analyst with FTN Midwest Research in Nashville, said he expects NCF's offices in Memphis, 
Tenn., and Durham, N.C., to be hit particularly hard. 
"There will be expense reductions that will mostly be born by National Commerce," Davis said. "How many folks 
that will be, who knows?" 
Management changes are expected as well, but executives at Atlanta-based SunTrust and NCF, based in 
Memphis, would not go into details during a conference call with analysts yesterday. The companies said Sunday 
no branch-based job eliminations will result from any branch consolidations. 
NCF president and chief executive William Reed Jr. will be a member of SunTrust's policy and management 
committees, but beyond that his exact role at the merged company has not been determined, said SunTrust 
chairman and chief executive Phillip Humann. Four NCF board members will join SunTrust's board, Humann 
said. 
Shares of SunTrust fell $5.08, or 7.6 per cent, to close at $61.80 on the New York Stock Exchange, where shares 
of National Commerce Financial fell 70 cents to $31.10. 
Humann said the deal, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, would expand SunTrust's reach 
in the South and provide strong growth potential, especially in the supermarket and retail-store segment, where 
NCF specializes in in-store automated banking machines and banking centres. 
The combined bank will operate as SunTrust. 
"If we didn't have the best footprint in banking before, I think you could make the case that we do now," Humann 
said. 
SunTrust won't sell any of the 48.3 million Coca-Cola Co. shares held at the end of March to help finance the 
purchase, Humann said. SunTrust took Coca-Cola public in 1919 and the safe-deposit vault at the bank's main 
office in Atlanta contains the only written copy of the Coca-Cola formula, according to the bank's Web site.

NCF is the holding company for the National Bank of Commerce, Central Carolina Bank & Trust and NBC Bank. 
NCF operates in Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia, Virginia and West 
Virginia. 
The National Bank of Commerce has had branches in Wal-Mart stores since 1991. In a two-year test program 
begun last fall, some branches in Georgia and Tennessee have been operating under the name Wal-Mart Money 
Centers. 
SunTrust operates in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia and the District of Columbia. 
Later this week, customers will be able to use ATMs of either bank without a usage fee. 
The merger follows a string of combinations in the national and regional banking business. Bank of America Corp. 
recently completed its $47 billion acquisition of FleetBoston Financial Corp., and the proposed $58 billion merger 
of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank One Corp. is pending. 
In January, Regions Financial Corp. and Union Planters Corp. agreed to merge in a $6 billion deal that creates a 
southeastern banking powerhouse. The same month, Huntington Bancshares Inc. announced plans to acquire 
Unizan Financial Corp. in a stock deal the two companies valued at $587 million. 
Analyst Davis said the NCF deal will help SunTrust round out its southern geographic base.

BANK MERGER COULD AFFECT JOBS IN AREA

A merger of two of the largest banks in the Roanoke Valley could affect local jobs, but the extent is unknown. 
SunTrust Banks Inc. announced Sunday its nearly $7 billion takeover of National Commerce Financial Corp., the 
Memphis, Tenn.- based parent company of National Bank of Commerce, Central Carolina Bank & Trust and NBC 
Bank. 
The merger will make SunTrust the seventh-largest bank in the United States and help it expand its presence in 
North Carolina and in Tennessee, bank officials said Monday during a conference call. 
In the Roanoke Valley, the merger will draw SunTrust closer to Wachovia, which has the largest market share 
among banks in the Roanoke metropolitan area. As of June 2003, Wachovia had 26.9 percent of total market 
share, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. SunTrust had 13.2 percent and National Bank of 
Commerce had 11 percent, according to the FDIC. 
SunTrust plans to save $117 million, primarily by consolidating administrative and back-office jobs. Barry Koling, 
spokesman for Atlanta-based SunTrust, said the cuts would not include branch- based positions and the majority 
would occur through attrition. 
Neither company offered details about the kinds of operations they have that may be duplicated in the Roanoke 
region. 
Koling said it is "too soon to speculate" about what jobs may be lost in the Roanoke Valley. 
Koling also said it is too soon to discuss details about the changeover of NBC branches to SunTrust locations. 
There are 13 SunTrust branches in the Roanoke Valley and 20 NBC branches, according to bank spokeswomen. 
Sheri Minnix, SunTrust vice president and regional marketing officer for Western Virginia, said she did not know 
the exact number of SunTrust employees in the region, but she said the figure is significantly more than 200. 
There are 136 NBC employees in the Roanoke Valley, said Eileen Sarro, spokeswoman for that bank. 
"One thing that we will say about the branches is that we are very confident that everyone will have a job," Sarro 
said. 
She said NBC customers will begin receiving letters this week about the merger. This week they also can begin 
using SunTrust ATMs without facing extra charges. 
Cities that house a bank's call center often are most at risk for losing administrative jobs through a merger, said 
David Wagstaff, managing director at FI-Performance Consulting, a bank consulting firm in Pennsylvania. 
Because there are no call centers for NBC or SunTrust in the Roanoke Valley, Wagstaff said the "employment 
impact could be low." 
He added that in a merger, often the bank being bought is affected the most because it must deal with system 
conversion and employee training. 
But smaller, community banks may see gains when large banks merge. 
Past bank mergers have helped Roanoke-based Valley Bank win new customers, often because customers' 
contacts with the merged banks change, said Ellis Gutshall, president and chief executive officer of Valley Bank.

"When you knock on their door, they're more willing to listen," he said. 
"We compete every day with SunTrust and NBC head-on," he continued. "They're good, and they've been good. 
We'll have to work a little harder to compete as they get bigger." 
The banking community in Roanoke has experienced several mergers over the years. In 2001, Wachovia and 
First Union merged. Roanoke's Dominion Bankshares and First Union merged in 1993. About 1,200 local jobs 
were cut during that merger. 
National and local SunTrust executives, along with NCF officials, consider the merger positive for growth in the 
Southeast. 
"We're thrilled about it," Minnix said. 
"If we don't already have the best footprint in banking, you can make the case that we do now," said Phillip 
Humann, SunTrust chairman and chief executive, during a conference call. Humann referred to SunTrust's 
concentration in the Southeast, and NCF's strength in retail operations, including stores such as Wal-Mart. 
Bank customers can prepare for mergers, Wagstaff said. 
He said they should check accounts regularly for errors and keep track of all transactions. 
NCF operates in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia, Virginia and West 
Virginia. SunTrust operates in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia and the District of Columbia.

* A $6.98-billion deal for National Commerce Financial Corp. is the latest on a long list of recent takeovers. 
* * * 
SunTrust Banks has agreed to buy the National Commerce Financial Corp. in a cash and stock deal worth $6.98 
billion, continuing a consolidation trend in the banking industry. 
The purchase, if approved by regulators, would make SunTrust, which is based in Atlanta, the nation's 
seventh-largest bank. National Commerce, based in Memphis, Tenn., has about $23 billion in assets and runs 
about 500 banks in 14 Southeastern states. 
"National Commerce, with its great franchise, talented people and high standards, is a superb fit for SunTrust," L. 
Phillip Humann, the chairman and chief executive officer of SunTrust, said in a statement when the deal was 
announced. 
The transaction is valued at $33.46 for each share of National Commerce stock. Yesterday, shares of SunTrust 
fell $5.08, or 7.6 percent, to close at $61.80 on the New York Stock Exchange, where shares of National 
Commerce Financial fell 70 cents to $31.10. 
Under the agreement, National Commerce shareholders could elect to receive either cash or SunTrust stock, the 
companies said. SunTrust said the deal involved $1.8 billion in cash and 77.5 million shares of company stock. 
National Commerce is the holding company for National Bank of Commerce, Central Carolina Bank &Trust and 
NBC Bank. It operates in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia, Virginia 
and West Virginia. 
National Bank of Commerce has had branches in Wal-Mart stores since 1991. In a two-year test program started 
last fall, some branches in Georgia and Tennessee have been operating under the name Wal-Mart Money 
Centers. 
SunTrust operates in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia and the District of Columbia. 
SunTrust spokesman Barry Koling said yesterday that there will be job cuts among the companies' 33,000 
employees, mostly in back- office functions, such as administrative and operational positions. 
Specifics are still being worked out, but Koling indicated the number won't be significant. 
"I don't think we're talking thousands," he said. 
Jeff K. Davis, an analyst with FTN Midwest Research in Nashville, said he expects National Commerce's offices 
in Memphis and Durham, N.C., to be hit particularly hard. 
"There will be expense reductions that will mostly be born by National Commerce," Davis said. "How many folks 
that will be, who knows?" 
Management changes are expected as well, but executives at both companies would not go into details during a 
conference call with analysts yesterday. The companies said Sunday that no branch-based job eliminations will 
result from any branch consolidations.

National Commerce president and chief executive officer William R. Reed Jr. will be a member of SunTrust's 
policy and management committees, but beyond that, his exact role at the merged company has not been 
determined, said Humann. Four National Commerce board members will join SunTrust's board, Humann said. 
Humann said the deal, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, would expand SunTrust's reach 
in the South and provide strong growth potential, especially in the supermarket and retail store segment, where 
National Commerce specializes with in- store ATM machines and banking centers. The combined bank will 
operate as SunTrust. 
"If we didn't have the best footprint in banking before, I think you could make the case that we do now," Humann 
said. 
Later this week, customers will be able to use ATMs of either bank without a usage fee. 
The merger follows a string of combinations in the national and regional banking business. Bank of America Corp. 
recently completed its $47-billion acquisition of FleetBoston Financial Corp., and the proposed $58-billion merger 
of J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. and Bank One Corp. is pending. 
In January, Regions Financial Corp. and Union Planters Corp. agreed to merge in a $6-billion deal that creates a 
Southeastern banking powerhouse. 
Humann said Sunday that he has been told for three years that his bank is an acquisition target. By agreeing to 
buy National Commerce, Humann said the bank can stay independent. 
"Our intention is to integrate this transaction, ramp up our growth and ensure our independence -- forever," 
Humann, 58, said. 
Blaylock &Partners analysts Michael Plodwick and Richard Caddell cited SunTrust as a possible takeover 
candidate last week, after Providence-based Citizens Financial Group Inc., on behalf of its parent Royal Bank of 
Scotland PLC, agreed to buy Charter One Financial Inc. for $10.5 billion. 
Davis, the analyst, said the deal makes sense for SunTrust because it helps the company round out its 
geographic base in the South. At the same time, he said he was surprised National Commerce decided to sell out 
before expanding its presence in Wal-Mart stores and in the Atlanta market. 
"We're scratching our heads saying, 'Why now?' " Davis said. 
The acquisition of National Commerce would be the biggest for SunTrust since it agreed to buy Crestar Financial 
for $9.5 billion in July 1998. That deal put SunTrust into the Virginia-Washington, D.C., market. 
Three years later, SunTrust tried a bigger move - a merger with Wachovia. Instead, Wachovia agreed to a deal 
with First Union, and the two North Carolina banks combined to create the current Wachovia.

SunTrust hitches ride with Wal-Mart National Commerce deal sweetened by bank's locations in world's 
biggest retailer.

Think of the latest banking merger as SunTrust-meets-Wal-Mart. 
Sure, the silk-stocking Atlanta bank will branch into some demographically appealing markets, such as Charlotte 
and Memphis. But it also will latch onto the agreeable, fast-expanding partnership that National Commerce 
Financial has with Wal-Mart. 
The cachet of the world's biggest retailer is such that National Commerce plugs its outlets in Wal-Mart locations 
using the Wal-Mart name first, as in "Wal-Mart Money Centers by National Bank of Commerce." 
The Wal-Mart part of the name is a keeper, SunTrust Chairman L. Phillip Humann told analysts Monday, one day 
after announcing a nearly $7 billion deal to buy Memphis-based National Commerce. 
"I think it's a key way for [SunTrust Banks] to grow," said banking analyst Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners in 
Atlanta. 
While the Wal-Mart link is important, he noted, SunTrust executives spent Monday discussing other key issues as 
well. One was the fact the deal closes what Marinac thinks is the last hole in the Southeast for SunTrust: North 
Carolina. 
Another was the price, an above-average 18.3 times National Commerce's estimated earning per share this year. 
SunTrust's plan to issue stock to help pay for the deal means the interests of existing stockholders will be diluted. 
That apparently contributed to Monday's slump in SunTrust shares. 
The stock dropped $5.08, or about 8 percent, to $61.80, while National Commerce shares lost 70 cents to $31.10. 
Monday's market slump and a malaise among bank stocks also affected the shares, said analyst Marinac. 
Beyond the market's immediate reaction, however, there is much for SunTrust to bank on --- particularly with 
Wal-Mart. Last month, National Commerce agreed to open 70 bank offices in Wal-Mart stores in Georgia and 
Florida. That's in addition to the 20 Wal-Mart branches already in Tennessee and North Georgia. 
SunTrust found National Commerce's Wal-Mart strategy "particularly attractive," SunTrust spokesman Barry 
Koling said Monday. "What they think about Wal-Mart, we think about Wal-Mart." 
Which may have been why Chief Executive William Reed Jr. of National Commerce told analysts the deal with 
SunTrust could lead to a "more aggressive" relationship with Wal-Mart. 
The rationale is obvious: More bodies move through a Wal-Mart store than a traditional bank branch, so there's 
more opportunity for business. National Commerce, a pioneer is placing bank branches in grocery stores and 
other outlets, has found deposits can pile up faster at Wal-Mart locations than at regular branches. 
"It has been phenomenal," said Eileen Sarro, a spokeswoman for National Commerce.

Page 40 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The Wal-Mart locations even mimic the retailer's everyday low-price strategy. That means lower service fees and 
sometimes higher deposit rates than competitors, including National Commerce branches in the same area, Sarro 
said. 
The deal with National Commerce will not affect SunTrust's Publix locations, spokesman Koling said. 
Wal-Mart has deals with numerous banks, so there's no chance one bank is going to gain a national presence 
through the retailer, Wal-Mart spokeswoman Sharon Weber noted on Monday. 
However, there's still a lot of growth potential, even if it's limited by geography. 
"We'd like to have a bank in every new store," Weber said. Map WHERE ARE THEY?

If SunTrust Banks didn't have the best overall coverage in the Southeast before the National Commerce deal, it 
does now, SunTrust Chairman L. Phillip Humann said Monday. By acquiring National Commerce, SunTrust will 
get into North Carolina for the first time and add attractive markets in South Carolina and Tennessee.

ATLANTA (AP) - SunTrust Banks Inc. said administrative positions could be affected but it doesn't expect 
significant job cuts from its nearly $7 billion purchase of National Commerce Financial Corp., which is known for 
its outlets in supermarkets and retail stores. 
Shares of both banking companies fell Monday on news of the cash and stock deal.

Deal Settles Near-Term Questions For SunTrust

Deal Settles Near-Term Questions For SunTrust

A deal for National Commerce Financial Corp. may quell speculation that SunTrust Banks Inc. cannot survive 
another wave of big bank acquisitions, but analysts said Monday that its long-term fate still rests on returning to 
solid earnings growth. 
The $7 billion deal, announced Sunday afternoon, came three years after SunTrust's failed attempt to buy the old 
Wachovia Corp. of Winston-Salem, N.C. 
Ever since losing a summer-long shareholder battle to First Union Corp. of Charlotte, the $125 billion-asset 
Atlanta company has been haunted by investor worries that it lacked a coherent growth strategy and could find 
itself a takeover target. 
On Monday, SunTrust's chairman, president, and chief executive, L. Phillip Humann, said the National 
Commerce deal put to rest lingering questions about his company's future. 
"Our story is very clear," he said in an interview. "Successfully executing this merger will absolutely ensure our 
independence." 
Buying the $23 billion-asset National Commerce would not be the transformational deal Mr. Humann was looking 
for three years ago. But like Wachovia, National Commerce would bolster SunTrust by filling gaps in its 
southeastern branch network, including Memphis, where National Commerce is based, and the Carolinas, where 
it has only a few branches. 
SunTrust emerged as the winner of a bidding war that reportedly included Fifth Third Bancorp of Cincinnati. 
On Monday many analysts agreed with Mr. Humann, though some say SunTrust's name will resurface in 
takeover rumors, especially if the acquisition does not succeed. 
"This answers the question of what happens to SunTrust, in the near term, at least," said Jennifer Thompson, an 
analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. "Now that they've done this deal, it makes them much less likely to be seen as 
a takeover target, for at least a year and a half." 
That's how long SunTrust would be integrating National Commerce's operations, and "a potential acquirer is not 
going to want to do a double integration," she said. 
But once that integration is done, SunTrust may be even more attractive to a potential acquirer, especially a 
larger bank from elsewhere that wants to expand into the Southeast. From a long-term perspective, "I don't think 
anything's changed," Ms. Thompson said. 
Jeff Davis, an analyst at First Horizon National Corp.'s FTN Midwest Research in Nashville, said SunTrust's name 
should be "off the table for the time being." It is no longer "a legitimate takeout candidate, unless they stub their 
toe." 
Other veteran analysts, who previously have frowned at speculation that SunTrust is a target, said Sunday's deal 
confirms that it is clearly a buyer, not a seller.

Page 46 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"I've never been one to believe that they would sell out anytime in the near future, and this doesn't change that," 
said Nancy Bush, an independent analyst with NAB Research LLC in Annandale, N.J. 
On Monday, Mr. Humann's pitch to investors was that the deal would help SunTrust keep growing and adapting. 
National Commerce has been growing more quickly than SunTrust in some key measures, and Mr. Humann said 
he hopes his company can learn from it. Nat Commerce's net interest income, for example, grew 7.7% in the first 
quarter, more than double the rate at SunTrust. Loans and noninterest-bearing deposits also have grown more 
quickly at Nat Commerce. Beyond the new markets, the deal could help SunTrust improve its growth through 
in-store banking and branch-building, he said. "We think National Commerce is probably the best retail banking 
operation in the country, particularly in the categories of in-store banking and de novo branching."

SunTrust Banks said Sunday that it will acquire National Commerce Financial for about $7 billion, a union that 
will create the USA's seventh-largest bank. 
The deal pairs two regional banks, each with a strong presence in the Southeast. Together, Atlanta-based 
SunTrust and Memphis-based National Commerce will rank No. 3 in market share in the Southeast, with $148 
billion in assets, $97 billion in deposits and 1,723 branches in 11 states and the District of Columbia. National 
Commerce brands include National Bank of Commerce and Central Carolina Bank. 
"Our companies complement each other perfectly in terms of customer focus, geographic coverage and business 
orientation," SunTrust CEO L. Phillip Humann said in a statement. 
The deal continues a trend of banking consolidation. Last week, the Royal Bank of Scotland said it will acquire 
Charter One Financial, based in Cleveland, for $10.5 billion. In April, Bank of America and FleetBoston Financial 
combined to become the USA's third- biggest banking corporation. The merger of J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank 
One, announced in January, will create the USA's second- largest bank. 
Under the terms of the deal, SunTrust will pay about $1.8 billion in cash and 77.5 million SunTrust shares. Based 
on the price of SunTrust shares at the close of business Friday, the transaction is valued at $33.46 per National 
Commerce share. 
National Commerce shareholders will receive the equivalent of $8.625 plus 0.3713 SunTrust shares for each NCF 
share. 
National Commerce's stock has jumped in recent days on speculation that it would be acquired. Richard Bove, 
banking industry analyst for Hoefer & Arnett, said in a report released before Sunday's announcement that 
National Commerce was a natural merger candidate because "it was expanding too rapidly and taking too many 
risks with its balance sheet." 
The new company will operate as SunTrust. Humann will continue as chairman and CEO after the merger. The 
combined bank will add four directors from National Commerce to SunTrust's existing 14-member board. 
SunTrust said that after the merger, it expects to reduce annual operating expenses by about $117 million. About 
60% would be realized in 2005. 
The savings will come primarily from consolidating back office and administrative functions, SunTrust said. There 
will be no branch- based job cuts because of limited geographic overlap. The banks said they anticipate most 
other job eliminations will come from normal attrition. 
The merger, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, is expected to close by year's end.

With that, let me turn it over to Phil Humann. 
PHIL HUMANN, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT & CEO, SUNTRUST: Thanks Gary. Good morning everybody. We 
appreciate your calling in and apologize to you because I know we interrupted somebody's Mother's Day activities 
when we made our press release yesterday. 
If you have had a chance to review our presentation it may be increasingly apparent to you what is abundantly 
clear to us -- that the partnership between SunTrust and National Commerce is one that has great potential and 
great promise. But let me state right up front this is not about size. From a SunTrust perspective we've long said 
that we like mergers that either let us expand geographically into markets with strong demographics and high 
growth characteristics or that enhance our business capabilities. This merger is of the best of both. 
First of all, with respect to geographic expansion, it fills out our franchise in Tennessee, adding the important 
Memphis market with additional presence throughout almost all of the rest of the state. Just as importantly it adds 
North and South Carolina, markets that we of long said fit our demographics and growth characteristics. But the 
merger also enhances our business capabilities, particularly in sub-segments of the retail operation where we 
think National Commerce is the nation's leader in things like in-store banking and de novo branching. From the 
SunTrust side we will talk about what we bring to the table with particular strengths in the larger end of 
commercial and wealth management that we will be able to make available to National Commerce customers. 
You should all know that all of us in this room and a lot of people in both organizations who are not in this room 
are focused 100 percent on translating the potential and the promise of this merger into the kind of tangible 
results that not only meet our high standards, but yours as well. 
Now we want to get right into the presentation, but first I would like to do two things. I know a lot of National 
Commerce people are on the call, and I just want to say a hearty welcome to SunTrust. We've long respected

Page 49 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
your company and we're delighted to have you on our team. I'm well aware that the kind of growth and 
performance for which National Commerce is known, and frankly that made us keen to join forces with you, 
doesn't just happened; it is the result of talented people with and entrepreneurial spirit, who know what they're 
doing and do it well. I think you'll find we look at the world the same way and I know we're going to do great things 
together. 
Secondly, one of the biggest pluses of this deal from my perspective is that we finally get Bill Reed on our side. 
Bill, do you want to say a word? 
BILL REED, PRESIDENT & CEO, NATIONAL COMMERCE: I don't know if that's the most important part of the 
transaction, but I appreciate the complement. 
The Annual Report last year of SunTrust, I think the headline was "Why SunTrust?" and that is probably what a 
lot of people in our company and maybe people that own our company and follow it are asking today. But the 
question is an easy one to answer. It started really about 40 years ago when Bruce Campbell joined National 
Bank of Commerce coming out of the SunTrust -- the Trust Company back then -- of Atlanta. And as a result of 
that early plant in our marketplace, I can tell you the DNA of NCF has a little bit of genetic SunTrust in it. And I 
think you can see it very quickly in the credit quality trends of the two companies over that 40 year period. Bruce 
Campbell brought that to us and it never left us, and it's a hallmark today. 
Additionally we've been customers of each others for many years. From a correspondent banking and over line 
(ph) standpoint, SunTrust was always our first partner to call whenever we had a need in that area. When it came 
to in-store consulting, we were hired by SunTrust in the mid '90s to help them with their roll-out here at Publix and 
as a result got to know them a lot more from a retail standpoint. 
So we have long and enduring relationship, a lot of mutual respect. We're from the same part of the world. We've 
competed against each other for many years. We respect the talent in this company from a competitive 
standpoint, and when we lost to SunTrust it was always a good loss; it was a hard fight and a good lost when we 
went after a particular customer. So we know what is here and we appreciate what's here and we're looking 
forward to being on the team. 
We know we will continue with our priorities, which are similar in many ways. Revenue growth to us is critical. 
That's the margin and the fees. Credit quality is already here. Efficiency of the operations is important to us. And 
we think the de novo aspects of our operation are extremely unique. We know how to go with businesses in new 
places in a very efficient way and help grow the revenue stream with not a lot of extra shares issued. So we're 
excited, and we know each other well and we're looking forward to this being a great partnership in going forward. 
PHIL HUMANN: Thanks Bill and welcome aboard. Let's begin the presentation (technical difficulty) quick 
overview of (technical difficulty) three and four, which are sort of the transaction summary. Implied consideration 
of $33.46; a stock cash election to allow shareholders a choice, which will result due to proration in the 
transaction having about 74 percent stock and 26 percent cash. The implied aggregate value is slightly south of 
$7 billion. The components are 77.5 million SunTrust shares plus 1.8 billion in cash. Obviously a tax-free 
reorganization with respect to the stock component, with the cash component being taxed at the capital gains 
rate, and obviously we used purchase accounting. 
On page four there are no walk away capture collars in the transaction, a $280 million termination fee. We're 
absolutely delighted that four National Commerce Directors will join the SunTrust Board. The due diligence 
obviously has been completed, and we need to seek regulatory and shareholder approvals. But we expect a 
closing sometime during the fourth quarter. 
If you turn to page five, there are really four key messages we hope you'll come away with and that I believe will 
be supported by the material we're going to show you this morning. 
We talked in our press release about a high-growth franchise. If we didn't already have the best footprint in 
banking, I think you could make the case convincingly that we do now. We're concentrated in the rapidly growing 
and demographically attractive Southeast. We've got the highest growth footprint among the top 20 banks. And 
from a top SunTrust perspective this transaction gives us entry into five new high-growth markets, including 
Memphis, Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham and others. 
But in addition to the geography, our business models our complementary. I've already said we think that National 
Commerce is probably the best retail operator in the country, particularly with respect to de novo branching and 
in-store expertise that both Bill and I have already mentioned. In terms of broader products and client resources 
there's opportunity on both sides -- improved commercial penetration in both National Commerce and SunTrust

Page 50 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
markets, where we can leverage respective strengths at different ends of the market, SunTrust being at the 
higher end and National Commerce at the lower end; also in wealth management, where we've beefed up our 
capabilities in recent years. 
When you view these business opportunities in context of our high-growth geographic footprint and these two 
companies that are already on strong individual growth trajectories, you wind up with a combined operation with 
unparalleled growth prospects. SunTrust put margin pressure behind us two or three quarters ago. We turned the 
corner on revenue growth. We had a good first quarter and good performance trends in general. National 
Commerce's capabilities and expertise demonstrated very much in growth, actually better than SunTrust. Plus 
we've identified significant business synergies on a highly conservative basis. All that adds up to a financial profile 
for this deal that is very attractive. 
Indeed, this is where we think the word incomparable, which we use in the title of our presentation today to 
describe the combined franchise, maybe most applicable. Given the unique high-growth dimensions of this 
merger, our geographic footprint, National Commerce's track record and SunTrust's recent momentum, we don't 
think there are truly comparable transactions out there. Those of you who follow us closely know that we don't like 
to over-promise when it comes to financial performance; we prefer to let results speak for themselves. But you will 
see the assumptions we use are extremely conservative and we feel that the targets we're talking about today are 
therefore highly achievable. 
If you will move on to page six, entitled "Compelling Strategic Combination", let me walk through it very quickly. 
As I've already said we believe that SunTrust already has the best footprint in banking, and when you add the 
high-growth MSAs I've referenced and minimal overlap, the best footprint in banking just got better. SunTrust 
brings large corporate and middle market capabilities, along with cash management and a whole variety of wealth 
management services, both on the personal and institutional side, heavy capabilities and investment banking and 
brokerage, along with mortgage and an already large retail franchise. National Commerce, as I've already said, 
are the national leaders in retail banking, very strong small-business, commercial real estate and mortgage, the 
result being that the expanded product offering that's going to be overlaid across the expanded customer base 
and distribution systems will result in a higher growth rate for the combined company. Finally, SunTrust already 
has established leadership positions in high-growth markets, abundant capital resources. You combine that with 
the de novo growth strategy, the entrepreneurial high-growth revenue base culture at National Commerce plus 
their extreme focus on efficiency, it can do nothing but enhance our overall growth rate. 
If you turn to page seven, it's simply a map showing the combined geographies. The combined company will have 
almost 148 billion in assets, with 1,700 full-service offices now running fully from Maryland all the way to south 
Florida. As I've said, we will gain a top 5 rank in 20 of the 25 largest high-growth markets in the Southeast, 
particularly adding, as I said, in North and South Carolina and enhancing our position in Virginia and Tennessee. 
Page eight drills down a little further into these high-growth markets. You'll see the arrows on the left-hand side 
indicating where the overlap and what represents new markets for SunTrust. We overlap to some degree in 
Atlanta, Nashville and Knoxville. But the new markets I referred to include Raleigh-Durham, Charlotte-Gastonia, 
Greensboro, Highpoint, Winston-Salem, in addition to the Memphis market. I won't go through the metrics there, 
but you can see it represents the fastest-growing Southeastern MSAs with greater than 5 billion in deposits. 
Page nine is simply a charted update to reflect National Commerce that shows that SunTrust still maintains the 
highest growth footprint in the country, and arguably the best footprint in banking with growth rates expected 
considerably above the national average and several times that of some of our peers noted on the right hand side 
of the page. 
In terms of market expansion, as I said, we add some of the highest growth North and South Carolina markets 
and solidify and enhance our presence in Virginia and Tennessee. The pie chart on the left shows that we have 
about 19 or 20 percent overlapping markets, and from a SunTrust perspective 80 percent new markets with those 
outlined with some detail at the bottom. 
Now I'm going to turn it back over to Bill Reed to talk more about the National Commerce franchise. 
BILL REED: My comments will really be to individuals on the call that may not be familiar with NCF. I will try to 
give you a quick highlight and overview of the company, but after the call if you have any questions great. And 
even more importantly, you might go back and look at some of our recent press releases to understand our 
numbers and our business even in better detail. It's hard to tell the story in a couple of slides, but I'm going to do 
that quickly.

Page 51 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
From an overview standpoint, you can see the trends in our loans, deposits and assets. I should point out that in 
2003 we had a securitization of about 770 million in loans, and if you would have included that back in the 
numbers the growth rate would be much higher on the loan side. Additionally, these are NCF deposits that do not 
include our joint venture with the First Market Bank in Richmond, which is another $1 billion in total assets, a little 
over $620 million in loans and about $900 billion in deposits. That is a partnership with the Ukrops grocery chain 
in Richmond and is a subsidiary at this point that we show only in the investment line. 
The GAAP numbers are there in terms of trends on net income -- efficiency ratio and returns. And again, if you 
look at our information on the company you'll see we have a high cash component to add back to that. So these 
are basically slightly understated in terms of performance, but still are very good. 
If you were to look at the loan growth over the last year, Q1 '03 to Q1 '04, we're up 13.5 percent. And if you were 
to look at our cash efficiency ratio in the first quarter it would have been in the low 48 percent range. Again, the 
cash component does make a material impact. 
On the right hand side, the asset quality over the last five quarters, you can see that historically we're in that 25 to 
30 basis point range. We did have an aircraft portfolio issued last year and we dealt with it. That's behind us. And 
we're comfortable that we will be in that 25 to 30 basis point range going forward. The loan mix, deposit mix and 
business mix are shown there at the bottom. We do have a very nice loan mix which allows us have a little bit 
higher yield sometimes than our peers, with a heavy focus on the retail mortgage products in our company, and of 
course the small to medium middle market companies on the commercial side. 
On page 12, the retail model that we operate today has a lot of nuances in it which we think makes us tactically a 
little bit more flexible to take advantage of opportunities in all the markets we're in. We do have a customized 
pricing strategy that's based on the market opportunities and the market maturity. We know we're very good at 
the in-store de novo strategy, and we're very good about going into a new market where we have never been with 
the novo expertise on both stores and the hubs and operate what we call the hub and spoke concept with the 
more traditional hubs, coupled with some good spokes that are predominantly in the number one leading grocery 
chain in the cities we enter. 
The exciting thing to us is if you look at the huge SunTrust franchise, and if we can just figure out how to transfer 
some of the things that we might be in that best practice area over into that franchise, I think the upside is 
gigantic. SunTrust is already an outstanding retail bank. We think we have some minor adjustments to some of 
the products and maybe some of the promotions that could help us go to a higher level. But it's an incredible 
footprint. There are a lot of households, and if we can figure out how to serve them just a little bit more I think it 
will have a significant impact on the growth rate of the company. 
How do we do de novo? For the folks that do know the story, page 13 gives you just a quick insight. The good 
thing about entering with a hub and spoke concept is the cost -- the entry is very low. We look at it as a 
distribution model, with manufacturing occurring at the home office. And when you put the manufacturing 
concentration in one area, you don't export those costs as you go into a new area, and what you focus on is really 
just the distribution of the products and services that are manufactured at the home office. Therefore, you keep a 
very efficient opening operating model. The in-store costs, as you can see are very low relative to a traditional 
branch. This is conservative, but we say it's one-fifth at a minimum. The operating costs run about a half. The 
amount of new business opportunity, though, is substantial because of the floor traffic and store traffic when you 
open up a location. And the key there is the visits per week. Most of the bank customers today -- a lot of our best 
customers do not come to the bank at all. The averages right now at best are one visit per week. But in a store 
environment clearly you see them two to three times a week. So that ability to get to know the customer and 
serve the customer is pretty apparent. The size of the stores obviously are small, but the productivity is very high. 
We typically run those stores with 4 to 4.5 FTEs, and they therefore have very quick break-evens. 
Page 14 kind of goes into the cycle of opening up a de novo operation. The early years, one and two, are all 
about growing the business. We go in with a very aggressive promotional offer, both in terms of value and 
convenience. We don't have any maintenance as a result of having a new store and no customers. So the focus 
is 100 percent on revenue and new households and new opportunities to cross-sell. In that period of time the 
margin is very low. The growth rate is very high. It tends to be mostly deposits and very little loans. 
As quickly as we can we move into stage two, which is continuing the deposit growth, cutting the cost back 
slightly and then focusing more on the cross-sell of loan relationships into those banking relationships. As you do 
that the (indiscernible) expands from the very low margin on the front where you're predominantly in the 
investment arena to a mix of fewer investments and more loans. The returns move up to the middle of our normal 
range as we start to add in more fee income, more investment income, mortgage origination income, and 
obviously the loan income.

Page 52 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
They tend to mature in the seven years and out. At that time the deposit rates are at market, loan demand is 
typically much higher, the fee income is steady from the investments and mortgage and the returns become very 
significant. Clearly in that stage two and stage three area we start to look for hub opportunities to off-load some of 
the private banking and commercial banking opportunities that are stirred up in the retail locations. Above you can 
see the kind of growth rate we've had with the de novo model over 18 years and over the most recent 3 years. 
Page 15 is an example of a very unique de novo experience we've been through with First Market Bank in 
Richmond, Virginia. We started there a little over six years ago with no brand, no name and not one customer, 
and really not any banking opportunities in that part of the state of Virginia. We were in Roanoke under our 
National Bank of Commerce brand. We struck a partnership with the local number one grocery chain in the city, 
the Ukrops chain, and started from zero. Here is where we are at the end of 2003, and More importantly where 
we are today. As of last week we were $648 million in loans and 917 million in deposits, which as you can see is 
already significantly above the 2003 number. You can see the mix of hubs and spokes. We have 22 in-stores and 
8 traditionals. We have a classic main office there. We have all the services of a major bank in that market. We 
have the trust, the wealth management, commercial lending, private banking, in addition to all the traditional 
services throughout the branch network. This is a classic example of how you can go into a new market with a 
hub and spoke opportunity, picking a great partner in terms of a grocery store chain and growing your business. 
We currently are working on another de novo opportunity that we think could be the biggest in our history. Over 
the last five years we've been doing some business with Wal-Mart, predominantly in the area between Atlanta 
and Chattanooga. Up until recently we were operating 16 Wal-Marts in that area of the world. In October we 
changed the names of the stores in the Wal-Marts from National Bank of Commerce to Wal-Mart Money Centers 
by the National Bank of Commerce. And this is a test that we're doing with Wal-Mart to see if we can transfer the 
value proposition and the trust in value over to the bank from Wal-Mart. Initial indications are that more and more 
of the shoppers are checking with us to understand what the Wal-Mart Money Center is, and as a result we're 
taking that opportunity to add new households to that banking network. 
As of today, and this slide is -- we've kind of started this slide a little different. We've taken the hubs out and we're 
really watching this as a Wal-Mart only strategy now. Two hubs there were two locations up in Cartersville, 
Georgia that we had mixed in with the Wal-Marts. We have started to separate that now, and I'd like to just maybe 
focus on those numbers today. But as of today we now have 20 Wal-Mart stores; we opened up 4 really in the 
last four weeks in the same general geography. We are at $500 million in deposits and we have $80 million in 
loans just in Wal-Mart, so I've taken the two hubs out. The average there is about $32 million in deposits per store 
and about $5 million in loans. If you taken that into our normal P&L on an unallocated basis after all direct costs 
we're making about $400,000 per store in the mature stores, the first 16. 
The exciting thing here is the bottom part of this slide. Wal-Mart and NCF recently have agreed on taking on new 
stores in the Florida and Georgia geography. Again, these are all Supercenters -- grocery store and a Wal-Marts 
side-by-side, 200,000 square feet plus, with traffic counts of easy 30 to 50,000 people a week. Our intention there 
is to operate the Wal-Mart group, which you can see already is 100 plus when you add the two together, and 
growing as we see new stores come and create a totally unique retail bank, a Wal-Mart Money Center kind of a 
bank, where we operate maybe even a different brand and compete with ourselves in a totally unique retail 
concept focused on really loans and deposits, retail only, small-business to some degree, and then the fee 
services of wealth management and mortgage to go around those for shoppers in that store that need any form of 
wealth management and/or mortgage opportunities. 
We're very excited about this. This hits break-even much faster than our traditional de novo entry. The costs to 
operate are very similar. The fact that they are remote we've proven is not a problem. We have a store in Moultry, 
Georgia today that's basically four hours from any other store we operate. We handle that with a FedEx courier 
network where we bring the deposits to Memphis every night. So we're very excited about this unique distribution 
opportunity from a retail perspective. And clearly, coupling up with SunTrust allows us to be even more 
aggressive in the roll-out of this unique concept across our footprint. 
Phil already alluded to the complementary commercial capabilities, but I will reinforce that again. Our niche is 
really up to 50 million in revenue. We do some customers over that size obviously, but the majority of our 
business really is retail, small-business and middle market up to about 50 million in revenue. And that is a very 
sweet spot in terms of a mix of business, both from an asset quality and asset risk, but also from a yield 
perspective. This group of customers tends to be, as we all know, a little better on the NIM side. They tend to use 
you for multiple services, and there's a deep and rewarding revenue stream from this kind of a client base. 
The thing we're not very good at, in fact don't get do, is the over 50 million as a group. We do the locally owned 
over 50s, but once you get into a public company atmosphere we are not in that business, and we are looking

Page 53 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
forward to being in that business with SunTrust. We know that the publicly traded companies that are 
home-based in our geography are great private banking and wealth management prospects on the retail side, so 
getting into those corporations with the great corporate finance products you have and banking products will allow 
us to penetrate the private banking and wealth management opportunities in that workforce. So we're very excited 
about that. 
Clearly the credit culture is a 100 percent complement. SunTrust for a large bank has the best credit quality of 
any large bank in the United States. 
Page 18 gets into a little bit of the same information on the middle market commercial opportunity. We clearly are 
going to have the best offering in the footprint. From our perspective SunTrust already is extremely well 
represented and our footprint where we compete. We look at SunTrust as one of our best competitors, if not our 
best competitor, when it comes to corporate middle market kind of opportunities. So clearly taking what you have 
in addition to what we already do is going to allow us to penetrate this market even more. 
Page 19 gets into another area where SunTrust is going to add a lot to our in-market opportunities. On the trust 
and wealth management side we're really in a transition period as we speak. In some markets we are already 
established; in others we had a lot of work to do, and we were in the process of converting to some new software 
and some additional products. That all is unnecessary as a result of this combination. We know that with the 
product mix and process mix that SunTrust has and the way they operate that we're going to do very well in the 
asset gathering business. 
Last year we did have good results in both our retail and our trust. The trust area had about a $25 million revenue 
stream and the retail brokerage had about a $27 million revenue stream. We know both of those will be enhanced 
with the transfer in of the SunTrust wealth management model. 
The culture, I think slide 20 tells it all. You can see that the already great results of both companies mixed 
together, I think, will actually create an even more impressive profile. Our mix of business, again, is more middle 
market, small. If you mix that in with the total STI mix of business, I think you will see a very conservative loan 
portfolio from a mix standpoint, I think you'll see a very attractive portfolio from an asset quality standpoint, and I 
think also you'll see an opportunity for both sides to help each other on their strengths in this part of the business. 
This is clearly one of the most outstanding asset quality charts you'll see anywhere in the US. 
PHIL HUMANN: Okay, Bill, thanks for your perspective. Great job. If you all will turn to page 21 and following on 
on page 22, we want to give you some metrics with respect to why we think that this transaction is all about 
growth and the fact that these two companies complement each other extremely well. 
First, net interest income. SunTrust has gone from flattish to sort of low, mid-single digit number with room for 
improvement that we think will come right away. National Commerce net interest income expanded on a 
year-over-year basis almost twice the rate of SunTrust. Conversely, on the fee income side, given the fact that 
SunTrust has a much bigger market -- series of market sensitive businesses, the fee income is in the mid-teens 
versus mid-single digits for National Commerce. 
Now for those of you who have been somewhere between concerned and outraged at SunTrust expense 
discipline, I want you to take a very hard look at the third line, non-interest expense. National Commerce is 
operating on a very low single digit year-over-year expense increase, and I think this merger will show you that 
SunTrust is increasingly concerned and interested in improving our expense ratio. Because of these differences 
and the fact they do complement each other, you'll see that net income for both companies is up very strong low 
double digit performance quarter-over-quarter. 
If you move on to page 22, continuing its exercise National Commerce's net interest margin is significantly higher 
than SunTrust, although, as you know, we've put the margin pressure behind us and expect, as we did in the first 
quarter, to have a gradually improving margin. Fee income ratios for both companies are comparable in the 35 to 
40 percent, but a big difference in the efficiency ratio, almost 10 points between the two companies. As Bill said, 
credit is not an issue, as indicated by very low and sustainable charge-off ratios on both sides. 
Page 23 we have subtitled, "You Caught us at Just the Right Time". If you look at where SunTrust is in improving 
its core strengths and leveraging them from an improved economy and an improved rate outlook, you'll see that 
corporate and investment banking, our entire wealth management suite and our treasury operation are poised 
and leveraged for the economic upturn and at some point rising interest rates. So we think that even without 
National Commerce, SunTrust prospects continue to improve. With National Commerce they improve 
considerably more.

Gary? 
GARY PEACOCK: Page 24, shows the GAAP pro forma earnings impact. I will call your attention to the very 
conservative assumptions we've made, especially with cost savings. In 2006 the $76 million is the after-tax value 
of the 117 million expense target. Also, we've included -- we've broken out the interest expense and the intangible 
amortization for you. I will also point out that we have factored into our results incremental marketing spend to 
support this incremental customer base and to get us through the transaction. So that is net cost, a net 
reinvestment back into the franchise. I think you'll also note that the purchase accounting adjustments are very 
small, minor. But let me also point out that they're low, but this was at the time the deal was structured. The 
important number is what's the purchase accounting adjustments at the time of close. We are studying the effects 
of interest rate movements on the marked-to-market effect, and we will appropriately mitigate that risk if 
necessary. So at least in today's world the purchase accounting adjustments are low and we will mitigate any 
harm if they grow larger as a result of interest rate movements. 
On page 25, accretion/dilution in first-year 2005, it's dilutive by 10 cents a share or a little less than 2 percent on 
the GAAP basis and on a cash basis it's accretive immediately. Moving to 2006, it's accretive by 8 cents a share 
on a GAAP basis and 17 cents a share on a cash basis, which is approaching a 3 percent accretion. Let me also 
point out very conservative assumptions -- there are no revenue synergies at all, although we do believe there will 
be opportunities to improve revenue. But there are no revenue synergies in the pricing model. There are very 
reasonable cost saves. The costs of debt is very reasonable and the deposit intangible amortization is 
appropriate, and we haven't goosed any of the results using share repurchases. So all in all, reasonable accretion 
back to the shareholder based on reasonable model assumptions. 
Moving to Page 26, premium to market about 23 percent, a little less than average. The GAAP EPS, we paid a 
little over 18 times earnings, which is higher than precedent transactions, but we will also tell you that there really 
aren't any comparable franchises. This franchise has been growing at between 11 and 12 percent earnings, and 
as Phil point out, the footprint is in all the right high-growth neighborhoods. 
We've also broken out for you in the Appendix on page 37 some other ways to look at valuation. Looking at PE 
ratios compared to growth, or PEG ratio, our transaction at 1.6 times is right at average and right at medians 
transactions for most recent transaction, and we think that's another way to look at it and perhaps an appropriate 
way to look at the 18 times GAAP earnings number. 
Finally, on a book value basis, 2.5 times. The IRR is 13 percent versus our believed (ph) cost of capital between 
10 and 11 percent. And let me also point out there are no tricks in this IRR calculation. We didn't move SunTrust 
growth rate to National Commerce's growth rate in earnings. We didn't move our fixed income mix of revenue to 
theirs. We didn't move their efficiency ratio to our efficiency ratio. And we have reasonable cost saves, cost of 
debt, intangible amounts, etc. But there is no tricks in the IRR. It is a very reasonable but conservative calculation 
and does overcome the hurdle cost of capital. 
On page 27, from a valuation perspective about 11 times 2006 on a GAAP basis, 10.5 on a cash basis. These are 
very low multiples compared to peers and we would expect expansion from these rates over time. Looking at 
perhaps what is the opportunity looking forward on a blended growth rate, the two organizations could grow near 
10 percent, which would indicate a 2006 PEG ratio of just a little over one-to-one, and if earnings growth rate 
does accelerate -- again not in the pricing model, but this is looking more forward -- the PEG ratio could move 
actually better than a one-to-one ratio. We also show what the PEGs are for existing southeastern peers, and I 
would hope that you would agree that this is a reasonable way to look at it and we do fit in within that range. 
On page 28 we talked about the cost saves -- very reasonable 117 million; no revenue synergies. The 
restructuring reserve is detailed and broken out for you in the Appendix at 245 million. The cost of debt is 3.5 
percent, which we view as conservative at the time the deal was priced. Also note that based on what happened 
on Friday, this cost of debt may be a little low, but I would also point out that if the cost of debt is higher there's 
also corresponding offsets on the earning asset side. So at the time this deal was priced it's more appropriate for 
you to look at this cost of debt versus more of a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday cost of funding, and the earning 
asset yields we were looking at at that point were in a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday timeframe in the last 
week. So it is a conservative number, and if it is higher we will get the offsets on the earning asset side. Finally, 
the growth rate of earnings was using both IBIS for National Commerce and for SunTrust. 
Page 29, the cost saves. About 20 percent of National Commerce's expense base, about 3 percent on a 
combined National Commerce and SunTrust basis, both very far below what the average precedent transactions 
have been. We will also show you on page 30 that 21 percent of the branch overlaps occur within one mile. You 
look at that overlap versus the cost saves, and we would conclude that the cost saves are reasonable.

Moving to page -- let me just hit highly a couple of items that are for you in the Appendix so you don't miss them. 
On page 33 we show revenue opportunities. Again, revenue is not in the pricing model, but these are areas that 
we would expect to get revenue in; 34 is the restructuring reserve; page 35 through 36 we detail information 
about our integration experience and how we think about the proper way to execute against integration risk; the 
pricing comps on page 37; and then there's some additional financial data on both a pro forma basis and on 
National Commerce in the remaining pages. 
So now let me turn it back over to Phil to finish up. 
PHIL HUMANN: In wrapping up here I would like for you to take another look at our key messages because I 
believe the information we've shared with you this morning has substantiated each of these points. 
The best footprint in banking just got better. We have very complementary business models, and look forward to 
learning from National Commerce's best-of-breed retail model. The combined organization is poised for 
significantly accelerated growth, although as Gary said there is not one nickel of revenue enhancements included 
in the financials. And the financial profile, I hope you believe are reasonable, are based on very reasonable and 
achievable and ultra-conservative assumptions. 
So with that let me turn it back over to Gary and we will enjoy receiving your questions and comments. 
GARY PEACOCK: Operator, will you explain how callers should queue themselves to ask questions and 
answers, please? 
OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) Jon Balkind. 
JON BALKIND, ANALYST, FOX-PITT KELTON: Good morning. Fox-Pitt Kelton. Just had two quick questions. 
One, could you discuss in a little more detail what management changes may be taking place? And two, big 
picture on the retail model going forward. It always appeared to me that National Commerce had sort of two ways 
of doing its in-store model -- one, going into a new market where they have not existed before, under pricing and 
then building hubs around it; the other, going into a market where they already had hubs. And it always seemed 
to me the former lead to the above average growth rate. I'm just wondering how the long-term growth dynamic at 
National Commerce changes within the SunTrust model. 
PHIL HUMANN: Let me try to address the first one, and I might ask Bill to talk about the second thing. 
One of the best byproducts of this merger is that we get Bill Reed's experience and leadership and expertise. He 
will be joining our policy committee. All of this happened sufficiently rapidly that we haven't yet worked out the 
specifics, but he will be here in Atlanta with our top executive management group working every day to make 
things better. 
With respect to other National Commerce management, I think SunTrust has by far the best record of anyone in 
the industry of retaining top talent through mergers and acquisitions. So there will be key spots for many National 
Commerce people in the combined organization. And we will be working all that out posthaste, but really don't 
have any specific announcements to make at this point. 
BILL REED: As it relates to your second question, we're very tactical and surgical as we roll-out the in-store. 
You're right, if we go to a de novo market we are very aggressive, primarily through the media and a lot of in-store 
promotions. When we go into a hub and spoke more mature market, we're still pretty darn tactical and surgical. 
We use a lot of direct-mail in and around the store, we use a lot of in-store promotions, and we do continue to the 
aggressors on value in those early stages. A lot of times what happens when you do an in market in-store 
addition, you energize the branch and our other stores close by. So we tend even on occasion from time to time 
included in some of the existing stores in that new promotion and that direct-mail attack. But the whole idea is the 
same, and that is to generate a lot of new customers as fast as possible. It's just a little more stealth-like when 
you're doing a spoke addition into a mature market. But we're still doing it. 
JON BALKIND: In terms of the Atlanta build-out, the growth rate doesn't change in your view from being a 
stand-alone company to joining SunTrust? Cannibalization of the SunTrust deposit base does not concerned 
you? 
BILL REED: No, it does not. I think our stealth-like direct-mail that we do for all products in mature markets could 
be very additive to the way SunTrust adds business normally. We haven't got into the tactics yet, but I can tell you 
our marketing area -- Candace Lex (ph). We have in fact started reselling that expertise through the NCBS

Page 56 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Group. She has tremendous, efficient ways of generating prospects out of mature markets. So I'm very optimistic 
about that. 
JON BALKIND: Thank you very much. 
OPERATOR: Jeff Davis. 
JEFF DAVIS, ANALYST, FTN: Good morning. FTN. Bill, could you give us a little more color on the thought 
process the Board went through with regards two why sell now and how that related to the business plan and 
perhaps awaiting a couple of years to build out Atlanta and develop the relationship with Wal-Mart? 
BILL REED: I'd rather not spend a lot of time on that. I think you and other gentlemen and ladies in your business 
know how the world is and how these kind of things come about, and I don't think anyone occurs any significantly 
different than others. But I can tell you this was one of many options, and to me the most important option was 
staying independent. But clearly the opportunity here to be together with a company like SunTrust versus being 
independent at this time we thought was a much bigger opportunity. So that's the bottom line. 
JEFF DAVIS: That's fine. Thank you. 
OPERATOR: Jason Goldberg. 
JASON GOLDBERG, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Lehman Brothers. I think I will ask it a different way. Bill, 
you and I sat down for over an hour about a week and a half ago and you were very upbeat on National 
Commerce's prospects as a stand-alone and the success you're having with your recent initiative program 
actually called Project Independence, ironically. Did anything change in the last week and a half? 
BILL REED: No, nothing has changed other than the fact that -- a big change. And I still think all the work we did 
in Project Independence is going to be important going forward with SunTrust. We've made ourself an even 
better, stronger company by really removing what we call non-value added work and non-value added processes 
so we generated more time and opportunity to create revenue. That's something you have to do no matter who 
you are, and you have to do it all the time. So that process was energizing and invigorating. But I think it didn't 
mean we wouldn't do this kind of a transaction; I think it just means if and when we did we would be much better 
off. So I really am proud of what we've accomplished with Project Independence. And a lot of those things, it's 
project strong or strengthening or whatever because we're a better company; made us more attractive to anyone 
like SunTrust. But more importantly I think it's got us positioned to help someone like SunTrust even more. 
PHIL HUMANN: At the risk of being slightly braggadocio, and although I cannot speak for the NCF Board, I think 
they embraced the SunTrust story of a return to core growth, return to double-digit earnings performance and a 
higher stock price. I think that was a significant part in their decision. 
JASON GOLDBERG: And then I guess $97 million of the $245 million restructuring charge is allocated to the 
balance sheet. Can you maybe expand a little bit in terms of is that to reduce interest rate sensitivity or what is 
that tied to? 
GARY PEACOCK: It's tied to the cost in purchase accounting you do a mark-to-mark. That would be the mark 
towards. That will be the mark towards the beginning to middle part of the week. Some of you analysts may 
choose to take the mark out of what we're calling restructure because we're showing a restructure that's in excess 
of two times annual cost saves. But that is the world we live in in a purchase accounting world. 
JASON GOLDBERG: So I guess no one additional kind of balance sheet restructuring charges --? 
GARY PEACOCK: I'm sorry? 
JASON GOLDBERG: No kind of balance sheet restructuring charges to alter rate sensitivity? 
GARY PEACOCK: At this point we don't know, but if you're asking would we anticipate having a huge onetime 
charge, huge restructure charge, we would not anticipate that. That's not our style. 
JASON GOLDBERG: Lastly, I am sorry if I missed it. Did you say in terms of branding is the whole franchise 
going to be rebranded SunTrust? 
PHIL HUMANN: Yes, except to the extent accent that we retain the Wal-Mart Money Store situation. And 
obviously to the extent that the First Market franchise is retained, we would probably leave it alone. But generally 
speaking we're going to be calling ourselves SunTrust.

Page 57 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
BILL REED: Basically the National Bank of Commerce and the Central Carolina Bank, those two brands will go 
into the SunTrust brand. 
JASON GOLDBERG: Thank you. 
OPERATOR: Gerry Cronin. 
GERRY CRONIN, ANALYST, SANDLER O'NEILL ASSET MANAGEMENT: Good morning. Sandler O'Neill Asset 
Management. Two questions, if I may. First of all, Gary, on page 24 where you talk about the adjustments, your 
net intangible amortization, I come out with a number almost twice as high as that and I'm just wondering is there 
any offset to what would just be the true intangible amortization in that line? 
GARY PEACOCK: Yes there is -- and let me get to the right page. 
GERRY CRONIN: I think it's 24. 
GARY PEACOCK: Keep in mind that this intangible amortization is after-tax. You got that part? Let me get to the 
assumption page because there's both the core deposit intangible and then there's also the intangible of other. 
On page 28 we're building an intangible of the 2.75 of their core deposits and we're amortizing over ten years 
using some of the years digits. And then there's another 75 million that is amortized over ten years. Also keep in 
mind that jumbo CDs, etc. are not considered core deposits. You may be starting with too large of a deposit 
number and applying a core deposit intangible against too large of a number. 
GERRY CRONIN: Okay. Again, I know you didn't disclose this, but if you just take the 2.75 percent on National 
Commerce's core deposit that gives you about a $370 million core deposit intangible. If you amortize that over 10 
years some of your digits, you come out with a substantially higher amortization expense. It's almost 43 million 
after-tax. That's why I'm wondering if there's any offset to those two intangible amortization lines. 
GARY PEACOCK: Yes. Let me call you later and walk you through the math around that. 
GERRY CRONIN: That is fine. Secondly, if I can ask a question to Phil. Phil, I'm just curious in terms of how you 
view the transaction from a financial perspective; how much, if any, consideration you give to the amount of 
dilution you took on in terms of tangible book value. Thank you. 
PHIL HUMANN: I'm sorry. You want to talk about dilution with respect to book value? He may have dropped off. I 
may be answering the wrong question here, but if you look the accretion/dilution again you'll see that the 
transaction is accretive on a cash basis from the get go; on a GAAP basis dilutive less than 2 percent in year one, 
again based on ultra-conservative assumptions and no tricks. And therefore, we think we can meet or exceed the 
financial projection. I hope that's responsive to your question. If not, you can call back and we will try to answer it. 
OPERATOR: Jennifer Thompson. 
JENNIFER THOMPSON, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER: Oppenheimer. Just a couple of quick questions. You 
mentioned that one of Nationals Commerce's strengths is its de novo expansion expertise. I was just wondering 
your thoughts on changing the company's de novo strategy. Is there a thought to become more aggressive 
building out branches and are there any specific target areas you're thinking about? 
PHIL HUMANN: You're actually a little ahead of us. I think you're pointing in the right direction because one of the 
attributes of this is that SunTrust gets to learn from the fabulously successful de novo branching efforts of 
National Commerce. But what, when, where, who and how, we haven't gotten to that yet. 
JENNIFER THOMPSON: My other question was in terms of asset sensitivity. You probably don't have specific 
numbers, but in general how does the combination impact asset sensitivity compared to SunTrust stand-alone, 
which was fairly asset sensitive compared to the group? 
GARY PEACOCK: The first answer is we're still studying it, but the answer I think you want to get to is we are 
very slightly asset sensitive, as are they, in the first quarter. So from a total combined asset sensitivity, we don't 
think that there's much difference on a combined basis than there was on an individual, at least with that metric. 
JENNIFER THOMPSON: Thanks a lot. 
OPERATOR: John McDonald.

Page 58 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
JOHN MCDONALD, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES: Banc of America Securities. You mentioned 
that you're not building in buy backs. Just wondering how comfortable you are with the excess capital levels and 
what your appetite might be to step up the buy backs? The stock is getting hit pretty hard today. 
GARY PEACOCK: We try not to comment on the stock price and any one moment in time. Our view is to build 
stock price over time. We clearly built in no repurchases because it was a conservative assumption to make in the 
model. We may at some point decide to return to repurchases, but this transaction, because it does have a cash 
component, does bring down the capital ratios in the early years, but we believe that the capital will return above 
to where it is today over about a two-year period. 
JOHN MCDONALD: Gary, did you mention the cash component, how you're funding that? Do you have the cash? 
GARY PEACOCK: We have -- 
JOHN SPIEGEL, VP & CFO, SUNTRUST: This is John Spiegel. We have about 1 billion 8 in funds, about 800 
million that will flow-through the dividends in the normal stream from the bank, from SunTrust bank to the parent. 
In addition to that, it is anticipated that we will do a transaction of about 1 billion to fund the rest at the parent 
level, and that we would do that fairly soon. 
JOHN MCDONALD: Okay. My last question was of the overall cost savings, how much of that would be coming 
from Tennessee overlap? I saw how you broke (technical difficulty) just a general sense of how much comes from 
the overlap in Tennessee. 
GARY PEACOCK: That is really a merger integration question. We have thoughts, but it would be premature for 
us to get into state-level or city-level opportunities to combined operations. I'd like to hold that question until we're 
a little further along the integration path. Again, let me point out that based on our assumed costs saves versus 
precedent transactions it is a very conservative assumption, and we believe achievable. 
JOHN MCDONALD: Thanks. 
OPERATOR: David Hilder. 
DAVID HILDER, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: Bear Stearns. First, you have used the IBIS estimates in the 
presentation as a basis for your earnings numbers or your example there. Can you talk about how those numbers 
relate to your own expectations for '05 and '06? Are you comfortable with that? Do you think you can do better? 
Do you think that's a stretch? 
GARY PEACOCK: We don't believe in giving guidance, so I'm not going to confirm that number. But this was an 
example we used to justify the pricing. 
I will also tell you that other than using IBIS we also stress test our model for various growth rates -- best case, 
worst-case, etc. -- and we became comfortable with the overall pricing, but what we're demonstrating for you is 
IBIS because that's the convention to use at merger announcement, and it seemed to be a safe, acceptable way 
to do it. But we're not going to necessarily affirm the IBIS growth rate. 
DAVID HILDER: Can you talk at all about a targeted efficiency ratio for the combined company? I think you talked 
earlier about not assuming that SunTrust efficiency ratio would be applied to National Commerce and I doubt that 
that would have increased the IRR. 
GARY PEACOCK: Well, given that their efficiency ratio is lower than ours, especially if you look at the GAAP 
basis, just a mixed differential would cause the efficiency ratio -- when you do the math -- would cause the 
efficiency ratio to come down. The rest of the costs saves, you can do the mathematics around 117 million of cost 
saves on a combined organization and what that efficiency ratio looks like. And then further improvements would 
come as a result of the integration planning, and we're not far enough along to detail that for you. 
DAVID HILDER: So no specific target on that? 
GARY PEACOCK: No, not at this time. 
DAVID HILDER: (multiple speakers) referenced a transaction at the parent company. I was assuming that is debt, 
but I guess I should just ask. Is that debt, equity or some hybrid?

Page 59 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
JOHN SPIEGEL: We're looking straight at the debt at the moment. We're looking at the pricing of some hybrid as 
well. It would be an opportunistic move into the hybrids if the markets were favorable towards that. But we have 
planned it on straight debt, senior debt. 
DAVID HILDER: My last question. Phil, can you give us any other indication about what Bill Reed will be working 
on once he moves to Atlanta? 
PHIL HUMANN: I don't know whether you missed that part of the call, but I said that Bill is going to be joining our 
executive management as a member of both our policy committee and management committee, and we're going 
to be working on his specific responsibilities here as we move forward. He obviously has to stay and run NCF 
until the transaction closes. But I hope you noted his enthusiasm this morning, and he will have a very senior role 
in our executive management, and that's just the best I can do this morning. 
DAVID HILDER: That's great. I did notice that, and I'm delighted for you to get Bill, and I was just trying to probe 
to see if you had come up with anything more specific. Thanks very much. 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I would like to add to Gary's answer to your question. I think 
slide 21 and 22 deserve a lot of focus. If you look at the last five quarters for the two companies, in that variety of 
measurements I think there's some pretty outstanding numbers. That's where I would tell you look. 
PHIL HUMANN: You ought to at least get the direction out of that. 
GARY PEACOCK: We have time for one more question. 
OPERATOR: Jefferson Harralson. 
JEFFERSON HARRALSON, ANALYST, KBW: God morning. KBW. At SunTrust you guys have resisted the urge 
to lever your balance sheet and that seems like a pretty good opportunity. National Commerce has a pretty 
levered balance sheet with about a third of the earning assets in bond. How did that play into I guess your ideas 
on pricing as you did pay a premium for this bank? How did the leveraged National Commerce balance sheet play 
into your pricing? 
GARY PEACOCK: We looked at earnings versus earnings from bond portfolio, we looked at various interest rate 
scenarios and got comfortable with the pricing. Especially, again -- and I don't want to sound like a broken record 
-- when are considering their earnings growth rate and they are in absolutely all of the right high-growth 
neighborhoods. So this is not just North Carolina and parts of South Carolina and Memphis that we weren't in, but 
the right parts of all of those neighborhoods. This was not a sneaky way to lever the combined balance sheet. 
National Commerce has been -- their methodology is to grow deposits very rapidly, loans early on and their de 
novo strategy don't grow at the same rate so they end up with excess liquidity. 
PHIL HUMANN: The fact is, Jefferson, Gary will probably have to tell me the precise number, but the combined 
investment portfolio of the consolidated company is -- 
GARY PEACOCK: Twenty-one percent. 
PHIL HUMANN: Twenty-one percentish, which is sort of middle of the road. 
JEFFERSON HARRALSON: Lastly, you haven't mentioned the financial enterprises too much. How do you guys 
see that fitting into the SunTrust mantra? 
UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: All of our conversations to date have been in total support 
embracing of our subsidiaries that we operate. Some of those are very small and growing rapidly; others are more 
important. But clearly I think both sides recognize there's some true value there, and we're going to try to continue 
those growth rates and continue those kind of investments. 
JEFFERSON HARRALSON: Thanks a lot. 
GARY PEACOCK: With that we will be adjourned. I will be around today to take questions. Thank you.

(c) 2004 Reuters Limited 
(Updates stock prices and deal value; adds analyst quote in graph 3, analysis in graph 4) 
NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - SunTrust Banks (STI.N) on Monday defended its nearly $6.6 billion acquisition 
of National Commerce Financial (NCF.N), noting the deal filled critical holes in the southeastern U.S. bank's 
retail footprint while strengthening its focus on mid-market businesses. 
But investors still sent the Atlanta-based company's stock down nearly 7.6 percent on concerns about the deal's 
short-term dilution to earnings, high cost and potential integration risks. 
"Ultimately, we think this transaction represents a logical franchise extension, but we simply would have liked to 
see it accomplished at a more reasonable price, given the large valuation disparity between the two companies," 
said Kevin Fitzgibbons, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. 
Indeed, SunTrust's purchase price represented one of the steepest price-to-tangible book values paid in a sizable 
U.S. bank deal this year, though when measured by other metrics such as median price-to-earnings, it is on par 
with industry averages. 
SunTrust projected on Monday the acquisition, announced Sunday afternoon, would dilute its 2005 earnings 
slightly, but result in a combined pro-forma GAAP earnings per share of $6.15 in 2006, versus $6.07 on a 
stand-alone basis. 
The deal is not expected to impact SunTrust's cash earnings per share estimate of $5.72 in 2005, but increase 
cash earnings to $6.35 per share in 2006 from the previous forecast of $6.18 per share. 
"This is not about size," said Phillip Humann, SunTrust's chairman and chief executive. "We've long said we like 
mergers that either let us expand geographically into markets with strong demographics and high growth 
characteristics, or enhance our business capabilities. This merger is the best of both. 
"If we didn't already have the best footprint in banking, I think you could make the argument definitively now." 
EXPANDED REACH 
Indeed, adding National Commerce significantly bolsters SunTrust's presence in the Carolinas - a market it has 
craved since losing a heated 2001 battle to acquire Wachovia Corp., which ultimately was purchased by rival First 
Union. 
It also strengthens the company's product line, particularly among small-to mid-size business owners with less 
than $50 million in annual revenue. 
Few analysts interviewed questioned the deal's strategic rationale, but many said they were surprised at 
SunTrust's willingness to aggressively bid for the Memphis, Tennessee-based bank. 
Cincinnati's Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O), which has been looking to expand into the Southeast, also made a 
strong bid for National Commerce that was on par financially with SunTrust's bid, according to sources close to 
the situation. 
But in the end, National Commerce's board chose SunTrust, which has been both a longtime customer and 
competitor.

"We have a long and enduring relationship and a lot of mutual respect," said William Reed, National Commerce's 
president and CEO. "We know what's here and we appreciate what's here." 
SunTrust shares fell $5.08 to close at $61.80 on the New York Stock Exchange, while National Commerce shares 
fell 70 cents or 2.2 percent to $31.10. 
The company expects $117 million in pretax cost savings from the merger, with 60 percent of the savings 
achieved in 2005 and all the following year.

following decline in SunTrust shares Monday.) 
By Mary Ellen Lloyd 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
CHARLOTTE (Dow Jones)--SunTrust Banks Inc.'s (STI) nearly $6.6 billion acquisition of National Commerce 
Financial Corp. (NCF) solidifies the Atlanta bank's position in the Southeast, but at a hefty price. 
Analysts said the cash-and-stock transaction, announced Sunday, fills a geographic hole for the company in the 
Carolinas and should help SunTrust remain independent. 
But its shares could suffer in the short term amid potentially rising short-term interest rates and investor concern 
over integration risk, Merrill Lynch analyst Rodrigo Quintanilla said in a morning research note Monday. In 
addition, the stock may no longer command a takeout premium since the transaction reinforces SunTrust's 
strategy to remain independent, he and other analysts said. 
Prudential Equity Group analyst Michael Mayo downgraded SunTrust shares to underweight from neutral weight 
on Monday, saying the benefit of the deal may not be worth the price. In its first big deal since it acquired Crestar 
six years ago, SunTrust again seemed "to overreach," he said, "sending a bad signal about its ability to act 
opportunistically." 
Under terms of the definitive agreement, National Commerce shareholders can exchange their shares for cash, 
SunTrust stock, or a combination of the two. In any case, the value is equal to $8.625 plus 0.3713 SunTrust 
shares for each National Commerce share. 
The acquisition, slated to close in the fourth quarter, values National Commerce shares at $31.57 based on 
SunTrust's recent price of $61.80. Shares of SunTrust fell $5.08, or 8%, Monday following the deal's 
announcement, and National Commerce shares declined 70 cents, or 2%, to $31.10. 
The deal price represented a 19% premium for National Commerce shares before they rose Friday on takeover 
rumors. 
SunTrust said the deal makes it the seventh-largest U.S. bank by assets and ranks it in the top five in 20 of the 25 
largest high-growth markets in the Southeast. Chairman and Chief Executive L. Phillip Humann said the deal 
creates "an incomparable high-growth banking franchise." 
"If we didn't already have the best footprint in banking, I think you can make the case that we do now," Humann, 
who is also president, said in a conference call with analysts and investors Monday. 
National Commerce provides SunTrust with growth markets along Interstate 85 in North Carolina, including 
Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, Greensboro and Charlotte. It also adds Memphis and Greenville, S.C., and 
enhances its presence in Atlanta, Richmond, Nashville and Knoxville, Tenn. The companies said SunTrust will 
apply its expertise in large- and middle-market banking, wealth management and investment banking across the 
National Commerce footprint. Meanwhile, SunTrust will benefit from National Commerce's strength in small

business banking, commercial real estate, and expertise in in-store banking and de novo expansions, executives 
said. 
The franchise, which will stretch from Maryland to South Florida and claim the third-highest share of the market in 
the Southeast, gives SunTrust markets that have a projected population growth of 8.7% for 2003-2008, compared 
with a national average growth rate of 5.3%, SunTrust said. That gives the company the top growth rate among 
top-20 banks and the highest in the Southeast, Humann said. 
The companies overlap in 19% of their markets, so branch consolidations should be limited, said Lehman 
Brothers analyst Jason Goldberg. Indeed, SunTrust said it expects no branch-based job cuts as a result of any 
branch consolidations. 
SunTrust said it expects to reduce annual operating expenses by about $117 million, with 60% of the savings 
realized in 2005 and the remainder beginning in 2006. The companies said attrition should take care of a 
"substantial majority" of the administrative and back-office job cuts resulting from the business combination. 
SunTrust said the deal would reduce pro forma estimated 2005 earnings by about 10 cents a share, or 1.7%, 
before adding about 8 cents a share, or 1.3%, to 2006 earnings. The pro forma estimates of $5.48 a share next 
year and $6.15 a share in 2006 are based on Wall Street's mean earnings forecasts of $5.58 a share for SunTrust 
alone in 2005 and $6.07 a share in 2006. 
SunTrust's estimates of the deal's impact don't include revenue increases that could result from deal synergies, 
nor do they assume any share repurchases. 
Goldberg said the purchase price represents 18.1 times his 2004 earnings estimate of $5.10, is 2.4 times book 
value and 4.4 times tangible book value. By comparison, six other recent large transactions averaged 15.2 times 
earnings, 2.6 times book value and 3.2 times tangible book value, he said. 
Paul Glazer, president of New York hedge fund Glazer Capital Management, said the thin spread between the 
deal price and National Commerce shares on Monday indicate Wall Street expects the deal to go through. 
"The market's telling you very clearly that this is considered to be a very safe deal," he said. "That makes a lot of 
sense because just analyzing the deal, there doesn't seem to be any regulatory problems or any risks to closing 
the transaction in a timely fashion." 
Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) of Cincinnati was also vying for National Commerce before SunTrust's bid won out, 
according to the Wall Street Journal. 
Glazer said his firm doesn't have a position in the companies' shares. 
Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch have investment-banking relationships with SunTrust, but none of the 
analysts quoted in this story owns shares.

CHARLOTTE (Dow Jones)--SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) expects its acquisition of National Commercial Financial 
Corp. (NCF) will hurt earnings by about 10 cents a share in 2005 and boost earnings by 8 cents a share in 2006. 
In a conference call with analysts and investors, company spokesman Gary Peacock said the pro forma 
estimates of $5.48 a share next year and $6.15 a share in 2006 are based on Wall Street's mean earnings 
forecasts of $5.58 a share for SunTrust alone in 2005 and $6.07 a share in 2006. 
On a cash basis, he said, SunTrust expects the deal will boost earnings by 0.1% in 2005, with per-share earnings 
unchanged at $5.72. It will add roughly 17 cents a share, or 2.7%, for cash earnings of $6.35 a share in 2006, 
according to the company's slide presentation on its Internet site. 
Peacock said SunTrust wouldn't comment on whether analysts' forecasts are reasonable, saying the company 
doesn't give guidance. He said estimates of the deal's impact don't include any potential share repurchases. 
SunTrust Chairman and Chief Executive L. Phillip Humann said the $6.98 billion cash-and-stock deal creates "an 
incomparable high-growth banking franchise." 
"If we didn't already have the best footprint in banking, I think you can make the case that we do now," said 
Humann, who is also president of the Atlanta company. 
The franchise, which will stretch from Maryland to South Florida and claim the third-highest share of the market in 
the Southeast, gives SunTrust a strong presence in markets with a projected population growth of 8.7% for 
2003-2008, compared with a national average growth rate of 5.3%, SunTrust said. That gives the company the 
highest growth rate among top-20 banks and the highest in the Southeast, Humann said. 
SunTrust will be able to apply its expertise in large- and middle-market banking, wealth management and 
investment banking across the National Commerce franchise, he said. Meanwhile, National Commerce, 
Memphis, Tenn., is very strong in small business banking and commercial real estate, and it has leading 
expertise in in-store banking and de novo expansions, executives said. 
National Commerce Financial's net interest income has grown at a faster rate than SunTrust's over the last four 
quarters, while SunTrust's 16.7% growth of fee income has outpaced National Commerce's 6.5% growth rate, 
according to the companies. 
Humann said the acquisition shows SunTrust is increasingly concerned about improving its expense ratio. 
National Commerce's year-over-year increase in non-interest expenses was 2.3% at the end of the first quarter, 
compared with 9.1% for SunTrust. National Commerce's efficiency ratio is 51.5, compared with SunTrust's ratio of 
61.0. 
Meanwhile, executives said the companies' credit quality is similar, with the ratio of charge-offs to average loans 
0.30 for SunTrust and 0.28 for National Commerce.

ATLANTA (AP) _ SunTrust Banks Inc. is buying Memphis-based National Commerce Financial Corp. in a nearly 
$7-billion-US, cash-and-stock deal, the latest merger in the wave of consolidation sweeping the financial sector. 
The companies said the combination, which followed a reported bidding war between Atlanta-based SunTrust 
and Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp., would create the seventh-largest U.S bank, with $148 billion in assets 
and $97 billion in deposits. 
Under the terms of the $6.98 billion deal, NCF shareholders would receive $8.625 plus 0.3713 SunTrust share for 
each NCF share. Based on SunTrust's closing price Friday, the transaction is valued at $33.46 per NFC share _ a 
5.2 per cent premium above NCF's closing price on Friday. NCF shares surged 13 per cent to $31.80 Friday on 
speculation a deal was imminent. 
The pricetag includes $1.8 billion in cash with the balance in stock _ approximately 77.5 million SunTrust shares. 
``National Commerce, with its great franchise, talented people and high standards, is a superb fit for SunTrust,'' 
SunTrust chairman and chief executive L. Phillip Humann said. ``Our companies complement each other 
perfectly in terms of customer focus, geographic coverage and business orientation.'' 
A conference call with investors and analysts was scheduled for Monday morning. 
The merger follows a string of combinations in the national and regional banking business. Bank of America Corp. 
recently completed its $47 billion acquisition of FleetBoston Financial Corp., and the proposed $58 billion merger 
of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank One Corp. is pending. 
In January, Regions Financial Corp. and Union Planters Corp. agreed to merge in a $6 billion deal that creates a 
Southeastern banking powerhouse. The same month, Huntington Bancshares Inc. announced plans to acquire 
Unizan Financial Corp. in a stock deal the two companies valued at $587 million. 
Analysts had previously said NCF stood to benefit from a combination with either SunTrust or Fifth Third, since 
each offered access to customers in different regions. Published reports last week had speculated Fifth Third and 
SunTrust were offering at least $6 billion. At the time, SunTrust and Fifth Third both declined to comment. 
Messages left Sunday seeking comment from Fifth Third were not immediately returned. 
In a news release, the companies did not offer specifics about any job cuts. But the banks said that it anticipated 
``no branch-based job eliminations'' and that a ``substantial majority'' of other job cuts would occur through 
attrition. The new organization will have 1,723 full-service offices in 11 states plus the District of Columbia. 
NCF is the holding company for National Bank of Commerce, Central Carolina Bank & Trust and NBC Bank. It 
operates in Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia, Virginia and West Virginia. 
National Bank of Commerce has had branches in Wal-Mart stores since 1991. In a two-year test program begun 
last fall, some branches in Georgia and Tennessee have been operating under the name Wal-Mart Money 
Centres. 
SunTrust operates in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia and the District of Columbia. 
The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close by the end of the year. Later this week, 
customers will be able to use ATMs of either bank without a usage fee.

ATLANTA - SunTrust Banks Inc. is buying Memphis-based National Commerce Financial Corp. in a nearly $7 
billion cash-and-stock deal, the latest merger in the wave of consolidation sweeping the financial sector. "Lead"> 
The companies said the combination, which followed a reported bidding war between Atlanta-based SunTrust 
and Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp, would create the seventh-largest U.S bank, with $148 billion in assets 
and $97 billion in deposits. 
The deal will give SunTrust its first presence in the West Virginia market. That's because National Commerce's 
National Bank of Commerce subsidiary operates nine offices inside Kroger stores in the Charleston-Huntington 
region and a main office in the Kanawha Valley Bank Building on the northeast corner of Capital and Lee streets. 
The National Bank of Commerce has about 50 employees in West Virginia. 
Under the terms of the $6.98 billion deal announced Sunday, NCF shareholders would receive $8.625 plus 
0.3713 SunTrust share for each NCF share. Based on SunTrust's closing price Friday, the transaction is valued at 
$33.46 per NFC share - a 5.2 percent premium above NCF's closing price on Friday. NCF shares surged 13

$7 billion buy lifts SunTrust in Carolinas Bank firm vaults into top 10 with shrewd geographic deal

SunTrust Banks announced a $7 billion acquisition Sunday that will give it a long-coveted presence in North 
Carolina and a much bigger stake in South Carolina. 
Oddly enough, the route to the Carolinas leads through Memphis, home of National Commerce Financial, which 
SunTrust agreed to buy with a combination of stock and cash. 
National Commerce is about a sixth the size of SunTrust and operates in six states, including both Carolinas. 
SunTrust does not have bank branches in North Carolina, and its presence in South Carolina is limited to Hilton 
Head Island. 
The deal, which also catapults SunTrust into the top 10 largest U.S. banking firms, fills "a hole" in SunTrust's 
geographic footprint, said bank analyst Christopher Marinac, of FIG Partners in Atlanta. 
"It's terrific strategy," Marinac said. 
L. Phillip Humann, chairman and chief executive of SunTrust, said Sunday that getting into North Carolina has 
been "a long-standing goal." 
He said National Commerce's efficient retail banking operations and its track record of expanding from scratch --- 
rather than by buying competitors --- also proved attractive. 
An undisclosed number of jobs will be lost in the merger, although the banking companies said a "substantial 
majority" should come through normal attrition. SunTrust has about 27,500 employees; National Commerce 
5,400. 
Atlanta-based SunTrust said the merged companies expect to save about $117 million a year by consolidating 
administrative and back-office jobs. The companies said they do not expect to trim any bank branch jobs, 
because few SunTrust and National Commerce locations are close. 
Most of National Commerce's branches in metro Atlanta operate under the National Bank of Commerce name. 
All told, SunTrust estimated it will have merger-related costs of about $245 million. 
The acquisition of National Commerce would be the biggest for SunTrust since it agreed to buy Crestar Financial 
for $9.5 billion in July 1998. That deal put SunTrust into the Virginia-Washington, D.C., market. 
Three years later, SunTrust tried a bigger move --- a merger with Wachovia. Instead, Wachovia agreed to a deal 
with First Union, and the two North Carolina banks combined to create the current Wachovia. 
Under the agreement announced Sunday, National Commerce stockholders will get cash or SunTrust stock worth 
$33.46 for each National Commerce share. SunTrust plans to pay about $1.8 billion in cash and issue 
approximately 77.5 million shares of is own stock. 
SunTrust valued the deal at $6.98 billion, based on the price of SunTrust shares Friday. That's the same day 
speculation surfaced that SunTrust and three other banking companies would bid for National Commerce.

The others named in published reports were Fifth Third Bancorp, a Cincinnati-based company that has been 
moving south, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, and Royal Bank of Canada. 
On Sunday, CEO Humann said that serious talks between SunTrust and National Commerce started about a 
month ago. 
The purchase of National Commerce and its $23 billion in assets would push SunTrust back into the ranks of the 
10 largest banking companies in the United States. SunTrust said the merger would give it $148 billion in assets 
and make it the seventh-largest banking company. 
The deal still requires shareholder and regulatory approval, and is expected to be completed late this year.

ATLANTA (AP) - SunTrust Banks Inc. said administrative positions could be affected but it doesn't expect 
significant job cuts from its nearly $7 billion purchase of National Commerce Financial Corp., which is known for 
its outlets in supermarkets and retail stores. 
Shares of both banking companies fell Monday on news of the cash and stock deal. 
The deal announced Sunday would make SunTrust the nation's seventh-largest bank with $148 billion in assets 
and $97 billion in deposits. 
SunTrust spokesman Barry Koling said there will be job cuts among the companies' 33,000 employees, mostly in 
back-office functions, such as administrative and operational positions. 
Specifics are still being worked out, but Koling indicated the number won't be significant. 
"I don't think we're talking thousands," he said. 
Management changes are expected as well, but executives at Atlanta-based SunTrust and Memphis, 
Tennessee-based NCF would not go into details during a conference call with analysts on Monday. The 
companies said Sunday that no branch-based job eliminations will result from any branch consolidations. 
NCF president and chief executive William R. Reed Jr. will be a member of SunTrust's policy and management 
committees, but beyond that his exact role at the merged company has not been determined, said SunTrust 
chairman and chief executive L. Phillip Humann. Four NCF board members will john SunTrust's board, Humann 
said. 
Shares of SunTrust fell $5.08, or 7.6 percent, to close at $61.80 on the New York Stock Exchange, where shares 
of National Commerce Financial fell 70 cents to $31.10. 
Humann said the deal, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, would expand SunTrust's reach 
in the South and provide strong growth potential, especially in the supermarket and retail store segment where 
NCF specializes with in-store ATM machines and banking centers. The combined bank will operate as SunTrust. 
"If we didn't have the best footprint in banking before, I think you could make the case that we do now," Humann 
said. 
NCF is the holding company for National Bank of Commerce, Central Carolina Bank & Trust and NBC Bank. It 
operates in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia, Virginia and West 
Virginia. 
National Bank of Commerce has had branches in Wal-Mart stores since 1991. In a two-year test program begun 
last fall, some branches in Georgia and Tennessee have been operating under the name Wal-Mart Money 
Centers. 
SunTrust operates in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia and the District of Columbia.

SunTrust doesn't expect significant job cuts in NCF acquisition

ATLANTA (AP) - SunTrust Banks Inc. said administrative positions could be affected but it doesn't expect 
significant job cuts from its nearly $7 billion purchase of National Commerce Financial Corp., which is known for 
its outlets in supermarkets and retail stores. 
Shares of both banking companies fell Monday on news of the cash and stock deal. 
The deal announced Sunday would make SunTrust the nation's seventh-largest bank with $148 billion in assets 
and $97 billion in deposits. 
SunTrust spokesman Barry Koling said there will be job cuts among the companies' 33,000 employees, mostly in 
back-office functions, such as administrative and operational positions. 
Specifics are still being worked out, but Koling indicated the number won't be significant. 
"I don't think we're talking thousands," he said. 
Jeff K. Davis, an analyst with FTN Midwest Research in Nashville, said he expects NCF's offices in Memphis and 
Durham, N.C., to be hit particularly hard. 
"There will be expense reductions that will mostly be born by National Commerce," Davis said. "How many folks 
that will be, who knows?" 
Management changes are expected as well, but executives at Atlanta-based SunTrust and Memphis, 
Tenn.-based NCF would not go into details during a conference call with analysts on Monday. The companies 
said Sunday that no branch-based job eliminations will result from any branch consolidations. 
NCF president and chief executive William R. Reed Jr. will be a member of SunTrust's policy and management 
committees, but beyond that his exact role at the merged company has not been determined, said SunTrust 
chairman and chief executive L. Phillip Humann. Four NCF board members will john SunTrust's board, Humann 
said. 
Shares of SunTrust fell $5.08, or 7.6 percent, to close at $61.80 on the New York Stock Exchange, where shares 
of National Commerce Financial fell 70 cents to close at $31.10. 
Humann said the deal, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, would expand SunTrust's reach 
in the South and provide strong growth potential, especially in the supermarket and retail store segment where 
NCF specializes with in-store ATM machines and banking centers. The combined bank will operate as SunTrust. 
"If we didn't have the best footprint in banking before, I think you could make the case that we do now," Humann 
said. 
NCF is the holding company for National Bank of Commerce, Central Carolina Bank & Trust and NBC Bank. It 
operates in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia, Virginia and West 
Virginia.

Later this week, customers will be able to use ATMs of either bank without a usage fee.

recently completed its $47 billion acquisition of FleetBoston Financial Corp., and the proposed $58 billion merger 
of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank One Corp. is pending. 
In January, Regions Financial Corp. and Union Planters Corp. agreed to merge in a $6 billion deal that creates a 
Southeastern banking powerhouse. The same month, Huntington Bancshares Inc. announced plans to acquire 
Unizan Financial Corp. in a stock deal the two companies valued at $587 million. 
Davis, the analyst, said the NCF deal makes sense for SunTrust because it helps the company round out its 
geographic base in the South. At the same time, he said he was surprised NCF decided to sell out before 
expanding its presence in Wal-Mart stores and in the Atlanta market. 
"We're scratching our heads saying, 'Why now?'" Davis said.

WASHINGTON, May 9 (AFP) - 
SunTrust Banks and National Commerce Financial Corporation have reached a seven-billion-dollar merger

The combined company will have 148 billion dollars in assets, 97 billion dollars in deposits and will have 1,723 
full-service offices in 11 states plus the District of Columbia.

The transaction involves approximately 1.8 billion dollars in cash and approximately 77.5 million SunTrust shares. 
"National Commerce, with its great franchise, talented people and high standards, is a superb fit for SunTrust," 
said Phillip Humann, SunTrust chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Our companies complement 
each other perfectly in terms of customer focus, geographic coverage and business orientation." 
National Commerce Financial Corporation President and CEO William Reed said he expected customers to 
have access to a deeper and broader array of products and services in a larger geographic footprint. 
The combined company board of directors will have 18 members, made up of SunTrust's existing 14 directors 
plus four new directors from National Commerce. 
SunTrust said it anticipates that the combined company can reduce annual operating expenses by approximately 
117 million dollars, or 20 percent of NCF's total expense base.

ATLANTA and MEMPHIS, Tenn., May 9 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- SunTrust Banks, Inc. and National Commerce 
Financial Corporation announced today the signing of a definitive merger agreement, leading to the creation of 
an incomparable financial services franchise concentrated in the fast-growing, demographically strong 
Southeastern United States. 
The combined company, which will operate as SunTrust, will have the highest growth geographic "footprint" 
among the top 20 US banks. It will rank number three in overall market share in the Southeast, with a top five 
ranking in 20 of the 25 largest high-growth markets in the region. SunTrust will rank as the seventh-largest US 
bank with $148 billion in assets, $97 billion in deposits, and 1,723 full-service offices in 11 states plus the District 
of Columbia. 
The merger, which is subject to approval by regulatory authorities and by shareholders of both companies, is 
expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2004. The merger is expected to be cash accretive to SunTrust earnings 
immediately and GAAP accretive beginning in 2006. 
Under the terms of the definitive agreement, which has been approved by both boards of directors, National 
Commerce shareholders will have the right, subject to proration, to elect to receive cash or SunTrust common 
stock, in either case having a value equal to $8.625 plus .3713 SunTrust shares. Based on the price of STI 
shares at the close of business on Friday May 7, 2004, the transaction is valued at $33.46 per NFC share, for a 
total transaction value of $6.98 billion. The total consideration consists of approximately $1.8 billion in cash and 
approximately 77.5 million SunTrust shares. 
"National Commerce, with its great franchise, talented people and high standards, is a superb fit for SunTrust. 
Our companies complement each other perfectly in terms of customer focus, geographic coverage and business 
orientation," said L. Phillip Humann, SunTrust Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Humann 
noted that "this merger also demonstrates how SunTrust's deliberate and highly selective approach to mergers 
and acquisitions is supportive of our institutional focus on growth opportunities, superior financial performance 
and enhanced shareholder value." 
"This merger means great things for NCF employees, for our shareholders and especially for our customers," said 
William R. Reed, Jr., NCF President and Chief Executive Officer. "From a cultural perspective, SunTrust operates 
a similar banking model of regional banks, with local decision-making that keeps the bankers in tune with and 
responsive to customers' needs. Customers will have access to a deeper and broader array of products and 
services in a larger geographic footprint. They'll continue to see the benefits of our merger as we couple the 
strengths of SunTrust with the high entrepreneurial energy of NCF, with a sustained focus on retail growth, 
community banking, operating efficiency, asset quality and continued investment in de novo opportunities. And 
because there is little overlap between our footprints, our customers will continue to do business with the people 
they know and trust." 
The combined company board of directors will have 18 members, made up of SunTrust's existing 14 directors 
plus four new directors from National Commerce. Mr. Reed will continue in his current capacity until the 
transaction closes; at that time, he will assume a senior executive role within the combined organization. It is 
anticipated that other members of NCF's executive management team will also play significant roles in the postmerger 
environment. 
The companies said that "ensuring smooth integration and continuity in customer service is merger priority 
number one." To that end a comprehensive merger integration process has been established, with experienced 
leadership from both organizations, to draw upon each partner's success in prior merger integrations. As an early

illustration of the combined company's customer orientation, SunTrust and NCF customers will, beginning later 
this week, be able to use ATMs of either bank without any usage fee. 
SunTrust said it anticipates that the combined company can reduce annual operating expenses by approximately 
$117 million, or 20 percent of NCF's total expense base. Approximately 60 percent of those savings would be 
realized in 2005, with 100 percent realized beginning in 2006. 
SunTrust and National Commerce said that cost reductions will come primarily from careful consolidation of 
various administrative and back-office functions. The companies noted that with limited overlap in their 
geographic banking networks, no branch-based job eliminations will result from any merger-related branch 
consolidations. The companies said they anticipated that a "substantial majority" of other job eliminations would 
be achieved through normal attrition. 
Senior management will present details of the merger on a conference call on May 10, 2004 at 10:00 a.m. 
(Eastern Time). Individuals are encouraged to call in beginning at 9:45 a.m. by dialing 1-888-822-9863

UPDATE 2-SunTrust to acquire National Commerce for $7 bln. 
UPDATE 2-SunTrust to acquire National Commerce for $7 bln.

(Updates with details on bidding for National Commerce, merger trends in U.S. banking; adds byline) 
NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - SunTrust Banks Inc. said on Sunday it agreed to acquire National Commerce 
Financial Corp. for nearly $7 billion in cash and stock, bolstering the bank's footprint in the fast-growing 
southeastern United States. 
The deal,mand marks the first major acquisition by Atlanta-based SunTrust since it lost a bidding war for 
Wachovia Corp. to rival First Union in 2001. 
It also becomes the latest billion-dollar merger announced in the deal-hungry U.S. banking sector this year. With 
nearly 10,000 banks and thrifts nationwide, the U.S. banking sector remains one of the world's most fragmented, 
a fact analysts believe should bring several more significant deals as large U.S. and foreign banks look to offset 
slowing revenue streams. 
"Our companies complement each other perfectly in terms of customer focus, geographic coverage and business 
orientation," said Philip Humann, SunTrust's chairman and chief executive officer. "This merger also 
demonstrates how SunTrust's deliberative and highly selective approach to mergers ... is supportive of our 
institutional focus on growth opportunities, superior financial performance and enhanced shareholder value." 
A NATURAL FIT 
SunTrust said the deal presented natural synergies because it expanded the bank's geographic reach without a 
significant overlap of branches while adding an institution that promoted a similar regional banking model. 
Still, SunTrust faced stiff competition to buy National Commerce, based in Memphis, Tennessee, from Fifth Third 
Bancorp, according to sources familiar with the situation. 
Fifth Third, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, has started to aggressively pursue acquisitions again after emerging 
recently from a regulatory imposed moratorium on acquisitions and, analysts noted, it has been particularly 
interested in expanding into Tennessee. 
That helped drive the price for National Commerce up during the last week, sources noted, resulting in a fairly rich 
acquisition price. 
Terms of the transaction call for SunTrust to pay the equivalent of $8.625 in cash and 0.3713 of a share of its 
stock for each National Commerce share. Based on closing stock prices Friday, that values National Commerce 
at nearly $33.46 per share - a 5.2 percent premium above the company's closing stock price of $31.80 on Friday. 
SunTrust's stock closed Friday at $66.88. 
National Commerce shares jumped 13 percent on Friday after the Financial Times, Reuters and other news 
organizations reported the bank was being courted as a takeover target by both SunTrust and Fifth Third. 
SunTrust said the deal would add to its cash earnings immediately by an undisclosed amount, and be accretive to 
its GAAP earnings, or earnings based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, in 2006. 
The companies expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year.

Page 86 of 89 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The deal comes on the heels of the Royal Bank of Scotland'sagreement last week to acquire Charter One 
Financial, based in Cleveland, for $10.5 billion in cash, significantly expanding the U.K. bank's presence in the 
United States. 
Several leading U.S. banks, including Bank of America Corp.and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., have already either 
announced or closed major acquisitions this year. to continue generating revenue and earnings growth in the face 
of rising interest rates.

ATLANTA (AP) - SunTrust Banks Inc. said Sunday it was buying Memphis-based National Commerce Financial 
Corp. in a nearly $7 billion cash-and-stock deal, the latest merger in the wave of consolidation sweeping the 
financial sector. 
The companies said the combination, which followed a reported bidding war between Atlanta-based SunTrust 
and Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp., would create the seventh-largest U.S bank, with $148 billion in assets 
and $97 billion in deposits. 
Under the terms of the $6.98 billion deal announced Sunday, NCF shareholders would receive $8.625 plus 
0.3713 SunTrust share for each NCF share. Based on SunTrust's closing price Friday, the transaction is valued at 
$33.46 per NFC share -- a 5.2 percent premium above NCF's closing price on Friday. NCF shares surged 13 
percent to $31.80 Friday on speculation a deal was imminent. 
The pricetag includes $1.8 billion in cash with the balance in stock -- approximately 77.5 million SunTrust shares. 
"National Commerce, with its great franchise, talented people and high standards, is a superb fit for SunTrust," 
SunTrust chairman and chief executive L. Phillip Humann said. "Our companies complement each other perfectly 
in terms of customer focus, geographic coverage and business orientation." 
A conference call with investors and analysts was scheduled for Monday morning. 
The merger follows a string of combinations in the national and regional banking business. Bank of America Corp. 
recently completed its $47 billion acquisition of FleetBoston Financial Corp., and the proposed $58 billion merger 
of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank One Corp. is pending. 
In January, Regions Financial Corp. and Union Planters Corp. agreed to merge in a $6 billion deal that creates a 
Southeastern banking powerhouse. The same month, Huntington Bancshares Inc. announced plans to acquire 
Unizan Financial Corp. in a stock deal the two companies valued at $587 million. 
Analysts had previously said NCF stood to benefit from a combination with either SunTrust or Fifth Third, since 
each offered access to customers in different regions. Published reports last week had speculated Fifth Third and 
SunTrust were offering at least $6 billion. At the time, SunTrust and Fifth Third both declined to comment. 
In a news release, the companies did not offer specifics about any job cuts. But the banks said that it anticipated 
"no branch-based job eliminations" and that a "substantial majority" of other job cuts would occur through attrition.

ATLANTA (AP) - SunTrust Banks Inc. said Sunday it was buying Memphis-based National Commerce Financial 
Corp. in a nearly $7 billion cash-and-stock deal, the latest merger in the wave of consolidation sweeping the 
financial sector. 
The companies said the combination, which followed a reported bidding war between Atlanta-based SunTrust 
and Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp., would create the seventh-largest U.S bank, with $148 billion in assets 
and $97 billion in deposits. 
Under the terms of the $6.98 billion deal announced Sunday, NCF shareholders would receive $8.625 plus 
0.3713 SunTrust share for each NCF share. Based on SunTrust's closing price Friday, the transaction is valued at 
$33.46 per NFC share -- a 5.2 percent premium above NCF's closing price on Friday. NCF shares surged 13 
percent to $31.80 Friday on speculation a deal was imminent. 
The pricetag includes $1.8 billion in cash with the balance in stock -- approximately 77.5 million SunTrust shares. 
"National Commerce, with its great franchise, talented people and high standards, is a superb fit for SunTrust," 
SunTrust chairman and chief executive L. Phillip Humann said. "Our companies complement each other perfectly 
in terms of customer focus, geographic coverage and business orientation." 
A conference call with investors and analysts was scheduled for Monday morning. 
The merger follows a string of combinations in the national and regional banking business. Bank of America Corp. 
recently completed its $47 billion acquisition of FleetBoston Financial Corp., and the proposed $58 billion merger 
of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank One Corp. is pending. 
In January, Regions Financial Corp. and Union Planters Corp. agreed to merge in a $6 billion deal that creates a 
Southeastern banking powerhouse. The same month, Huntington Bancshares Inc. announced plans to acquire 
Unizan Financial Corp. in a stock deal the two companies valued at $587 million. 
Analysts had previously said NCF stood to benefit from a combination with either SunTrust or Fifth Third, since 
each offered access to customers in different regions. Published reports last week had speculated Fifth Third and 
SunTrust were offering at least $6 billion. At the time, SunTrust and Fifth Third both declined to comment. 
Messages left Sunday seeking comment from Fifth Third were not immediately returned. 
In a news release, the companies did not offer specifics about any job cuts. But the banks said that it anticipated 
"no branch-based job eliminations" and that a "substantial majority" of other job cuts would occur through attrition. 
The new organization will have 1,723 full-service offices in 11 states plus the District of Columbia. 
NCF is the holding company for National Bank of Commerce, Central Carolina Bank & Trust and NBC Bank. It 
operates in Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia, Virginia and West Virginia. 
National Bank of Commerce has had branches in Wal-Mart stores since 1991. In a two-year test program begun 
last fall, some branches in Georgia and Tennessee have been operating under the name Wal-Mart Money 
Centers. 
SunTrust operates in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia and the District of Columbia.

The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close by the end of the year. Later this week, 
customers will be able to use ATMs of either bank without a usage fee. 
"From a cultural perspective, SunTrust operates a similar banking model of regional banks, with local 
decision-making that keeps the bankers in tune with and responsive to customers' needs," NCF president and 
chief executive officer William R. Reed Jr. said. "Customers will have access to a deeper and broader array of 
products and services in a larger geographic footprint."
