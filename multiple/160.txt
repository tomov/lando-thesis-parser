Pepsi gets two deals as Coke gets egg on its face. Have fortunes really shifted in the cola wars? 
It looked like a portrait of fierce competitors going in opposite directions. 
In quick succession, PepsiCo rattled off two acquisitions in November and December, snaring two of the hottest 
brands in the beverage business. PepsiCo bought SoBe for $370 million in November. Then, in a much bigger 
deal, PepsiCo agreed to acquire Quaker Oats Co. for $14 billion in cash and stock in December, winning 
Gatorade--leader in the isotonic beverage market--in the process and putting to rest years of takeover 
speculation. 
Coca-Cola Co. was a bidder in each case, only to be beaten out for South Beach Beverage Co. and to withdraw 
from a seemingly done deal with Quaker after its board, led by uber-financier Warren Buffett, overruled chairman 
and chief executive officer Douglas Daft. 
Pepsi hasn't just been winning the acquisition battles. The company has picked up market share in the U.S. 
carbonated beverage market, beaten Coke in orange juice and bottled water and taken a commanding lead in the 
faster-growing non-carbonated beverage business. 
Pepsi continues to expand acclaimed advertising for its flagship brand around the world. Coca-Cola's Daft, after 
pronouncing a new "think local, act local" dictum for what had been one of the world's most global marketers, 
scuttled the first U.S. incarnation of his philosophy this fall after consumers voiced displeasure with the irreverent 
approach. Then, he signed up Interpublic Group to develop global brand strategies. 
Coca-Cola's board, having deposed former CEO Douglas Ivester in December 1999 in favor of Daft, pulled the 
plug on the Quaker Oats deal Daft negotiated. Despite his reputation as a serial CEO killer, having also presided 
over the firing of Gillette's CEO in September, Buffett said Daft remains in charge. But Don Keough, a longtime 
friend of Buffett's and former CEO, has re-entered the picture as a close adviser to Daft. 
At PepsiCo, the question of who's in charge hasn't come up. Having spearheaded a restructuring that saw 
PepsiCo emerge from doldrums of its own by spinning off its restaurant businesses, CEO Roger Enrico basks in 
positive media attention. Though PepsiCo sales of $21 billion are a third lower than when Enrico took over in 
1996, profits are $100 million higher. 
"Coke has a lot of seal searching to do in terms of how it's going to compose its package if it's going to continue 
to grow into the world marketplace and be the dominant soft drink company," says Tom Pirko, president of 
consulting firm Bevmark LLC and an adviser, from time to time, for each company. "Self-confidence in this 
business is extremely important, because it just trickles down from (headquarters) all the way to bottlers to buyers 
in the stores. Pepsi is sort of bright and shiny now. Coke is in the shadows, and they need to get out." 
Coke remains a beverage behemoth, to be sure. It still leads the U.S. and global carbonated beverage 
categories. But its share in the United States is slipping--down from 36.2 percent to 35.1 percent for the 10 
months ended in October, compared with the prior year, according to Merrill Lynch. Pepsi gained marginally, from 
31.4 percent to 31.5 percent. 
And the carbonated share figures mask Pepsi's much stronger showing in non-carbonated beverages, where its 
combined share, including single-serve waters and chilled juices, is now 1.5 times that of No. 2 Coke, following 
the acquisitions of SoBe and Gatorade. Even before that, Pepsi's Aquafina had established a clear lead over 
Coke's Dasani in bottled water, as had Pepsi's Tropicana over Coke's Minute Maid. Strength in non-carbs is

crucial, says Merrill Lynch analyst David Lane, because the 7 to 8 percent annual growth rate in non-carbonated 
beverages is about three times as fast as that in carbonated beverages. 
The cola wars have shifted to decidedly un-cola territory, and Pepsi, which could never beat Coke in soft drinks, 
has the upper hand on the new battleground. 
"Pepsi has set itself up to have tremendous return on invested capital and profitable sales growth, while 
Coca-Cola is really going to struggle to grow, particularly given that Pepsi is going to be a significant to dominant 
player in every other beverage segment," says Burt Flickinger, managing director of Reach Marketing, Westport, 
Conn. 
But Ken Harris, partner with Cannondale Associates, Evanston, Ill., says the apparent reversal of fortunes is more 
perception than reality. After all, it was only a few years ago that the team of former Coca-Cola CEO Roberto 
Goizueta, Ivester and former chief marketing officer Sergio Zyman had Coke on top of the world and Pepsi on the 
ropes. 
"You've got two very strong competitors," Harris says. "I think Pepsi was weaker. Now it's stronger. They hate 
each other equally as much today as they did 10 years ago. And they're going to continue to slug it out. As long 
as you've got the strength of people like Warren Buffett, and it's pretty clear Don Keough is making his presence 
known again, I don't think you're going to see either side giving an inch. And I don't think the latest purchase wars 
necessarily signal anything different." 
Pepsi has the challenge of effectively integrating Quaker and SoBe and of doing something Quaker was only 
modestly successful at--expanding Gatorade overseas. And the story of Quaker's conversion of Snapple from a 
$1.7 billion acquisition to a $309 million divestiture in three years shows that buying trendy beverage brands like 
SoBe can be risky. 
"SoBe could not have sold at a better time," Harris says. "There are questions now about the whole herbal 
additive thing. Even the people who were hepped up on it realize there are such trace elements (in the drinks) 
that it really doesn't amount to anything." 
Coke is under pressure to develop some new brands, Harris says, but he doesn't believe Pepsi has done that 
much to tip the balance of power in beverages. 
But others doubt that Coke, or any of the big beverage companies, can effectively develop their own major brands 
from scratch. Pepsi's own struggles getting the PepsiOne extension off the ground are evidence of that, Pirko 
says. 
"Big companies have a very hard time creating new brands themselves," he says. "Coke has a long and dismal 
history of creating new products. The big companies are slow. They're getting better. They're learning they have 
to abandon the old plodding ways and taking a year to test and write your budget. There's still no demonstrated 
capacity to start hitting with winners on smaller brands and bringing them forward." 
Pepsi's acquisitions have significantly winnowed the field of attractive beverage acquisitions, Pirko says. He and 
Flickinger do expect the Ocean Spray cooperative, which includes the Nantucket Nectars brand, to become even 
more attractive to someone--possibly Coke. Hansen Beverage Co., another marketer of alternative beverages, 
could be another possibility, Pirko says. 
Jones Soda Co., the Seattle-based maker of cult favorites Jones Soda, Jones Whoopass sports drink and Wazu 
mineral water, may also enter the radar of the bigger players. Asked earlier this year to name the two best 
marketed brands, former Nike and Starbucks marketing guru Scott Bedbury cited Volkswagen and Jones Soda. 
With Jones Soda's sales currently on pace to top $60 million a year and growing at 85 percent annually, Jones 
president-CEO Peter Van Stolk says, "We haven't proven ourselves to the extent we want to yet." But he says 
following SoBe's acquisition, Jones is now the fastest-growing independent beverage company. And with SoBe 
leaving independent beverage distribution, Van Stolk is moving to fill the void early in 2001 by launching Jones 
Juice, a functional juice-based beverage line that takes a fun approach similar to Jones Soda, he says. Among its 
offerings: Key Lime with Hemp. 
"In today's competitive environment, it's very expensive for companies to create brands," Van Stolk says. "I do 
believe companies will be looked at to be acquired earlier than they've ever been, due to the competitive nature of 
the industry."

PURCHASE, N.Y. -- PepsiCo Inc. struck a deal early last month to acquire Quaker Oats Co. for about $13.4 
billion in stock, ending what had become a bidding war for the Chicagobased company and its muchcoveted 
Gatorade sports drink brand. 
PepsiCo's agreement with Quaker Oats calls for it to exchange 2.3 shares -- at about $42 a share -- of its stock 
for each existing Quaker share. 
The deal, which has basically the same terms as a PepsiCo offer that was rejected in November, ends months of 
speculation about the fate of Quaker Oats. 
After PepsiCo's initial bid was spurned Coca-Cola Co. made a preliminary bid for Quaker Oats, only to have 
Coke's board of directors block the deal, Subsequently, Danone of France explored the possibility of trying to 
acquire Quaker Oats but eventually abandoned its efforts. 
The PepsiCo bid that was accepted by Quaker Oats differs in one important respect from the company's original 
takeover offer. Under the deal finalized by both companies' boards the merger can be called off if PepsiCo's stock 
drops to less than $40 a share (producing a $92-a-share price for Quaker Oats stock) for at least 10 days during 
the final month before the deal closes. 
On the other hand, if PepsiCo's stock price goes above $45.65 a share (producing a $105-a-share price for 
Quaker Oats stock), Quaker Oats shareholders would receive no more than $105 a share. 
"This will be a truly outstanding combination," comments PepsiCo chairman and chief executive officer Roger 
Enrico, who also announced that several management changes would occur when the deal closed. 
"Bringing together Quaker and PepsiCo creates a wealth of exciting growth opportunities, as well as important 
cost and selling synergies. It is also very consistent with our sharp focus on convenience food and beverages." 
The major factor that made Quaker Oats so attractive to PepsiCo and the other bidders was Gatorade. With an 
increasing number of consumers forsaking carbonated soft drinks in favor of bottled water, herbal teas and juice 
drinks, soft drink companies have been scrambling either to buy the industry's top-selling noncarbonated brands 
or to develop their own. 
PepsiCo already owns Aquafina, the top-selling brand of bottled water, as well as Lipton iced tea and 
Frappuccino iced coffee. 
Adding Gatorade to its stable will nearly double PepsiCo's share of the noncarbonated beverage market to 33% 
from 18%. Coca-Cola has a 21% share. 
Quaker Oats chairman Robert Morrison says he is pleased with the deal and sees the combined strength of the 
companies helping PepsiCo's sales and marketing efforts around the world. 
"Over the last three years," he notes, 'Quaker Oats Co. has outpaced the growth of the United States food and 
beverage industry. Combining with the world-renowned PepsiCo organization will unleash the tremendous global 
growth potential of the Gatorade brand and leverage the strengths of our food business." 
Among the management changes Enrico indicated would take place when the deal is finalized will be Morrison's 
elevation to vice chairman of PepsiCo with responsibility for the Quaker Oats business.

Steve Reinemund, PepsiCo's president and chief operating officer, who has been chosen to be Enrico's 
successor as chairman and chief executive officer, will assume those positions once the merger is completed. 
Enrico will become vice chairman, and PepsiCo's chief financial officer Indra Nooyi will assume the title of 
president and remain chief financial officer.

After Quaker acquisition, PepsiCo CFO to add president to title The move will elevate Indra Nooyi, one of 
the highest-ranking Indian-born women in Corporate America

On the Sunday morning that PepsiCo Inc. prepared to announce its $13.4-billion (U.S.) acquisition of Quaker 
Oats Co., Indra Nooyi boarded a plane for Pittsburgh. The PepsiCo chief financial officer was going to offer 
thanks at a Hindu temple modelled on one in southern India that members of her family used to visit when 
something big was happening in their lives. 
There's no doubt something big is happening in Ms. Nooyi's life. Not only did she play a key role in PepsiCo's 
proposed acquisition of Quaker, but she will become the beverage and snack-food giant's No. 2 executive, 
behind chairman and chief executive officer designate Steven Reinemund, when the deal closes next spring. 
As president and CFO, Ms. Nooyi, 45, will add oversight of legal affairs, human resources and corporate 
communications to responsibilities she already has for finance, strategic planning, and mergers and acquisitions. 
She will also be nominated for a seat on PepsiCo's board. 
The move elevates one of the highest-ranking Indian-born women in Corporate America. Ms. Nooyi joins a 
handful of other executives from her homeland who have climbed high in corporate ranks, including Rakesh 
Gangwal, CEO of US Airways Group Inc., the sixth-largest U.S. airline, and Rono Dutta, president of UAL Corp.'s 
United Airlines, the largest U.S. domestic carrier. 
Known as a smart business and financial strategist, Ms. Nooyi was one of the key executives behind PepsiCo's 
transformation from a diffuse conglomerate that included restaurants and bottling plants to a corporation focused 
on convenience foods and beverages. She plays down her promotion, saying that she has gradually been taking 
on new responsibilities since becoming CFO in February. The Purchase, N.Y.-based company's operations, 
including such brands as Pepsi, Tropicana and Frito-Lay, will report to Mr. Reinemund. 
But her move upward, together with that of Mr. Reinemund, who will become chairman and CEO ahead of 
schedule, puts two executives in charge who share a vision for the company. They want to be on the cutting edge 
as consumers demand foods and drinks that are consumed on the go. Acquiring Quaker -- with its Gatorade 
sports drinks and granola bar and rice cake snacks -- could help put them there. 
Mr. Reinemund is one of Ms. Nooyi's biggest fans. "She's been instrumental in everything we have done over the 
last five years," he says. "Not only is she good at everything she does, but she's a lot of fun." 
Though a self-professed workaholic, Ms. Nooyi likes to keep the mood light. She is known to sing around the 
executive office and keeps a karaoke machine at home. She once kept a "yes" man statuette on her desk at 
work; when touched, it made ingratiating utterances. 
In speeches, she uses humour to get her points across. Describing the hurried lifestyle that puts PepsiCo's 
products in demand, she once told an audience of investors and analysts that she hadn't realized how precious 
time was until a driver passed her on the highway flossing his teeth. 
Ms. Nooyi easily merges her Hindu roots with the life of a U.S. executive. Deeply religious, she has set aside an 
area of her Greenwich, Conn., home so that she can perform puja, or prayer. When she was named CFO, she 
told current PepsiCo chairman and CEO Roger Enrico that she needed time to go to India to the temple where

her family had always prayed. It took her a week after negotiations restarted between PepsiCo and Quaker to get 
to the Pittsburgh temple. She flew with her husband and daughter and made "a decent-sized offering," she says. 
Raised in a middle-class family in India, Ms. Nooyi came to the United States in 1978 to enroll in Yale University's 
graduate school of management. After Yale, she was hired by Boston Consulting Group, then held corporate 
strategy jobs at technology giant Motorola Inc. and at Asea Brown Boveri Inc. before joining PepsiCo as a senior 
vice-president of corporate strategy and development in 1994. 
PepsiCo was a far less focused company back then, and troubled international operations were hurting its 
credibility on Wall Street. Working closely with Mr. Enrico, she and other executives spun off the company's 
restaurant and bottling businesses. Ms. Nooyi then spearheaded one of Pepsi's most successful acquisitions: 
Tropicana. A devotee of the company's orange juice who used to squeeze her own before she discovered 
Tropicana, Ms. Nooyi was among the first at PepsiCo to see the brand's potential, both for PepsiCo's earnings 
and to enhance the company's developing portfolio of convenience and "functional" foods and drinks. When other 
PepsiCo executives continued to question the $3.3-billion acquisition at a final meeting, "Roger and I just told 
them, 'We are going to do it,' " she says. 
"Indra is extraordinarily financially detailed," says Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter. "With Tropicana, she was willing to take a lower-return-on-asset business because she saw a way to 
improve it to get strong margin growth. Her ability to find value in an acquisition is very high." 
Ms. Nooyi was the chief negotiator for PepsiCo on the Quaker deal. The negotiations with Quaker had their 
tense moments, as the two sides failed to reach an agreement last month and Coca-Cola Co. swooped in before 
backing out at the last minute. Later, a major sticking point arose when Ms. Nooyi insisted on a cap on the stock 
price of no more than $105 a share for Quaker shareholders. Ms. Nooyi and Mr. Enrico won plaudits for sticking 
to the original terms of their deal. "Throughout the whole process, she was disciplined and held very firm," says 
Steven Baronoff, co-head of mergers at Merrill Lynch, which represented PepsiCo. 
Concerned about how Wall Street would perceive a deal, she set growth targets for the new combined company 
that were more conservative than those analysts were estimating. "We have a financial discipline we're all very 
proud of," she says. 
Known for her humour, Ms. Nooyi also speaks her mind. Pepsi executives were forced to scrap an early version 
of the packaging for the company's new Sierra Mist lemon-lime soda when she said it reminded her of detergent, 
according to an executive. 
Ms. Nooyi agrees she can be tough. "I think I've got a human touch, but ultimately my interest is PepsiCo," she 
says. 
Ms. Nooyi says she will spend the next several months working with Mr. Reinemund to integrate Quaker and 
define new areas for growth. They will be joined by Mr. Enrico and Quaker's Robert Morrison, who will step help 
lead the effort as PepsiCo vice-chairmen. "If we integrate Quaker seamlessly, this is going to be a bigger home 
run than Tropicana," Ms. Nooyi says.

When PepsiCo Inc. and Quaker Oats Co. finally got together last week, investors on both sides of the deal 
breathed a gigantic sigh of relief. 
"This makes [PepsiCo] king of the non-carbonated drinks mountain," said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with ING 
Barings in San Francisco. "This is an acquisition made in heaven." 
The share price of both companies soared following the $13.4-billion (U.S.) stock swap, which brought the 
Gatorade line of sports drinks into the PepsiCo fold. And the stocks kept going up for the rest of the week. 
PepsiCo reached $47.06 on the New York Stock Exchange by the close yesterday, down on the day but up about 
$5 from its recent low after a previous attempt to buy Quaker fell through. Chicago-based Quaker soared to 
$93.94, also lower on the day but up from its recent low of $83 when it looked like nobody wanted the company. 
"This is one terrific moment in the history of PepsiCo and Quaker," Roger Enrico, PepsiCo's chairman and chief 
executive officer, reportedly told investors and analysts in a conference call. 
The offer that Quaker finally accepted on Dec. 4 was little different from the one it rejected a month ago -- 2.3 
PepsiCo shares for each one of Quaker. The only difference was a collar that Quaker shareholders requested to 
protect against a fall in the PepsiCo share price. 
Under the revised offer, the deal will be modified if PepsiCo shares fall below $40 or rise above $45.65. In 
addition, PepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., has agreed to pick up $500-million of Quaker's debt. 
PepsiCo's shares are unlikely to fall below the $40 floor, judging by the near euphoria among analysts. 
Bloomberg has surveyed seven analysts since the deal was announced and six rated PepsiCo stock a "buy," 
"strong buy" or "recommend." The sixth, Timothy Swanson of A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, is sticking 
with a "maintain position." 
Most of the analysts have lifted their earnings estimates and target prices in light of the deal, and most expect 
Gatorade to contribute to PepsiCo's bottom line within the year. 
"We really like the deal," said Patrick Schumann of Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis. "It gives them a fantastic 
brand [Gatorade] with lots of momentum and synergies on the snack-food side." 
The analysts expect Mr. Enrico to benefit from Quaker's management expertise. "It's a very strong management 
team" at Quaker, Mr. Schumann added. "It's a win-win for Pepsi shareholders. I'm very optimistic." 
PepsiCo's real prize is Gatorade, which dominates the $2.5-billion sports drink market. "Gatorade is the market 
leader in the room-temperature-drinks aisle," Mr. Goldman said. "It can now leverage Tropicana." Tropicana is a 
PepsiCo company that also produces shelf-stable drinks. 
But there are also clear synergies from the deal. The companies can share trucks, distribution systems and sales 
networks. More importantly, PepsiCo is a market leader in soft drinks, fruit juices and snack foods; Quaker is a

Page 13 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
market leader in Gatorade and snack foods. The two product lines are very strong and they are complementary, 
with little overlap. 
"Pepsi is very big in snacks," Mr. Goldman said. "They have layered on Tropicana and added a new layer with 
Gatorade. These are super brands." 
And in a business where might is right, PepsiCo's enormous market share in the soft drink, fruit drink and snack 
food markets means the company has some real muscle power when it comes time to negotiate with the 
supermarket chains. 
"Quaker adds size," added George Thompson of Prudential Securities Research in New York. "This makes Pepsi 
that much stronger when dealing with supermarkets." 
Mr. Goldman added: "They need the supermarkets and the supermarkets need them." 
There are other, more subtle advantages to the deal. Ms. Levy talked about a psychological boost in the endless 
war with Coca-Cola Co. and a powerful weapon in the battle to win over consumers and retailers. 
But even without the Quaker acquisition, PepsiCo was a very strong company under Mr. Enrico's direction. Mr. 
Thompson has had a "strong buy" recommendation on PepsiCo for more than a month, one which he said "is not 
related to the Quaker deal. It's the basic strength of the business." 
PepsiCo is already strong, he said, in soft drinks, fruit juices, bottled water and snacks, while the Quaker 
purchase just adds more strength to a solid company. 
As with any merger, the analysts offered a few cautions among the accolades. Mr. Thompson reminded investors 
that PepsiCo has no use for Quaker's porridge, famous as it is. "Cereals will be sold in two years," he predicted. 
PepsiCo will probably have to sell its existing line of All-Sport drinks to satisfy antitrust regulators. "If anybody 
wants to buy it," one analyst quipped. 
But All-Sport is such a small part of Quaker's business -- only 3 per cent of sales -- that it will hardly be missed. 
The analysts also cautioned investors not to expect too much too soon. It will take a year or two for the 
companies to merge, and longer for the synergies to show. Even then, many of the synergies that appear obvious 
at first glance may never come about. 
The reason is that soft drinks are a bizarre business, which handles product in a completely different manner from 
just about anything else. Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo typically don't bottle, distribute or sell their own pop; 
instead, they farm out their operations to independent franchisees. Gatorade, Tropicana and the snacks, 
however, are distributed and sold like foods, through a complex warehouse system. Bottom Line: Consumers 
may eventually see Gatorade and Tropicana pop out of Pepsi vending machines and colas on the Gatorade truck, 
but it won't happen any time soon. 
But such details are too picayune to dampen the enthusiasm on Wall Street.

PepsiCo Inc. agreed to acquire Quaker Oats Co., the maker of Cap'n Crunch cereal, Aunt Jemima pancake 
products and Gatorade, in a deal worth $13.4 billion in stock. Adding the popular Gatorade to its fleet of 
non-carbonated beverages -- which includes Aquafina water, Lipton teas and Tropicana juices -- will give 
PepsiCo control of the dominant brand in the $2.5 billion sports drink category. The boards of both companies 
approved the deal, but it is still subject to regulatory approval. 
Combining PepsiCo and Quaker will create a company with an exceptionally strong position in the rapidly 
growing market for convenient foods and beverages. The combined company, which will retain the PepsiCo 
name, will have revenues of $25 billion. Its expected market capitalization of more than $80 billion will place it 
among the world's five largest consumer products companies. 
When the deal closes there will be several personnel changes. Steve Reinemund, PepsiCo president and chief 
operating officer, will succeed Chairman and CEO Roger Enrico. Chief Financial Officer Indra Nooyi will add the 
title of president. Quaker Chairman and CEO Robert Morrison, will become a vice chairman of the combined 
company. 
At least two PepsiCo rivals had a similar thirst to acquire Quaker Oats: the board of Coca-Cola Co. abandoned 
talks to buy Quaker for a reported $15.75 billion a few weeks ago and French food conglomerate Danone SA 
backed away from a possible bid. In the end, PepsiCo beat out its competitors with an offer that essentially 
mirrored the one rejected by Quaker roughly one month ago. 
With the purchase of Quaker, PepsiCo also boosts its presence in the noncarbonated beverage markets of 
Europe and Asia, analysts said. However, the deal could raise antitrust concerns because of PepsiCo's 
ownership of AllSport, a competing brand to Gatorade, albeit with much less market share. However, PepsiCo 
has agreed to get rid of All-Sport in order to keep die deal alive. 
While picking up Gatorade was no doubt the primary thrust of this transaction for PepsiCo, analysts were quick to 
point out that Quaker Oats' food products, which include granola snack bars and rice cakes, nicely complement 
PepsiCo's line of savory snacks from its Frito-Lay Inc. division. Quaker's vast food business also includes such 
brands as Quaker and Life cereals, and Rice-A-Roni.

Get the rice -- better make it rice cakes -- ready: PepsiCo and Quaker Oats are finally getting hitched. Unable to 
land a better offer, Quaker last week agreed to Pepsi's original bid to exchange 2.3 Pepsi shares for each 
Quaker Oats share. The deal currently values Quaker at $14.2 billion, or about $109 a share, although it contains 
a provision capping Pepsi's cost at $105 a share. 
Pepsi's shares shot up more than five points to 47.50 on the week as management led by outgoing Chairman 
Roger Enrico hit the road to sell investors on a story whose major plot line revolves around Pepsi's ability to 
leverage Quaker's Gatorade sports-drink franchise across multiple distribution channels. At the same time, Pepsi 
hopes to integrate Quaker's fast-growing snack-foods division into its Frito-Lay unit, the world leader in salty 
snacks, which accounted for roughly two-thirds of Pepsi's 1999 sales and operating earnings. 
Pepsi expects the deal to boost earnings per share by almost one percentage point, to 13%-14%, and produce 
cost-savings synergies of at least $230 million. One institutional investor who met with Enrico called these targets 
"conservative and beatable." While the buyout price, which valued Quaker at 31 times 2000 estimated earnings, 
was rich, he says, "you couldn't get Gatorade on the cheap." 
According to PepsiCo CFO Indra Nooyi, who will also become president when the deal closes next spring, Pepsi 
first started looking at Gatorade five or six years ago. Two years ago, the company took a closer look, but didn't 
get serious until late '99 as its own five-year makeover neared completion. At that point, says Nooyi, "we wanted 
a few quarters of solid performance behind us, and our currency -- that is, our stock price -- to reflect our 
underlying value." The wait proved worthwhile: Pepsi's shares are up 35% year-to-date, and have risen 15% 
since Barron's examined the company's prospects in a favorable cover story ("Chipping Away," June 12). 
Few would argue with Nooyi that Gatorade gives Pepsi a "fantastic leg up" in non-carbonated beverages, the 
more so because the company triumphed, despite its lesser bid, over archrival Coca-Cola. Noncarbonated soft 
drinks represent only 28% of the market, but the category is growing 8%-9% a year, about three or four times 
faster than carbonated drinks. Prudential Securities analyst John McMillin thinks Pepsi could get an immediate 
10%-15% lift in sales by selling Gatorade through non-supermarket channels. "The combination of Gatorade and 
Aquafina [Pepsi's No. 1 bottled-water brand] in vending machines is a nobrainer," Nooyi says. 
So, too, are the possibilities for exploiting Quaker's snack-foods products, which include rice cakes and energy, 
granola and fruit bars. "The bars market is a $2 billion opportunity growing at 9% a year," says Nooyi. Ricebased 
snacks, on the other hand, provide Frito-Lay a new grain platform, and could prove particularly helpful in growing 
the company's Latin American business. 
Pepsi is precluded by accounting rules from selling Quaker's $2.5 billion cereal business for two years following 
the merger. "It will last two years and a day and then will be sold for a good price," McMillin says. In the 
meantime, the business boasts 17%-18% operating margins, and Pepsi hopes to use its cash flow to fund a 
welter of innovations in the company's core products.

COMPANIES &FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Coke head questions PepsiCo's Quaker deal FOOD &BEVERAGES 
DAFT POINTS TO PROBLEMS RIVAL MAY FACE WITH REGULATORS OVER $13.2bn ACQUISITION. 
Douglas Daft, chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, said in an interview with the Financial Times that 
PepsiCo's $13.2bn acquisition of Quaker Oats would face intense scrutiny from US regulators. 
"I think they'll have to do much more than just drop All-Sport," he said, referring to PepsiCo's sports drink brand. 
Only two weeks ago, Mr Daft had himself tried to secure a deal with Quaker after it rejected an initial offer from 
PepsiCo, but Coke's board opposed such a transaction at the last moment, fearful that the stock price would be 
hurt. 
Questions were also raised about whether Coke would have encountered regulatory problems. That offered 
PepsiCo a second chance to take Quaker, which owns the lucrative Gatorade sports drink business, and a deal 
was announced this week. 
PepsiCo has acknowledged that regulators will look closely at the deal but expressed confidence that it would be 
approved by the first half of next year. 
Roger Enrico, chairman and chief executive of PepsiCo, said: "I don't think it in any way, shape or form has a 
negative impact on competition." 
Mr Daft also questioned Pepsi's "legal strategy" in the beverage business, which has over the past few years 
involved filing complaints with regulators in several countries concerning Coke's market dominance. 
Suggesting PepsiCo's regulatory challenges against Coke could easily be redirected at PepsiCo's own market 
share of the world snack foods market, Mr Daft said: "It makes me wonder if they think in both parts of their 
business." 
Frito-Lay, which makes products such as Doritos Nacho and Lays potato chips, has a 48per cent share of the 
world market and almost 62 per cent in the US. 
PepsiCo's complaints, filed along with local bottlers and customers in countries such as Mexico and Germany 
over the past few years, led to a series of regulatory challenges against Coke over its landmark acquisitions of 
Cadbury Schweppes and Pernod Ricard's Orangina. 
Forced to scale back its Cadbury deal and retreat from buying Orangina, Coke has since shrunk its appetite for 
big acquisitions, concentrating instead on developing brands internally. 
Mr Daft said Coke nevertheless remained on the lookout for acquisitions to increase its worldwide sales and 
expand its brand portfolio. 
He did not rule out acquisitions in the next year, noting that Coke was adopting a flexible strategy aimed at one 
core promise: building up the Coca-Cola brand. Douglas Daft interview, www.ft.com/coke.

The on-off sale of US cereal giant Quaker Oats is back on again, with news that PepsiCo has agreed to purchase 
the Gatorade producer. Having originally had a bid turned down in November, it looked as if PepsiCo had lost out 
as its arch rival Coca-Cola Co stepped in and looked favourite to land Quaker. 
However talks broke down, only for French firm Danone to step in. Danone is looking for an entry into the US 
market, and acquiring Gatorade would have been ideal for Danone. However, no sooner had the French firm 
declared its interest, it dropped out. It now appears that PepsiCo has come back for a second bite of the cherry, 
with a deal not dissimilar to the original, believed to be worth around US$ 13.4bn (15.3bn [European dollar]). The 
difference with the new deal is that a `walk-away' clause is present in the deal. This will allow Quaker to walk 
away from the PepsiCo deal, should the cola giant's stock fall below US$92 per share. At the same time, PepsiCo 
has put a US$105 per share cap on its offer. The deal is expected to be confirmed at any time, but may remain 
subject to regulatory approval as PepsiCo already owns the smaller All-Sport energy drink. The brand may be 
sold off or even discontinued. It is not yet entirely clear what will happen to Quaker's food brands. Analysts 
believe that PepsiCo could sell the hot and cold cereal business over the next few years. Also likely to be sold off 
is the Rice-A-Roni brand of instant dishes. Quaker's energy bars will no doubt be integrated into the Frito-Lay 
unit. 
Elsewhere, in an interview with the Financial Times, PepsiCo chairman Roger Enrico said that PepsiCo was 
looking to buy salty snack producers in established European markets such as Germany and Scandinavia, as 
well as Japan. Enrico told the FT that acquiring companies was the preferred way for PepsiCo to grow. He also 
indicated that the company would like to move into sweet snack producing. PepsiCo has a highly successful 
snack unit, Frito-Lay, which is outperforming its better known drinks unit Pepsi-Cola, with the snack unit bringing 
in 65% of group profits.

Success of Quaker Deal Burnishes Standing of Rising Star at PepsiCo

Success of Quaker Deal Burnishes Standing of Rising Star at PepsiCo

At 6:15 a.m. Sunday, as PepsiCo Inc. prepared to announce its $13.8 billion (15.54 billion euros) acquisition of 
Quaker Oats Co., Indra Nooyi boarded a plane for Pittsburgh. The PepsiCo chief financial officer was going to 
offer thanks at a Hindu temple modeled on one in southern India that members of her family used to visit when 
something big was happening in their lives. 
There is no doubt something big is happening in Ms. Nooyi's life. Not only did she play a key role in PepsiCo's 
proposed acquisition of Quaker, but she will become the beverage and snack-food giant's No. 2 executive behind 
Chairman and CEO-designate Steven Reinemund when the deal closes next spring. As president and chief 
financial officer, Ms. Nooyi, 45 years old, will add oversight of legal affairs, human resources and corporate 
communications to responsibilities she already has for finance, strategic planning, and mergers and acquisitions. 
She will also be nominated for a seat on PepsiCo's board. 
The move elevates one of the highest-ranking Indian-born women in corporate America. Ms. Nooyi joins a 
handful of other executives from her homeland who have climbed high in corporate ranks here, including Rakesh 
Gangwal, the chief executive of US Airways Group Inc., the nation's sixth-largest airline, and Rono Dutta, 
president of UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, the largest domestic carrier. 
Known as a smart business and financial strategist, Ms. Nooyi was one of the key executives behind PepsiCo's 
transformation from a diffuse conglomerate that included restaurants and bottling plants to a corporation focused 
on convenience foods and beverages. She plays down her promotion, saying that she has gradually been taking 
on new responsibilities since becoming the chief financial officer in February. The company's operations, 
including such brand names as Pepsi, Tropicana and Frito-Lay, will report directly to Mr. Reinemund. 
Her move upward, together with that of Mr. Reinemund, who will become chairman and chief executive ahead of 
schedule, puts two executives in charge who share a vision for the company. They want to be on the cutting edge 
as people more and more demand foods and drinks that are consumed on the go. Acquiring Quaker -- with its 
Gatorade sports drinks and granola-bar and rice-cake snacks -- could help put them there. 
Ms. Nooyi easily merges her Hindu roots with the life of an American executive. Deeply religious, she has set 
aside an area of her Greenwich, Connecticut, home so that she can perfom puja, or prayer. When she was 
named chief financial officer in February, she told current PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Roger Enrico that she 
needed time to go to India to the temple where her family had always prayed. It took her a week after negotiations 
restarted between PepsiCo and Quaker to get to the Pittsburgh temple. She flew with her husband and daughter 
and made "a decent-sized offering," she said. 
Raised in a middle-class family in India, Ms. Nooyi came to the U.S. in 1978 to enroll in Yale University's 
Graduate School of Management. After Yale, she was hired by Boston Consulting Group, then held 
corporate-strategy jobs at technology giant Motorola Inc. and at Asea Brown Boveri before joining PepsiCo as a 
senior vice president of corporate strategy and development in 1994. 
PepsiCo was a far-less focused company back then, and troubled international operations were hurting its 
credibility on Wall Street. Working closely with Mr. Enrico, she and other executives spun off the company's 
restaurant and bottling businesses. Ms. Nooyi then spearheaded one of Pepsi's most successful acquisitions: 
Tropicana. A devotee of the company's orange juice who used to squeeze her own before she discovered 
Tropicana, Ms. Nooyi was among the first at PepsiCo to see the brand's potential, both for PepsiCo's earnings

Page 20 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
and to enhance the company's developing portfolio of convenience and "functional" foods and drinks. When other 
PepsiCo executives continued to question the $3.3 billion acquisition at a final meeting, "Roger and I just told 
them, `We are going to do it,'" she said. 
Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said, "With Tropicana, she was willing to 
take a lower-return-on-asset business because she saw a way to improve it to get strong margin growth. Her 
ability to find value in an acquisition is very high." 
Ms. Nooyi was the chief negotiator for PepsiCo on the Quaker deal. The negotiations with Quaker had their 
tense moments, as the two sides failed to reach an agreement last month, and Coca-Cola Co. made a stab at it 
before backing out at the last minute. Late last week, a major sticking point arose when Ms. Nooyi insisted on a 
cap on the stock price of no more than $105 a share for Quaker shareholders. Ms. Nooyi and Mr. Enrico won 
plaudits for sticking to the original terms of their deal. "Throughout the whole process, she was disciplined and 
held very firm," said Steven Baronoff, co-head of mergers at Merrill Lynch, which represented PepsiCo. 
Concerned about how Wall Street would perceive a deal, she set growth targets for the new combined company 
that were more conservative than those analysts were estimating. "We have a financial discipline we're all very 
proud of," she said. 
Ms. Nooyi said she will spend the next several months working with Mr. Reinemund to integrate Quaker and 
define new areas for growth. They will be joined by Mr. Enrico and Robert Morrison, who will step down from their 
respective jobs as chairmen of PepsiCo and Quaker to help lead the effort as PepsiCo vice-chairmen.. 
Shares of both companies rose on the official announcement of their deal. PepsiCo shares were up $1.44 at 
$43.81 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Shares of Quaker jumped $2.44 to $91.06 on 
the Big Board. According to the plan, Quaker shareholders would receive 2.3 shares of Pepsi, which based on 
Pepsi's closing price would be valued at $100.76 a share. 
PepsiCo also said its board had rescinded its recently authorized plan to buy back $4 billion of stock over the next 
three years, as well as the remaining $200 million under a previous $3 billion buyback program.

proposed acquisition of Quaker, but she will become the beverage and snack-food giant's No. 2 executive behind 
Chairman and CEO-designate Steven Reinemund when the deal closes next spring. As president and chief 
financial officer, Ms. Nooyi, 45 years old, will add oversight of legal affairs, human resources and corporate 
communications to responsibilities she already has for finance, strategic planning, and mergers and acquisitions. 
She will also be nominated for a seat on PepsiCo's board. 
The move elevates one of the highest-ranking Indian-born women in corporate America. Ms. Nooyi joins a 
handful of other executives from her homeland who have climbed high in corporate ranks here, including Rakesh 
Gangwal, the chief executive of US Airways Group Inc., the nation's sixth-largest airline, and Rono Dutta, 
president of UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, the largest domestic carrier. 
Known as a smart business and financial strategist, Ms. Nooyi was one of the key executives behind PepsiCo's 
transformation from a diffuse conglomerate that included restaurants and bottling plants to a corporation focused 
on convenience foods and beverages. She plays down her promotion, saying that she has gradually been taking 
on new responsibilities since becoming the chief financial officer in February. The company's operations, 
including such brand names as Pepsi, Tropicana and Frito-Lay, will report directly to Mr. Reinemund. 
Her move upward, together with that of Mr. Reinemund, who will become chairman and chief executive ahead of 
schedule, puts two executives in charge who share a vision for the company. They want to be on the cutting edge 
as people more and more demand foods and drinks that are consumed on the go. Acquiring Quaker -- with its 
Gatorade sports drinks and granola-bar and rice-cake snacks -- could help put them there. 
Ms. Nooyi easily merges her Hindu roots with the life of an American executive. Deeply religious, she has set 
aside an area of her Greenwich, Connecticut, home so that she can perform puja, or prayer. When she was 
named chief financial officer in February, she told current PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Roger Enrico that she 
needed time to go to India to the temple where her family had always prayed. It took her a week after negotiations 
restarted between PepsiCo and Quaker to get to the Pittsburgh temple. She flew with her husband and daughter 
and made "a decent-sized offering," she said. 
Raised in a middle-class family in India, Ms. Nooyi came to the U.S. in 1978 to enroll in Yale University's 
Graduate School of Management. After Yale, she was hired by Boston Consulting Group, then held 
corporate-strategy jobs at technology giant Motorola Inc. and at Asea Brown Boveri before joining PepsiCo as a 
senior vice president of corporate strategy and development in 1994. 
PepsiCo was a far-less focused company back then, and troubled international operations were hurting its 
credibility on Wall Street. Working closely with Mr. Enrico, she and other executives spun off the company's 
restaurant and bottling businesses. Ms. Nooyi then spearheaded one of Pepsi's most successful acquisitions: 
Tropicana. A devotee of the company's orange juice who used to squeeze her own before she discovered 
Tropicana, Ms. Nooyi was among the first at PepsiCo to see the brand's potential, both for PepsiCo's earnings

and to enhance the company's developing portfolio of convenience and "functional" foods and drinks. When other 
PepsiCo executives continued to question the $3.3 billion acquisition at a final meeting, "Roger and I just told 
them, `We are going to do it,' " she said. 
Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said, "With Tropicana, she was willing to 
take a lower-return-on-asset business because she saw a way to improve it to get strong margin growth. Her 
ability to find value in an acquisition is very high." 
Ms. Nooyi was the chief negotiator for PepsiCo on the Quaker deal. The negotiations with Quaker had their 
tense moments, as the two sides failed to reach an agreement last month, and Coca-Cola Co. made a stab at it 
before backing out at the last minute. Late last week, a major sticking point arose when Ms. Nooyi insisted on a 
cap on the stock price of no more than $105 a share for Quaker shareholders. Ms. Nooyi and Mr. Enrico won 
plaudits for sticking to the original terms of their deal. "Throughout the whole process, she was disciplined and 
held very firm," said Steven Baronoff, co-head of mergers at Merrill Lynch, which represented PepsiCo. 
Concerned about how Wall Street would perceive a deal, she set growth targets for the new combined company 
that were more conservative than those analysts were estimating. "We have a financial discipline we're all very 
proud of," she said. 
Ms. Nooyi said she will spend the next several months working with Mr. Reinemund to integrate Quaker and 
define new areas for growth. They will be joined by Mr. Enrico and Robert Morrison, who will step down from their 
respective jobs as chairmen of PepsiCo and Quaker to help lead the effort as PepsiCo vice-chairmen.. 
Shares of both companies rose on the official announcement of their deal. PepsiCo shares were up $1.44 at 
$43.81 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Shares of Quaker jumped $2.44 to $91.06 on 
the Big Board. According to the plan, Quaker shareholders would receive 2.3 shares of Pepsi, which based on 
Pepsi's closing price would be valued at $100.76 a share.

At 6:15 a.m. Sunday, as PepsiCo Inc. prepared to announce its $13.8 billion acquisition of Quaker Oats Co.,

Telefonica and Lucent Sign 
Deal Valued at $800 Million 
Telefonica Moviles, the mobile-services arm of Spain's Telefonica SA, has signed a six year, $800 million deal 
with Lucent Technologies to acquire equipment and services for its future third-generation mobile voice and data 
network in Germany. 
The deal marks a significant win for Lucent. The American networking giant is embroiled in an intense competition 
to provide equipment for 3G, the technology expected to overtake today's limited mobile data services by 
providing high-speed mobile Internet capabilities. 
The agreement is "our first major European win for 3G," said Scott Erickson, senior vice president for wireless 
marketing at Lucent. "The Germany market is one of the fastest-growing markets, and this provides the 
framework for us to provide 3G equipment in Austria, Italy, and Spain." 
Revenue from the possible multinational contract with Telefonica could run into the multibillions, a potentially 
significant portion of Lucent's total future revenue, Mr. Erickson said. Lucent had revenue of slightly more than 
$30 billion during the past fiscal year. 
Being a major supplier for "a credible player in the European market starts to position Lucent as a major supplier" 
Mr. Erickson said. (Staff)

Quaker Pepsi's choice for the regeneration.

WHEN PepsiCo buys food giant Quaker Oats for $US13 billion ($24 billion), it will pick up not only Quaker's 
prized sports drink Gatorade, but more supermarket shelf space and a sportier image. 
The acquisition of Gatorade will top off PepsiCo's extensive beverage line. The company recently acquired SoBe, 
a herb-laced line of drinks, and has Aquafina bottled water, a range of juices and juice drinks and, of course, 
Pepsi colas. In addition, PepsiCo's Frito-Lay is the largest snack food company in the world. 
Under the purchase agreement, which must be approved by regulators, PepsiCo would exchange 2.3 shares of 
its stock for each share of Quaker, up to a maximum value of $US105 for each Quaker share. 
The combined company, which will retain the PepsiCo name, will have revenues of about $US25 billion with an 
expected market capitalisation of more than $US80 billion, placing it among the world's five largest consumer 
products companies. 
PepsiCo chairman and chief executive Roger Enrico said his company and Quaker were an outstanding 
combination. 
"Bringing together Quaker and PepsiCo creates a wealth of exciting growth opportunities as well as important 
cost and selling synergies," he says. 
Analysts approved of the deal. "It's a plus-plus, win-win situation," says Peter Harleman, vice-chairman of Landor 
Associates, a branding consultancy firm. 
"They have a tremendous arsenal of brands now. It makes them the leader in high-energy, on-the-go foods. This 
is the energy for the e-world." 
The purchase allows Pepsi to develop more products that carry the powerful Gatorade logo and use its massive 
distribution network to take Gatorade globally to places where it hasn't been before, branding pundits say. 
Gatorade controls more than 83.5 per cent of the sports drink market, according to Beverage Digest, an industry 
newsletter. 
"When you have a dominant brand like that, it's an enormous weapon," says Jack Trout, president of Trout & 
Partners, a marketing strategy firm. 
However, at present Gatorade has only a modest presence internationally, drawing about 80 per cent of its sales 
and 97 per cent of its operating income from the US. 
"Pepsi has enormous clout with the retailers and selling Gatorade through those channels means you'll see 
Gatorade in more places now," says Chuck Brymer, chief executive of brand consulting firm Interbrand, a division 
of advertising company Omnicom. 
In fact, Gatorade could now turn up in restaurants, gymnasiums, health clubs and schools, says Ira Matathia, 
chief executive of The Intelligence Factory, a marketing communications company within Young & Rubicam. 
The deal not only puts the Gatorade brand in Pepsi's basket of products, it also adds Quaker Oats' food products 
such as energy bars and cereal mixes. That further extends PepsiCo's reach in the supermarket aisle.

Page 28 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Harleman says PepsiCo is particularly skilful at exploiting opportunities at cross-branding, or using the allure of 
one brand to generate sales for another. 
It has long worked with retailers to ensure its products are displayed so that the consumer who grabs Frito-Lay 
snacks in a supermarket aisle can pick up Pepsi drinks in the same aisle to wash them down. 
There are other upshots for Pepsi as well. It could mean creating a more youthful image for Pepsi by associating 
itself with a sporty, energetic drink such as Gatorade that attracts athletes and college students.

Windfall of $112m for Quaker Oats chief. 
Windfall of $112m for Quaker Oats chief.

ROBERT MORRISON, the chairman of Quaker Oats, is to receive a windfall of up to $112 million ( #77 million) 
after his company finally succumbed to a $13.4 billion takeover bid by PepsiCo yesterday (see Commentary, this 
page). 
His 1.15 million Quaker shares, including stock that he was eligible to pick up from exercising share options in the 
spring of 2000, were worth up to $111.6 million, according to the closing price of PepsiCo shares on Friday. 
Mr Morrison will remain chief executive of Quaker under PepsiCo's ownership, and will take on the role of 
PepsiCo vice-chairman. 
To win over the Quaker board - and get control of Quaker's fast-growing sports drink, Gatorade - PepsiCo was 
forced to include a clause that allows Quaker to pull out of the deal without any penalty if PepsiCo's shares fall 
below $40. They rose 3.4 per cent yesterday to close at $43.81. 
Quaker had already rejected one overture from PepsiCo in the hope of attracting a better offer but the withdrawal 
of Coca-Cola and Danone from negotiations revived the original talks. The "escape clause" reflects market 
volatility. 
PepsiCo also said that Roger Enrico, its current chairman and chief executive, will step down from these 
positions when the deal is completed in the first half of 2001 to take up the role of vice-chairman. Steve 
Reinemund, who had already been designated as Mr Enrico's successor, will then take on the top two titles. 
Indra Nooyi, the PepsiCo chief financial officer, is to take a more prominent role after the deal. She has added the 
title of president and a seat on the board to her current post. 
Ms Nooyi is one of the most powerful women in US industry. She went to business school in Calcutta and began 
her career as a product manager for Johnson & Johnson in India. 
Analysts believe that her promotion leaves her well-placed to succeed Mr Reinemund as chief executive. 
The change at the top of the company comes earlier than PepsiCo suggested in October. Then, Mr Enrico said 
he planned to step down from the chief executive role "before the end of 2001" and retire as chairman "before the 
end of 2002".

There is no question that PepsiCo Inc. wanted Quaker Oats Co. for its powerhouse Gatorade sports drink. But 
Pepsi also is looking forward to munching on Quaker's snack foods. 
Quaker's food business, which makes up about 60% of its revenue, is highly profitable, and some of its products 
can enhance Pepsi's goal of becoming the leading seller of convenience foods and beverages, PepsiCo 
executives say. 
With its $13.4 billion (15.26 billion euros) purchase of Quaker, the Purchase, New York, snack-food and 
beverage titan sees a bright future in Quaker's small but growing business in chewy granola and other bars, as 
well as its rice cakes. PepsiCo already has been working on expanding its Frito-Lay division, which made up 62% 
of the company's sales last year, beyond the salty and other snack markets it dominates into "on the go" light 
meals and nutritious snacks. 
Owning Quaker's bar business will give the company an instant entry into the morning "daypart," where Pepsi 
sees a lot of opportunity as consumers increasingly skip breakfast and eat on the go, PepsiCo Chairman Roger 
Enrico said in an interview. "As important as the Gatorade brand is, we believe the Quaker brand provides future 
scale for us," Mr. Enrico said. "The on-the-go minimeal concept is manifesting itself in bars. . . . Minimeals are 
more and more the way people are taking in nutrition." 
"You have to have a 10-year-old kid to know how hot those chewy granola bars are right now," said John 
McMillin, a Prudential Securities analyst. 
Mr. Enrico said PepsiCo would look for opportunities for innovation with bars, but it added that just putting such 
snacks into Frito-Lay's massive distribution system, which recently has been re-engineered to allow for even 
greater capacity, would significantly increase sales. Quaker's snacks make up about 3% of the company's 
revenue. "We can use Frito-Lay's capability to add significantly to the business Quaker already has," Mr. Enrico 
said. 
PepsiCo's plans for Chicago-based Quaker's other food businesses, which include slow-growth products such as 
cold cereal as well as such highly profitable businesses as oatmeal, are more modest. Mr. Enrico said PepsiCo 
has no plans either to sell such businesses after two years or spin them off. He said PepsiCo had factored 
conservative profit growth of about 4.5% for such foods. 
"These businesses clearly do not fit with our convenient-beverage- and-food strategy," he said. Nevertheless, he 
said, "We will run them on an even keel as they have done. Given our plan and expectations, we feel that this is a 
manageable part" of the portfolio. 
PepsiCo can capitalize on some of the better-known brand names, said Steven Reinemund, PepsiCo's president 
and chief operating officer. Mr. Reinemund also said Frito-Lay would be able to pick up new expertise from 
Quaker on making grain-based snacks. 
Cold cereal is Quaker's biggest business after Gatorade, with more than $700 million in revenue. But the 
cold-cereal business has been weak in recent years, as more consumers eat on the run.

Page 31 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
But oatmeal, which makes up about 10% of Quaker's revenue, according to analysts, has become one of 
Quaker's best moneymakers. The company has done a good job promoting oatmeal as a cholesterol fighter, and 
it has introduced flavors such as French vanilla that have become popular with adults. The company's kid-friendly 
oatmeal -- with egg-shaped sugar puffs that turn into tiny dinosaurs when mixed with hot water -- also has been a 
surprise hit. At the same time, Quaker enjoys huge profit margins and a dominant market share. 
Other products such as Rice-A-Roni and Aunt Jemima syrup dominate their markets but have shown little growth. 
Still, even if Quaker's portfolio includes a lot of less-than-sexy categories, analysts say the company has one of 
the better management teams in the industry. PepsiCo said Quaker management will be kept in place. 
Mr. Enrico said Quaker's nonsnack foods will make up 10% of PepsiCo's sales and 11% of its operating profit. 
Pepsi's biggest focus, of course, will be on Gatorade. Noncarbonated beverages are growing three times as fast 
as carbonated beverages, and much of that growth comes from young consumers. Increasingly, children are 
learning to drink Gatorade at an early age -- at soccer practices, for example -- and they are learning to associate 
it with healthy behavior. 
Mr. Enrico said owning Gatorade would enhance PepsiCo's clout in the supermarket aisle containing "shelf 
stable" juices. He said because Gatorade and shelf-stable juices produced by 
PepsiCo's Tropicana unit are distributed similarly, the units' sales forces would work together. 
"This gives us a fourth aisle of the supermarket, with enough scale to be the preferred partner to the retailer," he 
said. 
While Gatorade is distributed through a warehouse system to supermarkets, Pepsi will be able to boost volume 
by increasing the drink's presence in smaller, neighborhood stores and in vending machines through its own 
bottler network. William Pecoriello, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said in a research note that Pepsi 
can boost Gatorade's volume by 10% by putting it into Pepsi's bottler network. 
Several analysts said the acquisition of Quaker, and with it, Gatorade, represents an opportunity for Pepsi's 
largest bottler, Pepsi Bottling Group Inc., because of the volume lift it will gain "without having to pay anything for 
this upside," UBS Warburg analyst Caroline Levy wrote. 
Pepsi's opportunities to expand Quaker's business overseas are more limited than those Coca-Cola Co. would 
have had if it had acquired Quaker. But Mr. 
Enrico said he sees opportunities for Gatorade and Quaker foods to be sold in international markets. Quaker 
recently began selling Gatorade in Latin America, but there are many more warm-weather climates that remain 
untouched. The brand is sold in 53 international markets, but its presence isn't strong.

PepsiCo gets its Oats in 9.4 billion pound deal. 
PepsiCo gets its Oats in 9.4 billion pound deal.

PEPSICO finally got its man yesterday as it announced the acquisition of Quaker Oats in a deal worth #9.4 
billion. 
The all-shares deal was hammered out over the weekend behind closed doors and ends just over a month of 
speculation over who would eventually buy Quaker and win the prize of its top selling sports drink, Gatorade. 
Last month, PepsiCo pulled out of talks with Quaker and watched on the sidelines as arch rival Coca-Cola moved 
in. But Coca-Cola abruptly pulled out of a deal amid speculation that Quaker was asking too much. French food 
group Danone then announced its desire to acquire Chicago-based Quaker, but it too abruptly withdrew a day 
later. Nestle was rumoured to be interested before PepsiCo returned to the table. 
The deal involves investors in Quaker swapping each of their shares for 2.3 PepsiCo shares, in an agreement 
that matches the bid Quaker is understood to have rejected from PepsiCo when earlier talks broke down. 
Based on Friday's closing price, PepsiCo's offer is valued at $97.46 per Quaker share, representing a 10 per cent 
premium over Quaker's closing price of 88-5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday. 
If the value to Quaker shareholders falls below $92 per share, Quaker can abandon the deal without penalty, the 
companies said. Also, PepsiCo's offer is capped at $105 per Quaker share. 
The acquisition gives PepsiCo, the number two soft drinks company behind Atlanta giant Coca-Cola, around 
one-third of the US non-carbonated drinks market. Gatorade holds over 80 per cent of the US sports drink 
market. 
In a statement, PepsiCo chairman and chief executive Roger Enrico said: "This will be an outstanding 
combination. Bringing together Quaker and PepsiCo creates a wealth of exciting growth opportunities as well as 
important cost and selling synergies. 
Quaker chairman Robert Morrison added: "Combining with the PepsiCo organisation will unleash the tremendous 
global growth potential of the Gatorade brand." 
Upon deal completion, Enrico and Morrison will become vice chairmen of PepsiCo. PepsiCo president Steve 
Reinemund will then take over the reins of the company two years ahead of schedule.

communications to responsibilities she already has for finance, strategic planning, and mergers and acquisitions. 
She will also be nominated for a seat on PepsiCo's board. 
The move elevates one of the highest-ranking Indian-born women in corporate America. Ms. Nooyi joins a 
handful of other executives from her homeland who have climbed high in corporate ranks, including Rakesh 
Gangwal, the chief executive of US Airways Group Inc., the nation's sixth-largest airline, and Rono Dutta, 
president of UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, the largest domestic carrier. 
Known as a smart business and financial strategist, Ms. Nooyi was one of the key executives behind PepsiCo's 
transformation from a diffuse conglomerate that included restaurants and bottling plants to a corporation focused 
on convenience foods and beverages. She plays down her promotion, saying that she has gradually been taking 
on new responsibilities since becoming CFO in February. The company's operations, including such brand names 
as Pepsi, Tropicana and Frito-Lay, will report directly to Mr. Reinemund. 
But her move upward, together with that of Mr. Reinemund, who will become chairman and chief executive ahead 
of schedule, puts two executives in charge who share a vision for the company. They want to be on the cutting 
edge as consumers demand foods and drinks that are consumed on the go. Acquiring Quaker -- with its 
Gatorade sports drinks and granola-bar and rice-cake snacks -- could help put them there. 
Mr. Reinemund is one of Ms. Nooyi's biggest fans. "She's been instrumental in everything we have done over the 
last five years," he says. "Not only is she good at everything she does, but she's a lot of fun." 
Though a self-professed workaholic, Ms. Nooyi likes to keep the mood light. She is known to sing around the 
executive office and keeps a karaoke machine at home. She once kept a "yes" man statuette on her desk at 
work; when touched, it made ingratiating utterances. 
In speeches, she uses humor to get her points across. Describing the hurried lifestyle that puts PepsiCo's 
products in demand, she once told an audience of investors and analysts that she hadn't realized how precious 
time was until a driver passed her on the highway flossing his teeth. 
Ms. Nooyi easily merges her Hindu roots with the life of an American executive. Deeply religious, she has set 
aside an area of her Greenwich, Conn., home so that she can perfom puja, or prayer. When she was named chief 
financial officer in February, she told current PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Roger Enrico that she needed time to 
go to India to the temple where her family had always prayed. It took her a week after negotiations restarted 
between PepsiCo and Quaker to get to the Pittsburgh temple. She flew with her husband and daughter and made 
"a decent-sized offering," she says. 
Raised in a middle-class family in India, Ms. Nooyi came to the U.S. in 1978 to enroll in Yale University's 
Graduate School of Management. After Yale, she was hired by Boston Consulting Group, then held

Page 34 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
corporate-strategy jobs at technology giant Motorola Inc. and at Asea Brown Boveri before joining PepsiCo as a 
senior vice president of corporate strategy and development in 1994. 
PepsiCo was a far less focused company back then, and troubled international operations were hurting its 
credibility on Wall Street. Working closely with Mr. Enrico, she and other executives spun off the company's 
restaurant and bottling businesses. Ms. Nooyi then spearheaded one of Pepsi's most successful acquisitions: 
Tropicana. A devotee of the company's orange juice who used to squeeze her own before she discovered 
Tropicana, Ms. Nooyi was among the first at PepsiCo to see the brand's potential, both for PepsiCo's earnings 
and to enhance the company's developing portfolio of convenience and "functional" foods and drinks. When other 
PepsiCo executives continued to question the $3.3 billion acquisition at a final meeting, "Roger and I just told 
them, `We are going to do it,'" she says. 
"Indra is extraordinarily financially detailed," says Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter. "With Tropicana, she was willing to take a lower-return-on-asset business because she saw a way to 
improve it to get strong margin growth. Her ability to find value in an acquisition is very high." 
Ms. Nooyi was the chief negotiator for PepsiCo on the Quaker deal. The negotiations with Quaker had their 
tense moments, as the two sides failed to reach an agreement last month and Coca-Cola Co. swooped in before 
backing out at the last minute. Late last week, a major sticking point arose when Ms. Nooyi insisted on a cap on 
the stock price of no more than $105 a share for Quaker shareholders. Ms. Nooyi and Mr. Enrico won plaudits for 
sticking to the original terms of their deal. "Throughout the whole process, she was disciplined and held very firm," 
says Steven Baronoff, co-head of mergers at Merrill Lynch, which represented PepsiCo. 
Concerned about how Wall Street would perceive a deal, she set growth targets for the new combined company 
that were more conservative than those analysts were estimating. "We have a financial discipline we're all very 
proud of," she says. 
Known for her humor, Ms. Nooyi also speaks her mind. Pepsi executives were forced to scrap an early version of 
the packaging for the company's new Sierra Mist lemon-lime soda when she said it reminded her of detergent, 
according to an executive. 
Ms. Nooyi agrees she can be tough. "I think I've got a human touch, but ultimately my interest is PepsiCo," she 
says. 
Ms. Nooyi says she will spend the next several months working with Mr. Reinemund to integrate Quaker and 
define new areas for growth. They will be joined by Mr. Enrico and Robert Morrison, who will step down from their 
respective jobs as chairmen of PepsiCo and Quaker to help lead the effort as PepsiCo vice-chairmen. "If we 
integrate Quaker seamlessly, this is going to be a bigger home run than Tropicana," Ms. Nooyi says of the 
Quaker acquisition. 
Shares of both companies rose on the official announcement of their deal. PepsiCo shares gained $1.44 to 
$43.81 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Shares of Quaker jumped $2.44 to $91.06 on the 
Big Board. According to the plan, Quaker shareholders would receive 2.3 shares of Pepsi, which based on 
Pepsi's closing price would be valued at $100.76 a share. 
PepsiCo also said yesterday that its board had rescinded its recently authorized plan to buy back $4 billion of 
stock over the next three years, as well as the remaining $200 million under a previous $3 billion buyback 
program.

PEPSICO and Quaker Oats yesterday agreed a $13.4bn (#9.2bn) all-share merger after hammering out some 
last-minute differences over the weekend. 
Wall Street applauded the deal by marking up shares in both companies in morning trading. Quaker secured an 
11th-hour escape clause to protect it should PepsiCo shares tumble on news of the deal. 
Robert Morrison, Quaker's chief executive officer, fought and won a stipulation that should PepsiCo stock fall to 
less than $40 for 10 random days during the month prior to closing the deal, which is thought to happen sometime 
in the spring, he can walk away. 
Also in the small print, the fizzy drinks giant's chairman and CEO, Roger Enrico, was granted price protection for 
his bid, capping it at $105 a Quaker share and a lump sum if the oats company tries again to sell to Pepsi's arch 
rival Coke. And if PepsiCo stock rises to more than $45.65 a share, Quaker shareholders would get just $105 a 
share, up from the $97 stock-swap asking price. 
If Quaker terminates the deal, PepsiCo would receive a $420m break-up fee. 
Quaker becomes the latest Chicago company swept up in a wave of consolidation in the food industry. In 
October, Keebler Foods was bought by Kellogg for $3.9bn in cash. Earlier this year, Philip Morris, the parent of 
Kraft Foods, acquired Nabisco for $14.9bn in cash. 
The agreement caps a stellar three-year run for Robert Morrison, Quaker's chairman, president and chief 
executive officer. 
The former CEO of Kraft Foods, Mr Morrison took over a company that, despite the success of Gatorade, was in 
disarray after the bungled acquisition of the New Age drink Snapple. Quaker sold Snapple in 1997 at the fire-sale 
price of $300m - $1.4bn less than it paid for the company in 1994. 
Combining PepsiCo and Quaker will create a company with a strong position in the growing market for 
convenient foods and beverages. The combined company, which will retain the PepsiCo name, will have 
revenues of $25bn. Its expected market capitalisation of more than $80bn will place it among the world's five 
largest consumer products companies. 
"This will be a truly outstanding combination," said Mr Enrico. 
PepsiCo's closing price on Friday was $42.38, with Quaker at $88.63.

A drink created for thirsty college football players in Florida was at the centre of a $13.4bn ( #9.2bn) deal 
yesterday when PepsiCo agreed to buy Quaker Oats, owner of the Gatorade sports drink. 
Shares in Pepsi and Quaker rose as investors welcomed the conclusion of a takeover battle which started more 
than a month ago. 
The acquisition will put Pepsi ahead of rival Coca-Cola in the fast growing market for `non-carbonated' drinks. 
Gatorade, which was developed in 1965 to stop the University of Florida Gators from dehydrating, is America's 
top-selling sports drink with 83% of the market. 
Roger Enrico, chairman and chief executive of Pepsi, said non-carbonated drinks were expected to grow three 
times as fast as carbonated ones in the next few years. The company is likely to use its distribution network to 
increase overseas sales. 
Gatorade, available in varying flavours according to country of sale, contributes about 40% of Quaker's sales and 
profits. Sales increased 15% last year. Pepsi sales rose 4%. 
Mr Enrico, who will step down as chairman once the deal is completed next year, also expected Quaker's snack 
food business to grow rapidly. `More and more people are getting their nutritional and calorific intake through 
on-the-go meals,' he said. Quaker owns a range of cereal and fruit bars as well as the eponymous porridge oats. 
Under the terms of the all-share deal, Pepsi will offer 2.3 of its own shares to Quaker shareholders. Based on 
Friday's closing price of $42.38, this values the Chicago-based food business at $97.50 a share, an 18% premium 
to its price in early November when reports of takeover talks first emerged. 
Shares in Quaker rose $2.50 to $91.06 yesterday morning. At midday, shares in Pepsi were also up almost $2, 
valuing each Quaker share at $101.6 and the deal at $13.8bn before the assumption of $750m in debt. 
Yesterday's agreement included a provi sion for Quaker to walk away from the deal if its value falls below $92 a 
share. 
John Macmillan, food analyst at Prudential Securities, said the deal was good for both sides. `If colas are not 
growing, you have got to expand your hand,' he said. 
Shareholders in Quaker Oats were disappointed two weeks ago when Coca-Cola withdrew from a proposed 
$15bn bid. 
Quaker Oats, which dates back more than 100 years, has been revitalised by the popu larity of Gatorade, which it 
bought in 1983. The former miller adopted the Quaker Man as a logo in 1901, much to the annoyance of the 
Society of Friends (the Quakers) with which it has no connection. 
Pepsi said that it expected re structuring costs of $400m from a deal which would be earnings enhancing within 
12 months of completion. It also expected $65m savings on costs within five years but declined to say where 
these would fall.

Those of little faith were right about CrossKeys,which until yesterday enjoyed something of an evangelical 
following. Despite a litany of warnings, the odd miracle kept investors believing to the end. The signs were 
everywhere. Seven quarters ago, CrossKeys blamed the bankruptcy of a customer and weakness in Asia for a 
profit and revenue shortfall. Six quarters ago, the loss of a contract was the culprit. Five quarters ago, the 
company couldn't clear a lowered profit bar. Even in the latest quarter, the problem, as with the latest warning, 
was delayed contracts. "If we were losing this business," CEO Ian McLaren said at the time, "it would be a great 
concern. We're not losing it." Mr. McLaren, who faced a Herculean task when he took the helm, may be right, but 
that's hardly relevant at this point. With $4-million in cash, the company, which will lose between $12-million and 
$14-million this quarter, is out of time. 
Anyone still hunkered down in the compound should break out with whatever they can salvage. 
Trouble brewing in Telecom City? 
CrossKeys' grim tidings throw a little more fuel on a fire no one wants flaring up again. The company says its 
problems are due to a slowdown in spending in the telecom industry. Nortel, Cisco, JDS and other shareholders 
remember that bugaboo. It was first suggested early in the fall and helped lop a fat slice off the market values of 
fibre optic and networking shares. Some investors assuaged their chagrin with the argument that only upstarts 
were in trouble, not traditional carriers. But CrossKeys says its big-league customers are slowing spending, too. 
Back door looks like good way into PepsiCo 
Investors don't seem to like the idea of washing down their oats with cola. At current prices, PepsiCo's offer for 
Quaker Oats is worth $101 (U.S.) a share, but Quaker is trading at $91. A trading gap is expected in a paper 
deal but this one's a little wide, especially given how well this deal was crafted for shareholders. Before the bid, 
PepsiCo was expected to earn $1.63 a share. PepsiCo CEO Roger Enrico says the merger will add between 1 
cent and 2 cents a share. He's a cautious man, however, and that estimate is typically conservative. It assumes a 
much-lower-than-expected growth rate for Gatorade and deliberately plays down the benefits PepsiCo will reap 
from adding Quaker's increasingly popular snack foods to its own on supermarket shelves. There is one area of 
mild concern: Quaker's non-snack food business, which grew only 1 per cent last year, can't be spun off for two 
years under the terms of the merger. But buying PepsiCo through Quaker means getting a defensive company 
with good growth prospects for 27 times earnings -- in a bear market.

Pepsi seals Quaker deal $13.4-billion buyout of Gatorade maker strengthens shares of both companies

NEW YORK -- PepsiCo Inc. shares rose yesterday after it sealed a deal to buy Quaker Oats Co. for about 
$13.4-billion (U.S.) in stock. 
Adding the popular Gatorade to its fleet of non-carbonated beverages, which includes Aquafina water, Lipton teas 
and Tropicana juices, will give PepsiCo the dominant brand in the $2.5-billion sports drink category. 
"This is one terrific moment in the history of PepsiCo and Quaker," Roger Enrico, PepsiCo chairman and chief 
executive officer, told investors and analysts in a conference call. 
He said the deal will help PepsiCo grow faster than expected in both revenue and profits. 
PepsiCo shares, which had slid 6.6 per cent on Friday amid reports it was close to a deal, rose 3.4 per cent 
yesterday, or $1.43 a share, to $43.81 on the New York Stock Exchange. Quaker shares also were higher, rising 
$2.37, or 2.7 per cent, to $91 a share. 
At least two PepsiCo rivals had a similar thirst to acquire Quaker. Coca-Cola Co. abandoned its pursuit of 
Quaker Oats after the soft drink company's board rejected a deal reportedly worth $15.75-billion. Only hours after 
Coca-Cola's announcement, the French food conglomerate Danone SA issued a statement that it may be 
interested in making a bid for Quaker Oats. But it also quickly dropped out of the running. 
In the end, PepsiCo beat out its competitors with an offer that essentially mirrored the one rejected by 
Chicago-based Quaker roughly one month ago. 
"Gatorade would do even better under PepsiCo than it has under Quaker Oats because of better marketing and 
distribution," said John Sicher, a veteran soft drink industry watcher who publishes Beverage Digest in New York. 
PepsiCo will offer 2.3 of its shares for each Quaker share under the agreement announced yesterday. The 
boards of both companies approved the deal over the weekend, but it's still subject to regulatory approval. 
The deal could raise antitrust concerns because of PepsiCo's ownership of All-Sport, a competing brand to 
Gatorade, albeit with much less market share. However, PepsiCo has agreed to get rid of All-Sport to keep the 
deal alive. 
Gatorade began in the 1960s as a drink for thirsty athletes but has become a mainstream beverage. 
Beverage Digest estimated Gatorade accounted for 84.1 per cent of take-home sales of sports drinks in the first 
nine months of this year. Coke's Powerade had 10.9 per cent while PepsiCo's All Sport had 2.8 per cent, 
Beverage Digest said. 
Tom Pirko, who heads the beverage consulting firm Bevmark in Santa Barbara, Calif., said a PepsiCo-owned 
Gatorade would actually be good for competition. Under PepsiCo, Gatorade would benefit from a vast distribution 
system and over time would spur demand for more products in the sports drink category, he said.

Page 39 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Mr. Pirko said the acquisition of Quaker Oats, and Gatorade in particular, would give PepsiCo a "huge 
psychological edge" in its competition with Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, the world's leading soft drink manufacturer. 
"PepsiCo is building a formidable "package of leading brands," he said. 
While picking up Gatorade was no doubt the primary thrust of this transaction for PepsiCo, analysts were quick to 
point out that Quaker Oats' food products, which include granola snack bars and rice cakes, nicely complement 
PepsiCo's line of salty snacks. 
"Quaker Oats' grain-based snacks could show real growth within the Frito-Lay marketing and distribution 
system," Mr. Sicher said. "PepsiCo's Frito-Lay division is the nation's leader in salty snacks with brands such as 
Lay's, Fritos and Doritos chips. 
Quaker vast food business also includes such brands as Cap'n Crunch, Aunt Jemima and Rice-A-Roni. 
When the deal closes, Mr. Enrico said Steve Reinemund, PepsiCo president and chief operating officer, will 
succeed him as chairman and CEO. Chief financial officer Indra Nooyi will add the title of president. 
Robert Morrison, Quaker chairman and CEO, will be a vice-chairman of the combined company. 
Under terms of the deal, Quaker Oats can back out if PepsiCo's stock dips below $40 a share for a period of 10 
random days in the month before closing. Under this scenario, PepsiCo would have to increase the share 
exchange ratio in order to keep the deal alive.

Beware 
As Bob Morrison, chief executive of Quaker Oats, shook hands with PepsiCo's Roger Enrico for the cameras 
yesterday, he must have thought back to the moment almost two weeks ago when he adopted a strikingly similar 
pose with Enrico's arch-rival, Doug Daft of Coca-Cola. 
On that fateful night at the St Regis hotel in New York, Morrison was so sure that he had sewn up a takeover of 
Quaker by Coke that the two men had publicity photos taken before Coke officials started their board meeting. 
Unfortunately for both men, the meeting turned out to be more than the usual formality, as other Coke directors, 
led by Warren Buffett, unceremoniously voted down what would have been the Atlanta titan's largest deal. 
This might have left Daft vulnerable but the spin from Atlanta has been that this is no setback at all for the affable 
Australian, who cut his teeth in the consensus-centric business culture of Asia. Few people elsewhere in the 
drinks business or on Wall Street see the outcome positively, so the jokes have been predictably unkind. 
After the boards of PepsiCo and Quaker met to approve their deal this weekend, one person close to Quaker 
noted: "We got it right this time; we let their board go first." 
As clever souls in the Quaker camp have taken to saying: "You don't want to get Dafted."

COMPANIES &FINANCE THE AMERICAS - PepsiCo spells out boost from Quaker buy FOOD AND DRINK 
ACQUISITION SEEN AS INCREASING EARNINGS AND REVENUE BY ONE PERCENTAGE POINT. 
PepsiCo predicted yesterday that its $13.3bn acquisition of Quaker Oats would increase earnings and revenues 
by one percentage point, in spite of slower growth expectations for the Gatorade sports drink brand. 
Roger Enrico, chairman and chief executive of PepsiCo, said he did not rule out job cuts, but if there were any 
they would not be large. 
"Quaker won't be a public company any more and so there will be some modest changes from that," he said. 
Pepsi was also likely to sell or discontinue its All-Sport drinks brand if the US regulatory authorities raised 
monopoly concerns. 
PepsiCo was forced to halt its $4bn stock repurchase programme - announced only two weeks ago - in 
compliance with US regulations. Mr Enrico said it was too early to say whether repurchasing shares would 
resume after the mandatory two-year period following completion of the purchase. 
PepsiCo offered 2.3 shares for each Quaker stock, capping the transaction at $105 per share. If PepsiCo's stock 
falls below $40 before the deal is completed by the first half of the year, Quaker has the option of walking away. 
In early afternoon trading, PepsiCo's shares rose $2.12 to $44.50. Quaker shares increased $2.38 to $91. Apart 
from taking the $1.8bn Gatorade brand, the transaction is expected to increase the operating profit of PepsiCo's 
Tropicana juice drinks business by using Quaker's warehouse delivery system. 
Mr Enrico estimated that in five years, leveraging Quaker's warehouse system would translate into $400m more 
revenues and a $45m increase in profits. 
Overall, PepsiCo expects to save about $230m over the next five years from the deal, which gives the food and 
beverage giant an automatic dominance in the sports drink market. 
Quaker's Gatorade brand has an 85 per cent share of the US sports drink market. However, Mr Enrico noted that 
the company expected Gatorade to grow slightly more slowly. 
PepsiCo's initial offer was rejected in early November after the company refused to offer price protection. It 
received a second chance after Quaker's subsequent negotiations with Coca-Cola and Danone fell apart. 
The combined company is expected to generate revenues of $25bn, with a market capitalisation of $80bn. As a 
result of the transaction, Mr Enrico predicted that annual revenues would rise 7 per cent against the previous 6 
per cent projections and earnings per share would increase by 13 to 14 per cent, against 12 to 13 per cent growth 
in the past.

NEW YORK -- PepsiCo Inc.'s acquisition of Quaker Oats Co. means Steve Reinemund will take over the reins of 
the giant soft drink and snack food conglomerate almost two years earlier than planned. 
Two months ago, PepsiCo chief executive Roger Enrico, 55, announced that Mr. Reinemund would succeed him 
sometime next year and then become chairman in 2002 when Mr. Enrico retires. 
But now Mr. Reinemund, 52, gets the whole oat bag as soon as the Quaker deal closes, sometime in the first or 
second quarter of 2001. 
At that time, Mr. Enrico will become joint vice-chairman of PepsiCo along with Quaker chairman Robert Morrison. 
Analyst Emanuel Goldman, of ING Barings, said the significance of the Quaker deal was not only that Pepsi 
would acquire the highly prized Gatorade sports drink brand, but also "Roger calling it a day so early and Steve 
taking over." 
During a conference call with analysts yesterday, Mr. Reinemund said Mr. Enrico's decision to turn over the reins 
showed the "depth of his personal loyalty to Pepsi." 
Mr. Enrico, who gave birth to the "Pepsi Generation," likes to sing Sinatra songs, mentor young executives and 
take fishing trips. 
Mr. Reinemund, a former Marine and avid marathon runner who prefers starched white shirts, has a reputation as 
a somewhat stiff executive concerned with little beyond the bottom line. 
"I always believed, frankly, that Steve was the guy," Mr. Enrico said in October when asked about his number 
two, who is currently PepsiCo's president and chief operating officer. 
"But it was important for him to come up here and get accustomed and accommodated to corporate life." 
Until last year, Mr. Reinemund was chairman and chief executive of Frito-Lay Co., PepsiCo's largest business. He 
has been on the PepsiCo board of directors since 1996. 
"Certainly, over the past year or so, he took to it like a duck to water," said Mr. Enrico, a 29-year veteran of 
PepsiCo and the "cola wars" with rival Coca-Cola Co. 
J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher said of Mr. Reinemund: "He's known for strong fiscal discipline and that's what 
has really sort of turned Pepsi around over the past couple of quarters, and so I think people will be encouraged 
by this move." 
Mr. Reinemund started his career with PepsiCo in 1984 at the corporation's former Pizza Hut division, where he 
served as chief executive from 1986 to 1992. 
Mr. Enrico once joked that Mr. Reinemund focuses so much on the bottom line that he had once dubbed him 
"one-ply."

But he publicly praised his number two this year, saying: "I told the board, when Steve says he'll deal with an 
issue, I conclude that it's better than I would have done it." 
Black & White Photo: John Keating, Agence France-Presse / Upon completion of the Quaker acquisition, the new 
PepsiCo management team will include, from left to right, Indra Nooyi, who will become president and CFO, 
Robert Morrison, who will be a vice-chairman, while continuing as Quaker's chairman and CEO, PepsiCo 
chairman and CEO Roger Enrico, who also will remain as a vice-chairman, and Steve Reinemund, who will 
become chairman and CEO.

PEPSICO chairman and chief executive Roger Enrico, 55, is to step down earlier than expected, the company 
announced as it confirmed the $13.4 billion acquisition of Quaker Oats. He was to step down as chief executive

now become chairman and chief executive when the deal is completed.

PepsiCo Inc., ending a closely watched takeover saga during which rival Coca-Cola Co. nearly walked away with 
the prize, sealed a deal to acquire Quaker Oats Co. for $13.4 billion in stock and set in motion a series of 
management changes related to the deal. 
Under the terms of the deal, PepsiCo will offer 2.3 of its shares for each share of Quaker. PepsiCo shares were 
up 4.2%, or $1.75, at $44.13, in midday trading Monday. Quaker shares were up 2.5%, or $2.25, to $90.88. 
PepsiCo also is expected to assume about $761 million of debt. 
In an interview Sunday, Roger Enrico, PepsiCo's chairman and chief executive, said he is accelerating his 
previously disclosed succession plan by handing over both titles to President Steven Reinemund as soon as the 
deal with Quaker closes, expected in early part of next year. A few months ago, Mr. Enrico announced he would 
retire as CEO at the end of next year and step aside as chairman at the end of 2002. Instead, he will stay on 
PepsiCo's board and hold the title of vice chairman. In an effort to ensure Quaker is smoothly integrated into 
PepsiCo, Mr. Enrico has persuaded Robert Morrison, who as Quaker's chairman and CEO engineered a major 
turnaround of that company, to remain with the combined company as a vice chairman with continued 
responsibility for the Quaker businesses. Mr. Morrison and Mr. Enrico both will report to Mr. Reinemund. At the 
same time, Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's well-regarded chief financial officer and a close ally of Mr. Reinemund, will add 
the title of president, firmly placing her as PepsiCo's No. 2. Both Ms. Nooyi and Mr. Morrison will join PepsiCo's 
board. 
The exchange ratio for the Quaker deal is the same as PepsiCo, of Purchase, New York, offered one month ago, 
when discussions fell apart because of price disagreements. Quaker, of Chicago, had wanted a "collar" that 
would have adjusted the ratio for fluctuations in PepsiCo's stock price, and PepsiCo was unwilling to offer that 
protection. Under the agreement that was struck, the two sides have agreed to some price safeguards. Should 
PepsiCo stock fall to less than $40 a share -- which would translate to $92 a Quaker share -- for 10 random days 
during the month prior to closing, Quaker can walk away, unless PepsiCo chooses to offer at least $92 a share. 
Similarly, PepsiCo's bid is capped at $105 a Quaker share, so if PepsiCo stock rises to more than $45.65 a 
share, Quaker shareholders would get just $105 a share. 
The combined company will be 83% owned by PepsiCo shareholders and 17% by Quaker shareholders. Should 
Quaker terminate the deal or be sold to another company, PepsiCo would receive a $420 million breakup fee. 
The deal puts the valuable Gatorade brand in the PepsiCo portfolio and substantially boosts PepsiCo's presence 
in the business of selling noncarbonated beverages, a segment that is dwarfed in size by fizzy drinks but is 
growing three times as fast. Mr. Enrico said he estimates PepsiCo, with brands such as Aquafina water and SoBe 
drinks, will have a 25% share of the noncarbonated segment. 
The transaction is subject to regulatory approval, and some analysts have questioned whether PepsiCo will 
encounter problems because it owns All-Sport, the No. 3 brand, with a 3% share, compared with 83% for 
Gatorade and 12% for Coca-Cola's Powerade. PepsiCo has agreed to dispose of All-Sport if regulators insist it do 
so.

PepsiCo snaps up Quaker for Pounds 9.3bn

PEPSICO, the world's second-biggest soft drinks maker, today ended months of speculation by confirming it is 
buying Quaker Oats for $13.4 billion (Pounds 9.3 billion) in shares. 
The deal follows a protracted battle for Quaker, which has also seen Coca-Cola and France's Danone consider 
bids. The main prize for Pepsi is top-selling sports drink Gatorade, which has more than 80% of the US sports 
drinks market. 
Pepsi is offering 2.3 of its shares for each of Quaker's, issuing about 315 million new shares in total. 
Based on Friday's closing price, that values Quaker at $97.46 a share. The offer is unchanged from Pepsi's 
previous bid just over a month ago, which Quaker rejected. 
But, crucially, the new offer includes a price protection clause that allows Quaker to walk away from the deal if 
Pepsi shares drop below $40. If that happened, Pepsi would have to raise its offer to $92 per Quaker share to 
keep the deal alive. 
The offer is capped at $105 a Quaker share. If Pepsi's shares rise higher than $45.65 each, Quaker 
shareholders will still get $105 a share. 
Pepsi said that the merged company would retain the Pepsi name and added that it expects the deal to be 
finalised in the first half of next year. 
Pepsi has been keen to acquire Gatorade, the energy drink that is the outstanding asset in a portfolio that also 
includes Sugar Puffs and the oat cereal from which Quaker takes its name. Gatorade has an 86% share of the 
US sports drinks market, double-digit revenue growth and, according to some analysts, a huge potential market in 
Europe. 
The drink, invented by researchers at Florida University in the 1960s, was designed to replace the fluids and 
minerals lost by American footballers. 
Pepsi will hold a third of the noncarbonated US drinks market by adding Gatorade to its portfolio. 
That would put it ahead of its arch-rival Coca-Cola, which has a fifth. 
Pepsi's current chairman and chief executive Roger Enrico will become vice chairman of the new company while 
current president Steve Reinemund will take over at the top. Quaker chairman Robert Morrison will also be a vice 
chairman.

PEPSICO, the world's second-biggest soft-drinks maker, appears to have struck a deal to buy Quaker Oats for 
$13.4 billion (Pounds 9.3 billion) in shares. 
Quaker investors will swap each of their shares for 2.3 Pepsi shares, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
That would value Quaker at $97.46 a share, about 10% more than Friday's close and 18% more than its price on 
2 November, the day news broke that Quaker was in talks with Pepsi. 
Pepsi will take on about $761 million in Quaker debt. 
The deal, which ends months of speculation over who will buy Quaker, will bring the topselling Gatorade sports 
drink into the Pepsi stable. With $1.84 billion in sales last year, Gatorade has about 84% of the US sports drinks 
market. 
Pepsi will hold a third of the non-carbonated US drinks market by adding Gatorade to its portfolio, putting it ahead 
of Coca-Cola, which holds around 20%. According to sources close to the deal, initial negotiations between Pepsi 
and Quaker broke off on 2 November, after which Quaker held talks with Coca-Cola and France's Group 
Danone. 
But after the companies dropped out, talks with Pepsi resumed and both companies' boards voted on Pepsi's 
original offer over the weekend. 
Pepsi will apparently be paid $420 million if Quaker cancels the agreement and sells itself to another company. 
But Quaker can walk away from the deal without penalty if Pepsi's shares fall below $40, which would value each 
Quaker share at $92 in the deal. 
Pepsi could make a higher offer if its shares fall to that level. 
The offer is capped at $105 a Quaker share. If Pepsi's shares rise higher than $45.65 each. 
Quaker shareholders will still get $105 a share. 
Pepsi's chairman and chief executive Roger Enrico, meanwhile, will hand over both titles to president Steven 
Reinemund as soon the the deal is finalised. 
Enrico was set to step down as CEO before the end of next year and retire as chairman before the end of 2002. 
Instead, he will stay on Pepsi's board and hold the title of vice chairman. 
The Journal said some Pepsi investors were underwhelmed by the prospect of owning Quaker. Sales of its foods 
rose by just 1% in 1999 in contrast to Gatorade, which surged by 15%. 
Some analysts said they expected Pepsi to integrate Quaker's chewy granola bars into its snacks business but to 
sell the rest of its food business after two years.

PepsiCo Inc., ending a takeover saga in which rival Coca-Cola Co. nearly walked away with the prize, sealed a 
deal to acquire Quaker Oats Co. for $13.4 billion (15.3 billion euros) in stock and set in motion a series of 
management changes. 
Both companies' boards have approved the transaction, and an announcement is expected this morning. 
In an interview, Roger Enrico, PepsiCo's chairman and chief executive, said he is accelerating his previously 
disclosed succession plan by handing over both titles to President Steven Reinemund as soon as the deal with 
Quaker closes, expected in the spring. A few months ago, Mr. Enrico announced he would retire as CEO at the 
end of next year and step aside as chairman at the end of 2002. Instead, he will stay on PepsiCo's board and 
hold the title of vice chairman. 
To make sure Quaker is smoothly integrated into PepsiCo, Mr. Enrico has persuaded Robert Morrison, who as 
Quaker's chairman and CEO engineered a major turnaround of that company, to remain with the combined 
company as a vice chairman with continued responsibility for the Quaker businesses. Mr. Morrison and Mr. 
Enrico both will report to Mr. Reinemund. At the same time, Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's well-regarded chief financial 
officer and a close ally of Mr. Reinemund, will add the title of president, firmly placing her as PepsiCo's No. 2. 
Both Ms. Nooyi and Mr. Morrison will join PepsiCo's board. 
With Mr. Morrison scheduled to step down as Quaker's chairman and CEO once the deal closes, Mr. Enrico said 
he thought he should step down simultaneously as "a parallel situation." That way, there would be a clear chain of 
command to Mr. Reinemund rather than a "long line with a pecking order," Mr. Enrico said. 
Under the terms of the deal, PepsiCo, as expected, will offer 2.3 of its shares for each share of Quaker, which 
would value Quaker at $97.46 a share based on PepsiCo's share price of $42.38 each at 4 p.m. in New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading. Those shares were down $3, or 6.6%. Quaker rose $1.69 to $88.63 a share 
in Big Board trading. PepsiCo also is expected to assume about $761 million of debt. 
The exchange ratio is the same as PepsiCo, of Purchase, New York, offered one month ago, when discussions 
fell apart due to price disagreements. Quaker, of Chicago, had wanted a "collar" that would have adjusted the 
ratio for fluctuations in PepsiCo's stock price, and PepsiCo was unwilling to offer that protection. Under the

shareholders will get just $105 a share.

deal puts the valuable Gatorade brand in the PepsiCo portfolio and substantially boosts PepsiCo's presence in 
the business of selling noncarbonated beverages, a segment that is dwarfed in size by fizzy drinks but is growing 
three times faster. Mr. Enrico said he estimates PepsiCo, with brands such as Aquafina water and SoBe drinks, 
will have a 25% share of the noncarbonated segment, one and a half times as large as Coke's portion.

PepsiCo to Acquire The Quaker Oats Company

Acquisition Creates Big Growth Opportunities and 
Synergies Across Snack and Beverage Portfolio; 
Combination Also to Accelerate Leadership Changes 
PURCHASE, N.Y. and CHICAGO, Dec. 4 /PRNewswire/ -- PepsiCo, Inc. and The Quaker Oats Company said 
today they have reached an agreement for PepsiCo to acquire Quaker in a tax-free transaction which features 
PepsiCo exchanging 2.3 shares of its stock for each share of Quaker, up to a maximum value of $105 for each 
Quaker share. There is no guaranteed price protection or "collar." However, if the value to Quaker shareholders 
falls below $92 per share, there is a provision for Quaker to exit the deal without penalty. 
The addition of Quaker is expected to be accretive to PepsiCo's earnings per share in the first full year and 
thereafter. The acquisition will immediately improve PepsiCo's return on invested capital by 200 basis points. The 
addition of Quaker will also enhance PepsiCo's ongoing sales and profit growth rates. The transaction will be 
accounted for as a pooling of interests and is expected to close in the first half of next year, subject to approval by 
PepsiCo and Quaker shareholders and expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust waiting period and other 
customary approvals. PepsiCo also said the stock transaction would require the issuance of approximately 315 
million new shares to Quaker shareholders. 
"This will be a truly outstanding combination," said Roger A. Enrico, PepsiCo Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer. "Bringing together Quaker and PepsiCo creates a wealth of exciting growth opportunities as well as 
important cost and selling synergies. It is also very consistent with our sharp focus on convenient food and 
beverages." 
Quaker Chairman Robert S. Morrison said, "Over the last three years, The Quaker Oats Company has outpaced 
the growth of the U.S. food and beverage industry. It's a testament to our strong brands, talented people and 
operating effectiveness. Combining with the world-renowned PepsiCo organization will unleash the tremendous 
global growth potential of the Gatorade brand and leverage the strengths of our foods business." 
Roger Enrico also announced today that the PepsiCo board has accepted his recommendation to make several 
management changes when the transaction closes. 
"As this deal got closer to becoming a reality, our focus shifted to implementation and that's all about leadership, 
which is another great asset that PepsiCo and Quaker share," Enrico said. "Bob Morrison and the entire Quaker 
management team have done an outstanding job and we are looking forward to welcoming them to PepsiCo." 
"Thinking about Bob's role led me to reconsider my role and that of Steve Reinemund, our President and Chief 
Operating Officer, who we'd already decided would succeed me as CEO and Chairman," Enrico continued. "It 
became clear that Bob and I should share the same priorities -- working closely with Steve to ensure that PepsiCo 
stays on the steady course we've engineered over the last four years, and that the Quaker integration is quickly 
accretive from the top line to the bottom line and from a cash flow and people standpoint." 
"That led me to recommend several important moves to the Board, which they intend to make when the deal is 
completed. Bob Morrison and I will become Vice Chairmen, and Steve Reinemund will become Chairman and 
CEO. In addition, PepsiCo's Chief Financial Officer, Indra Nooyi, will become President at that time, while 
retaining her Chief Financial Officer responsibilities." 
"My commitment to PepsiCo is exactly the same and my timing has not changed," said Enrico. "Steve and I will 
continue working together closely as we have been this past year, sharing responsibilities for leading and running 
the company. Bob will join us in that partnership and we both look forward to working with him." Morrison, who will 
be nominated for election to the Board, will continue to serve as Chairman, President and CEO of Quaker when it

Page 52 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
becomes part of PepsiCo. Quaker will continue to be operated out of Chicago with Morrison's current leadership 
team. 
In her new role as President and CFO, Nooyi will also be nominated for election to the Board. She will be 
responsible for corporate staff functions, including legal, human resources and corporate communications, in 
addition to her current CFO duties overseeing finance, strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions, information 
technology, advanced technologies and procurement. "Indra's contributions to PepsiCo have been enormous and 
she will make a great President," said Enrico. "She is a terrific addition to our world-class board and her 
perspective will be invaluable." 
The acquisition of 
Quaker provides PepsiCo with several key strategic and 
economic benefits: 
* Quaker's powerful Gatorade brand, the world's number one sports drink, 
will make PepsiCo the clear leader in non-carbonated beverages, the 
fastest growing sector of the beverage industry. Additionally, 
leveraging the much larger scale of Gatorade's vast warehouse 
distribution system will enable PepsiCo's Tropicana juice unit to gain 
the scale it needs to make its ambient juice brands stronger and more 
profitable. 
* Quaker's rapidly expanding snack business -- including granola bars, 
rice snacks and fruit and oatmeal bars -- is highly complementary to 
PepsiCo's Frito-Lay unit, the world leader in salty snacks. The Quaker 
brand will extend PepsiCo's reach into morning on-the-go meal occasions, 
snacks aimed at kids and grain-based snacks. Distributing Quaker's 
snacks through Frito-Lay's vast distribution system will create very 
substantial growth opportunities both in the U.S. and internationally. 
* Quaker's highly profitable non-snack food business (with leading brands 
like Quaker Oatmeal, Life and Cap'n Crunch cereals, Rice a Roni and Aunt 
Jemima syrup) generates hundreds of millions of dollars in cash, and 
through increased innovation and efficiencies can continue to provide 
steady profit growth and substantial free cash flow. 
Combining PepsiCo and Quaker will create a company with an exceptionally strong position in the rapidly 
growing market for convenient foods and beverages. The combined company, which will retain the PepsiCo 
name, will have pro forma revenues of $25 billion. Its expected market capitalization of more than $80 billion will 
place it among the world's five largest consumer products companies. 
Merrill Lynch served as advisor to PepsiCo, Inc. and Goldman Sachs served as lead advisor to Quaker Oats. JP 
Morgan also served as an advisor to Quaker Oats. 
PepsiCo will hold a presentation for investors regarding the transaction that will be available via webcast and 
telephone at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) today. Investors interested in accessing the webcast may do so 
through PepsiCo's website (www.PepsiCo.com) or directly at

telephone should call 1-800-946-0719, the reservation number required for the call is 496950. The presentation 
will be repeated for those interested in listening later.

a Quaker share. If Pepsi's shares rise higher than $45.65 each. Quaker shareholders will still get $105 a 
share.Pepsi's chairman and chief executive Roger Enrico, meanwhile, will hand over both titles to president 
Steven Reinemund as soon the the deal is finalised. Enrico was set to step down as CEO before the end of next 
year and retire as chairman before the end of 2002. Instead, he will stay on Pepsi's board and hold the title of vice 
chairman.The Journal said some Pepsi investors were underwhelmed by the prospect of owning Quaker. Sales 
of its foods rose by just 1% in 1999 in contrast to Gatorade, which surged by 15%. Some analysts said they 
expected Pepsi to integrate Quaker's chewy granola bars into its snacks business but to sell the rest of its food 
business after two years.

NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc. on Monday said it will buy Quaker Oats Co. in a $13.4 billion stock 
deal that gives the world's No. 2 beverage company Quaker's Gatorade, the top-selling sports drink, and expands 
its possibilities for food business growth. 
The deal ends weeks of speculation over who might acquire Quaker, which was almost scooped up by No. 1 
beverage maker Coca-Cola Co. just weeks ago. Days later, French food group Danone also backed away from 
buying Quaker. 
Investors seem pleased with the deal, which moves PepsiCo into the No. 1 spot in the noncarbonated beverage 
sector, sending shares of both PepsiCo and Quaker climbing. 
In afternoon trading, shares of Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo gained $1-1/16, or 2.5 percent, to $43-7/16, and 
Chicago-based Quaker jumped $2-3/16, or 2.5 percent, to $90-13/16. Both traded higher earlier in the day. 
"Pepsi has the best portfolio now for non-carbs, including the water," said Greg Fontana, who tracks the food 
industry for John Hancock Funds, referring to PepsiCo's Aquafina brand. which is showing tremendous growth. 
PepsiCo, whose Pepsi-Cola Co. is the perennial No. 2 behind archrival Coca-Cola, expects to add 1 to 2 cents to 
earnings per share in the first 12 months after the deal closes and sees 13 percent to 14 percent earnings growth 
going forward. 
The deal was largely seen as a way for PepsiCo to enhance its second-largest line of products, beverages. But 
PepsiCo is also adding powerful brand names it to its Frito-Lay Co. unit, which accounts for almost 62 percent of 
company sales, with the likes of Quaker's Chewy Granola bars. 
The deal is being accounted for as a pooling of interests and is expected to be completed in the first half of next 
year, along with some major management changes. 
The combined entity is expected to have a market value of more than $80 billion, which will place it among the 
world's five largest consumer products companies, the companies said. 
The offer of 2.3 PepsiCo shares for each Quaker share matches a PepsiCo bid Quaker reportedly rejected in 
November. 
Based on Friday's closing price, PepsiCo's offer is valued at $97.46 per Quaker share, representing a 10 percent 
premium over Quaker's Friday closing price of $88-5/8. 
If the value to Quaker shareholders falls below $92 per share, Quaker may exit the deal without penalty, the 
companies said. Also, PepsiCo's offer is capped at $105 a Quaker share. 
The transaction will require the issuance of about 315 million new shares to Quaker shareholders, the companies 
said. Quaker is halting a share buyback program it already had in place and PepsiCo rescinded its plans for a 
new program. 
EXECUTIVE CHANGES 
PepsiCo Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Roger Enrico now plans to step down from his current posts 
earlier than originally planned, but a company spokesman said he still plans to leave at the end of 2002.

Page 60 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Once the deal is complete, Enrico and Quaker Chairman and CEO Robert Morrison will become vice chairmen of 
PepsiCo. 
PepsiCo President Steven Reinemund will become the company's chairman and CEO when the deal is complete, 
and Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's chief financial officer, will expand her duties and assume the additional post of 
president. 
"The big news at this point is not Gatorade," Emanuel Goldman, beverage analyst at ING Barings, said late on 
Sunday, when sources said a deal was definite. "It's Roger (Enrico) calling it a day so early, and Steve 
(Reinemund) taking over." 
Morrison and Nooyi will be nominated for election to PepsiCo's board and Morrison will stay on in his Quaker 
roles. 
Quaker will continue to be operated from Chicago and the combined company, which will retain the PepsiCo 
name, will have $25 billion in proforma revenues, the firms said. 
THE BEVERAGES 
Gatorade, the clear leader in the sports drink arena ahead of Coca-Cola's Powerade and PepsiCo's All-Sport, has 
been seen by analysts as a potentially wonderful addition to PepsiCo's noncarbonated lineup, which includes 
Aquafina and FruitWorks. 
And with PepsiCo's international presence, it can reach further overseas, where it is not a household name. 
Gatorade draws about 80 percent of its sales and 97 percent of its operating income from the United States and 
Canada. 
Carbonated soft drinks, such as Pepsi and Mountain Dew, are still the mainstay of PepsiCo's beverage business, 
but sales of noncarbonated beverages such as bottled water are growing at a rapid clip as consumers' tastes 
become more varied. 
Furthermore, Tropicana Products Inc., the leader in the branded juice market, continues to post strong sales and 
will now benefit from Gatorade's vast distribution network. 
During a Monday morning conference call, Enrico said PepsiCo sees significant sales and profit increases for its 
Tropicana line within a few years of the acquisition. 
"This is a major slug for them. It's not just the amount of volume, it's the kind of volume," Goldman said. 
PepsiCo sees net incremental growth of $400 million in additional revenue from the Tropicana line by year five of 
the deal, the PepsiCo chairman and chief executive said. 
PepsiCo also sees Tropicana's ambient, or shelf-stable, brands such as Tropicana Twister adding $45 million, 
pretax, to earnings by year five. 
In October, PepsiCo bought 90 percent of South Beach Beverage Co, maker of the SoBe line of herb and vitamin 
enhanced drinks, a company Coca-Cola had been pursuing. 
According to Merrill Lynch analyst Doug Lane, PepsiCo's share in the noncarbonated beverages arena, with 
Gatorade and SoBe, will be more than 1.5 times that of Coca-Cola. 
PepsiCo now gets 27.2 percent of revenue from Pepsi-Cola, 11 percent from Tropicana and the remainder from 
Frito-Lay, the company's largest and most profitable division. 
THE FOODS 
PepsiCo expects to double the growth rate for Quaker's snack foods business, Enrico said. 
Analysts, who had thought Quaker was too small to expand globally on its own, seem confident that PepsiCo will 
keep the food businesses, even slow growth areas such as cereals. 
Quaker's "much berated food businesses, including Quaker Oatmeal, Life and Cap'n Crunch cereals and 
Rice-A-Roni, are in fact highly profitable and generate strong free cash flows," UBS Warburg beverage analyst 
Caroline Levy said in a research note. "We do not expect (PepsiCo) to sell these businesses, even after the two 
year waiting period mandated by the pooling transaction."

NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc. on Monday said it will buy Quaker Oats Co. in a stock deal worth 
around $13.8 billion that gives the world's No. 2 beverage company Quaker's Gatorade, the top-selling sports 
drink, and expands its possibilities for food business growth. 
The deal ends weeks of speculation over who might acquire Quaker, which was almost scooped up by No. 1 
beverage maker Coca-Cola Co. just weeks ago. Days later, French food group Danone also backed away from 
buying Quaker. 
Investors seem pleased with the deal, which will make PepsiCo No. 1 in the noncarbonated beverage sector. 
After trading higher, shares of Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo closed up $1-7/16, or 3.4 percent, at $43-13/16, 
and Chicago-based Quaker jumped $2-7/16, or 2.75 percent, to $91-1/16. 
"This is a really first class acquisition," ING Barings beverage analyst Emanuel Goldman said. 
PepsiCo, whose Pepsi-Cola Co. is the perennial No. 2 behind archrival Coca-Cola, expects to add 1 to 2 cents to 
earnings per share in the first 12 months after the deal closes and sees 13 percent to 14 percent earnings growth

PepsiCo is also adding powerful brand names to its Frito-Lay Co. unit, which accounts for almost 62 percent of 
company sales, with the likes of Quaker's Chewy Granola bars. 
PepsiCo has no plans to sell off Quaker's food businesses, President Steve Reinemund said in a phone 
interview, though some analysts expect some of the food business to eventually be sold. 
The deal is being accounted for as a pooling of interests and is expected to be completed in the first half of next 
year, along with some major management changes. 
The combined entity is expected to have a market value of more than $80 billion, which will place it among the 
world's five largest consumer products companies, the companies said. 
The offer of 2.3 PepsiCo shares for each Quaker share matches a PepsiCo bid Quaker reportedly rejected in 
November. 
Based on Monday's closing price, PepsiCo's offer is valued at $100.77 per Quaker share, representing an almost 
11 percent premium over Quaker's share price. Given that Quaker's outstanding diluted shares at Sept 30 
totaled almost 137.3 million, the deal is valued at around $13.83 billion. 
PepsiCo's offer is capped at $105 a Quaker share. If the value to Quaker shareholders falls below $92 per share, 
Quaker may exit the deal without penalty, the companies said. 
The transaction will require the issuance of about 315 million new shares to Quaker shareholders, the companies 
said. Quaker is halting a share buyback program it already had in place and PepsiCo rescinded its plans for a

Reinemund said PepsiCo is not sure what will become of All-Sport, which holds less than 3 percent of the its 
market. 
"We'll sort of cross that bridge when we get to it," he said. 
With PepsiCo's international presence, Gatorade can reach further overseas, where it is not a household name.

(c) 2000 Reuters Limited 
CHICAGO, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Cap'n Crunch may be looking for a new flag to sail under in about two years. 
That brand, as well as other cereals, Rice-A-Roni side dishes and Aunt Jemima pancake mixes and syrups, will 
become part of PepsiCo Inc. after it completes its $13.4 billion acquisition of food and beverage maker Quaker 
Oats Co. , which was announced Monday. 
But their stay in the PepsiCo portfolio could be temporary, analysts said. 
"I would guess after two years, they probably sell off most of the nonsnack portion of Quaker," William Leach, 
food industry analyst at Banc of America Securities, said. 
For PepsiCo, the No. 2 beverage maker behind Coca-Cola Co. , the jewel in the Quaker crown is sports drink 
Gatorade. But 60 percent of Quaker's sales come from food, mostly from brands that do not fit naturally with 
PepsiCo's Frito-Lay snacks business. 
Because Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo plans to account for the acquisition of Chicago-based Quaker as a 
pooling of interests, it will be prohibited from selling parts of Quaker for about two years, analysts said. NOT A 
STRATEGIC FIT 
Some of the Quaker food business, like chewy granola bars and rice cakes, could fit well in the PepsiCo snack 
business. 
But others do not fit into PepsiCo's three core areas: sodas and other "refreshment beverages," enhanced or 
functional beverages like Gatorade, and snack foods. 
During a conference call with analysts and investors, PepsiCo Chairman and Chief Executive Roger Enrico said 
that the company would not expand that focus, though he did not say if the nonsnack food lines would eventually 
be sold. 
"We have no plans, no intention for nonsnack foods to evolve into a fourth strategic leg for PepsiCo," Enrico said. 
But he also added that Quaker's $2.6 billion nonsnack food business "is a good business," with predictable 
earnings and occasional "upside" surprises. The businesses also generate a lot of cash, he said. 
Steve Reinemund, the PepsiCo president and chief operating officer who is Enrico's designated successor, told 
Reuters later that the company has no plans to sell any of the food business. 
In fact, one analyst said that with two years to watch the business, PepsiCo may decide in the end that it is 
profitable enough to keep. 
But most investors and analysts think a sale of the nonsnack food business is likely, especially after Enrico and 
Quaker Chairman Robert Morrison, who will both become vice chairman after the deal, eventually leave the 
company. 
"It could be that after Roger and Bob exit the company, then Steve and Indra will meet to make the decision to 
exit the nonsnack foods," Greg Fontana, who follows the food industry for John Hancock funds, said. PepsiCo 
chief financial officer Indra Nooyi is slated to become president after the deal closes. PLENTY OF BUYERS

Page 66 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
If the company does decide to sell some of the food business, there would be plenty of suitors, analysts said. 
Potential buyers for all or some of the nonsnack food businesses range from Philip Morris Cos. Inc.'s Kraft Foods 
unit and diversified food company ConAgra Foods Inc. to European companies like Nestle SA and Unilever Plc. . 
Even U.S. cereal leaders General Mills Inc. and Kellogg Co. could bid for some of the business in two years, 
provided the new U.S. president brings in leadership at the Federal Trade Commission that is less rigid in its 
interpretation of antitrust law, analysts said. 
PepsiCo also faces the challenge of what to do with food businesses it may sell in two years, especially when 
they are not part of the company's core business lines. 
"Certainly, it's already tagged as noncore," Patrick Schumann, analyst at Edward Jones said. "I would not expect 
a whole lot of support" for the businesses. 
In the short term, PepsiCo could maximize profits from the business by cutting down on promotional costs. But 
longer-term, the company might need to spend to gain market share to make the business more attractive for 
sale. 
"The first year, they probably milk it for profitability and in the second year, you increase your promotion," Terry 
Bivens, food industry analyst at Bear, Stearns, said.

(c) 2000 Reuters Limited 
CHICAGO, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Soft drink and snack foods maker PepsiCo Inc. on Monday said its acquisition of 
Quaker Oats Co. would boost its earnings and revenue growth rates. 
The deal would increase PepsiCo's earnings by 1 to 2 cents a share in the 12 months after closing, Roger Enrico, 
PepsiCo chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts and investors. 
PepsiCo estimates acquisition costs at about $400 million in the first two years after the deal closes, Enrico said, 
but the estimate will be refined over the next few months. The deal is expected to close in the first or second 
quarter of 2001. 
PepsiCo's earnings growth will rise to between 13 and 14 percent annually after the deal, from a previous 12 to 
13 percent target, Enrico said. Increased growth would come from cost savings as well as heightened revenue 
growth when Quaker's Gatorade sports drink and PepsiCo brands like Tropicana juices are combined. 
The combined company could have revenue growth of 7 percent or more a year, the high end of PepsiCo's 
previous 6 to 7 percent growth target, Enrico said. 
PepsiCo shares were up $2-3/16, or 5 percent, at $44-9/16 near midday on the New York Stock Exchange. The 
stock has a 52-week range of $49-7/16 to $29-11/16. Quaker shares were up $2-7/16, or 2.75 percent, at 
$91-1/16. Quaker shares reached an all-time high of $98-15/16 last month on takeover speculation. 
PepsiCo and Quaker announced Monday that they agreed for PepsiCo to acquire Quaker in a deal worth $13.4 
billion. Quaker shareholders would receive 2.3 shares of PepsiCo for each Quaker share. 
PepsiCo will be able to significantly grow its Tropicana sales by using the distribution system Quaker has in place 
for Gatorade, Enrico said. 
PepsiCo, the world's No. 2 soft drink maker, sees net incremental growth of $400 million in additional revenue 
from the Tropicana line by year five of the deal, he said. 
PepsiCo also sees Tropicana's non-refrigerated brands adding $45 million, pretax, to earnings by year five, he 
said. Tropicana accounts for about 11 percent of PepsiCo's total sales. 
PepsiCo can double the growth rate of Quaker's granola bars and other snack foods, eventually adding $200 
million in revenues to that business, Enrico said. "We would expect to significantly increase the revenues of that 
snack food business," he said. 
In addition to Gatorade and snack foods, PepsiCo is also acquiring Quaker's non-snack foods, including Quaker 
oatmeal, Life cereal and Rice-A-Roni side dishes. Analysts said PepsiCo was likely to eventually sell off that 
lower-growth business. 
Enrico said during the conference call that the $2.6 billion non-snack food business was "a good business" but 
added that PepsiCo would not change its strategy of focusing its food business on snacks. 
Enrico also said the company sees $65 million in pretax cost savings by the fifth year after the deal closes.

NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc. on Monday said it will buy Quaker Oats Co. in a $13.4 billion stock 
deal that gives the world's No. 2 beverage company Quaker's Gatorade, the crown jewel of sports drinks, ending 
weeks of speculation over who might acquire Quaker. 
Investors seem pleased with the deal, which gives PepsiCo a major edge in its noncarbonated beverage battle 
against archrival and No. 1 beverage maker Coca-Cola Co., sending shares of both companies climbing in 
Monday morning trading. 
In early afternoon trading, the shares of Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo jumped $2-1/4, or 5.3 percent, to $44-5/8, 
and the shares of Chicago-based Quaker gained $2-7/16, or 2.75 percent, to $91-1/16. 
PepsiCo, whose Pepsi-Cola Co. is the perennial No. 2 behind beverage giant Coca-Cola, sees the deal adding 1 
to 2 cents to earnings per share in the first 12 months after the deal closes and sees 13 to 14 percent earnings 
growth going forward. Before the merger was announced, the company had predicted 12 to 13 percent earnings 
growth.

The combined entity is expected to have a market value of more than $80 billion, which will place it among the

The offer of 2.3 PepsiCo shares for each Quaker share matches the bid Chicago-based Quaker reportedly 
rejected from the Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo just over a month ago. 
Based on Friday's closing price, PepsiCo's offer is valued at $97.46 per Quaker share, representing a 10 percent 
premium over Quaker's Friday closing price of $88-5/8. 
The transaction will require the issuance of about 315 million new shares to Quaker shareholders, the companies 
said. Quaker is halting a share buyback program it already had in place and PepsiCo rescinded its plans for a 
new program. 
Carbonated soft drinks, such as Pepsi and Mountain Dew, are still the mainstay of the PepsiCo's beverage 
business, but sales of non-carbonated beverages such as Aquafina bottled water are growing at a rapid clip as 
consumers' tastes become more varied. 
"This will be a truly outstanding combination," Roger Enrico, PepsiCo's chairman and chief executive, said in a 
statement. "Bringing together Quaker and PepsiCo creates a wealth of exciting growth opportunities as well as 
important cost and selling synergies. It is also very consistent with our sharp focus on convenient food and 
beverages." 
Under the terms of the agreement, if the value to Quaker shareholders falls below $92 per share, Quaker may 
exit the deal without penalty, the companies said. Also, PepsiCo's offer is capped at $105 a Quaker share. 
Late last month, leading soft drink maker Coca-Cola backed away from its plans to buy Quaker. Days later, 
French food group Danone took itself out of the running for the cereal and sports drink maker.

On the executive front, Enrico said that he will step down from the chairman and CEO posts earlier than originally 
planned. 
Previously, he was set to step down as CEO before the end of 2001 and retire as chairman before the end of 
2002. 
But now, once the deal is complete, Enrico and Quaker Chairman Robert Morrison will become vice chairmen of 
PepsiCo. 
PepsiCo President Steven Reinemund will become the company's chairman and CEO at that time, and Indra 
Nooyi, PepsiCo's chief financial officer, will expand her duties and assume the additional post of president. 
"The big news at this point is not Gatorade," Emanuel Goldman, beverage analyst at ING Barings, said late on 
Sunday. "It's Roger (Enrico) calling it a day so early, and Steve (Reinemund) taking over." 
Reinemund was named Pepsi's president and chief operating officer last year after serving as chairman and CEO 
of Frito-Lay Worldwide, the company's largest and most profitable division. 
Morrison and Nooyi will be nominated for election to PepsiCo's board, the companies said. Morrison will continue 
to serve as Quaker's chairman, president and chief executive. 
Quaker will continue to be operated from Chicago and the combined company, which will retain the PepsiCo 
name, will have $25 billion in proforma revenues, the firms said. 
THE PRODUCTS 
PepsiCo currently gets the majority of its revenues from snack chips unit Frito-Lay Co. In the third quarter ended 
Sept. 2, Frito-Lay accounted for almost 62 percent of the company's revenues, Pepsi-Cola brought in 27.2 
percent, and juice maker Tropicana Products Inc., the leader in the branded juice market, made up for about 11 
percent of total sales. 
Chicago-based Quaker, whose food products include hot and cold cereals such as oatmeal and Cap'n Crunch, 
Rice-A-Roni side dishes, and Aunt Jemima pancake mix, has been the subject of merger rumors for years. It was 
thought to be too small to expand globally on its own. 
Gatorade, the clear leader in the sports drink arena ahead of Coca-Cola's Powerade and PepsiCo's All-Sport, has 
been seen by beverage analysts as a potentially wonderful addition to PepsiCo's noncarbonated product line, 
which already includes Aquafina and FruitWorks. 
During a Monday morning conference call, Enrico said PepsiCo sees significant sales and profit increases for its 
Tropicana line of beverages within a few years of the acquisition, using Gatorade's vast distribution network. 
PepsiCo also expects to double the growth rate for Quaker's snack foods business, Enrico said. 
PepsiCo sees net incremental growth of $400 million in additional revenue from the Tropicana line by year five of 
the deal, the PepsiCo chairman and chief executive said. 
PepsiCo also sees Tropicana's ambient, or shelf-stable, brands such as Tropicana Twister adding $45 million, 
pretax, to earnings by year five.

UPDATE 5-PepsiCo buys Quaker in $13.83 bln stock deal. 
UPDATE 5-PepsiCo buys Quaker in $13.83 bln stock deal.

(c) 2000 Reuters Limited 
NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc. on Monday said it will buy Quaker Oats Co. in a stock deal worth 
around $13.8 billion that gives the world's No. 2 beverage company Quaker's Gatorade, the top-selling sports 
drink, and expands its possibilities for food business growth. 
The deal ends weeks of speculation over who might acquire Quaker, which was almost scooped up by No. 1 
beverage maker Coca-Cola Co. just weeks ago. Days later, French food group Danone also backed away from 
buying Quaker. 
Investors seem pleased with the deal, which will make PepsiCo No. 1 in the noncarbonated beverage sector. 
After trading higher, shares of Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo closed up $1-7/16, or 3.4 percent, at $43-13/16, 
and Chicago-based Quaker jumped $2-7/16, or 2.75 percent, to $91-1/16. 
"This is a really first class acquisition," ING Barings beverage analyst Emanuel Goldman said. 
PepsiCo, whose Pepsi-Cola Co. is the perennial No. 2 behind archrival Coca-Cola, expects to add 1 to 2 cents to 
earnings per share in the first 12 months after the deal closes and sees 13 percent to 14 percent earnings growth 
going forward. 
The deal was largely seen as a way for PepsiCo to enhance its second-largest line of products, beverages. But 
PepsiCo is also adding powerful brand names to its Frito-Lay Co. unit, which accounts for almost 62 percent of 
company sales, with the likes of Quaker's Chewy Granola bars. 
PepsiCo has no plans to sell off Quaker's food businesses, President Steve Reinemund said in a phone 
interview, though some analysts expect some of the food business to eventually be sold. 
The deal is being accounted for as a pooling of interests and is expected to be completed in the first half of next 
year, along with some major management changes. 
The combined entity is expected to have a market value of more than $80 billion, which will place it among the 
world's five largest consumer products companies, the companies said. 
The offer of 2.3 PepsiCo shares for each Quaker share matches a PepsiCo bid Quaker reportedly rejected in 
November. 
Based on Monday's closing price, PepsiCo's offer is valued at $100.77 per Quaker share, representing an almost 
11 percent premium over Quaker's share price. Given that Quaker's outstanding diluted shares at Sept 30 
totaled almost 137.3 million, the deal is valued at around $13.83 billion. 
PepsiCo's offer is capped at $105 a Quaker share. If the value to Quaker shareholders falls below $92 per share, 
Quaker may exit the deal without penalty, the companies said. 
The transaction will require the issuance of about 315 million new shares to Quaker shareholders, the companies 
said. Quaker is halting a share buyback program it already had in place and PepsiCo rescinded its plans for a 
new program.

PepsiCo Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Roger Enrico now plans to step down from his current posts 
earlier than originally planned, but a company spokesman said he still plans to leave at the end of 2002. 
Once the deal is complete, Enrico and Quaker Chairman and CEO Robert Morrison will become vice chairmen of 
PepsiCo. 
PepsiCo President Steven Reinemund will become the company's chairman and CEO when the deal is complete, 
and Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's chief financial officer, will expand her duties and assume the additional post of 
president. 
"The thing that really counts is to keep the management, and that's what Pepsi is focusing on," Goldman said. 
Morrison and Nooyi will be nominated for election to PepsiCo's board and Morrison will stay on in his Quaker 
roles. 
Quaker will continue to be operated from Chicago and the combined company, which will retain the PepsiCo 
name, will have $25 billion in proforma revenues, the firms said. 
Reinemund said there is some overlapping in corporate positions between the companies, but gave no figures on 
possible job cuts. 
THE BEVERAGES 
Gatorade, the clear leader in the sports drink arena ahead of Coca-Cola's Powerade and PepsiCo's All-Sport, has 
been seen by analysts as a potentially wonderful addition to PepsiCo's noncarbonated lineup, which includes 
Aquafina and FruitWorks. 
Reinemund said PepsiCo is not sure what will become of All-Sport, which holds less than 3 percent of the its 
market. 
"We'll sort of cross that bridge when we get to it," he said. 
With PepsiCo's international presence, Gatorade can reach further overseas, where it is not a household name. 
Gatorade draws about 80 percent of its sales and 97 percent of its operating income from the United States and 
Canada. 
"Pepsi has the best portfolio now for non-carbs, including the water," said Greg Fontana, who tracks the food 
industry for John Hancock Funds, referring to PepsiCo's Aquafina brand, whose volume jumped 26 percent in the 
third quarter. 
Carbonated soft drinks, such as Pepsi and Mountain Dew, are still the mainstay of PepsiCo's beverage business, 
but sales of noncarbonated beverages such as bottled water are growing at a rapid clip as consumers' tastes 
become more varied. 
Furthermore, Tropicana Products Inc., the leader in the branded juice market, continues to post strong sales and 
will now benefit from Gatorade's vast distribution network. 
During a Monday morning conference call, Enrico said PepsiCo sees significant sales and profit increases for its 
Tropicana line within a few years of the acquisition. 
"This is a major slug for them. It's not just the amount of volume, it's the kind of volume," Goldman said. 
PepsiCo sees net incremental growth of $400 million in additional revenue from the Tropicana line by year five of 
the deal, the PepsiCo chairman and chief executive said. 
PepsiCo also sees Tropicana's ambient, or shelf-stable, brands such as Tropicana Twister adding $45 million, 
pretax, to earnings by year five. 
In October, PepsiCo bought 90 percent of South Beach Beverage Co, maker of the SoBe line of herb and vitamin 
enhanced drinks, a company Coca-Cola had been pursuing. 
According to Merrill Lynch analyst Doug Lane, PepsiCo's share in the noncarbonated beverages arena, with 
Gatorade and SoBe, will be more than 1.5 times that of Coca-Cola.

PepsiCo currently gets 27.2 percent of revenue from Pepsi-Cola, 11 percent from Tropicana and the remainder 
from Frito-Lay, the company's largest and most profitable division. 
THE FOODS 
PepsiCo expects to double the growth rate for Quaker's snack foods business, Enrico said. 
Analysts, who had thought Quaker was too small to expand globally on its own, seem confident that PepsiCo will 
keep the food businesses, even slow growth areas such as cereals. 
Quaker's "much berated food businesses, including Quaker Oatmeal, Life and Cap'n Crunch cereals and 
Rice-A-Roni, are in fact highly profitable and generate strong free cash flows," UBS Warburg beverage analyst 
Caroline Levy said in a research note. "We do not expect (PepsiCo) to sell these businesses, even after the two 
year waiting period mandated by the pooling transaction." 
Meanwhile, some analysts said they expect the brands' stay in the PepsiCo portfolio could be temporary.

NEWSMAKER - Quaker deal last hurrah for Pepsi's Enrico? 
NEWSMAKER - Quaker deal last hurrah for Pepsi's Enrico?

4 December 2000

LBA 
English 
(c) 2000 Reuters Limited 
NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - After surviving the "cola wars" and giving birth to the "Pepsi Generation," PepsiCo 
Inc. chief executive Roger Enrico wants to go out with a bang. 
What better way than overseeing the soft drink and snack food giant's $13.4 billion acquisition of Quaker Oats 
Co.? 
"I look upon this as the most exciting way I could possibly imagine to conclude, if you will, my career at PepsiCo 
over the next couple of years," Enrico, 55, told analysts and reporters in a conference call Monday. 
He was discussing the stock deal that would give PepsiCo top-selling Gatorade sports drink, as well as Quaker's 
well-known breakfast cereals and oatmeals, plus an array of other food brands like Rice-a-Roni and Aunt Jemima 
pancake mixes. 
The announcement came just two months after Enrico named Steve Reinemund as his successor as chief 
executive officer next year and as chairman when Enrico retires by the end of 2002. 
Now, Reinemund, who has been president and chief operating officer, will assume full control when the Quaker 
deal closes in the first or second quarter of next year. Enrico will be a vice chairman with Quaker's chairman 
Robert Morrison. 
But a PepsiCo spokesman said the change in timing made no difference to Enrico's plan to retire by the end of 
2002. 
"This earlier transition date that we're talking about between Steve and myself does not suggest a lessening of 
my commitment of time or energy to PepsiCo in any way," Enrico said Monday. 
A veteran of the Vietnam War, then the "cola wars" against arch-rival Coca-Cola Co. too, Enrico helped put the 
fizz back into PepsiCo, streamlining the world's No. 2 soft drink company by spinning off its restaurant and 
bottling businesses. 
Enrico's is a classic tale of a brash Italian-American executive's rise from humble roots to the pinnacle of one of 
America's most recognized business giants. On the way, he stepped on some corporate toes, forged a close 
relationship with the company's head and had a life-transforming heart-attack that forced him to take stock of his 
priorities. 
The son of an iron-ore worker in Chisholm, Minn., Enrico attended Babson College near Boston on a scholarship 
and earned a bachelor's degree in finance. He volunteered for the Vietnam War in 1967 and served with a supply 
unit near the front lines. 
He married his high-school sweetheart, Rosemary Margo, while on rest and recuperation leave in Hawaii in 1969. 
Their son Aaron works for a dot-com company in California. 
After the military and a brief spell at General Mills Inc., Enrico joined PepsiCo's snack food company Frito-Lay in 
1971 and has been with PepsiCo ever since. 
James O'Neill, production manager for Frito-Lay in the mid-1970's, recalled how the young executive was "just 
more aggressive and more pushy than anybody else."

Page 74 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
That brashness was evident in 1986 after rival Coca-Cola's disastrous introduction of New Coke. Enrico published 
a memoir entitled: "The Other Guy Blinked: How Pepsi Won the Cola Wars." 
With his flair for marketing, Enrico climbed the ranks at Frito-Lay and in 1983 became chief executive of 
Pepsi-Cola's U.S. business. He annoyed his bosses by not telling them he was signing Michael Jackson for $5 
million to make a commercial for the "Pepsi Generation" campaign. 
The ads, aimed at attracting hip, younger customers, helped Pepsi make up ground on Coke and the company is 
still using pop stars such as Faith Hill and sports heroes like baseball stars Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr. in its 
advertising. 
"He didn't care for supervision," said Victor Bonomo, who was head of the worldwide beverage group. "He liked to 
do his own thing." 
The turning point in Enrico's life was the mild heart attack he suffered while dancing the lambada in a Turkish 
night club in 1990. It made him rethink his priorities in a life that had until then been consumed by his career. 
Enrico, whose current stock holdings and options are worth an estimated $80 million, told Business Week he had 
become disillusioned. "I began to think, 'Well, what's money for?' It was more money than I needed to live on." 
"It has broadened him, made him more reflective and lent him a human sensitivity that he showed to few people 
before," said a friend, Gerald Roche. 
After moving back to Frito-Lay as CEO in 1991, Enrico surprised everyone by taking a 14-month sabbatical in 
1993. He set up a "college" to teach and mentor young PepsiCo executives at his Montana ranch and a retreat in 
the Cayman Islands. 
He still takes groups horseback riding or fly-fishing and in the evenings, over sambuca, Enrico has even been 
known to entertain with his Sinatra-style rendition of "My Way." 
After returning as CEO of PepsiCo's fast-food business in 1994, it was his relationship with his own mentor and 
former PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Donald Kendall that helped persuade Enrico to succeed cancer-stricken 
CEO Wayne Calloway in 1996. He reluctantly took the job and consulted regularly with Kendall over just about 
every move he made. 
In his spare time, Enrico loves to read and enjoys fishing and scuba diving.

NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc.'s acquisition of Quaker Oats Co. means Steve Reinemund will take 
over the reins of the giant soft drink and snack food conglomerate almost two years earlier than originally 
planned. 
Just two months ago, PepsiCo Chairman and Chief Executive Roger Enrico, 55, announced that Reinemund 
would succeed him as chief executive sometime next year and then become chairman in 2002 when Enrico 
retires. 
But now Reinemund, 52, gets the whole oat bag as soon as the Quaker deal closes sometime in the first or 
second quarter of 2001. At that time, Enrico will become joint vice chairman of PepsiCo along with Quaker 
Chairman Robert Morrison. 
Analyst Emanuel Goldman of ING Barings said the significance of the Quaker deal was not only that Pepsi would 
acquire the highly-prized Gatorade sports drink brand, but also "Roger calling it a day so early and Steve taking 
over." 
During a conference call with analysts on Monday, Reinemund said Enrico's decision to turn over the reins 
showed the "depth of his personal loyalty to Pepsi." 
Enrico and Reinemund could not be more different 
Enrico, who gave birth to the "Pepsi Generation," likes to sing Sinatra songs, mentor young executives and take 
fishing trips. Reinemund, an ex-Marine and avid marathon runner who prefers starched white shirts, has a 
reputation as a somewhat stiff executive concerned with little beyond the bottom line. 
"I always believed, frankly, that Steve was the guy," Enrico told Reuters in October when asked about his No. 2, 
who is currently PepsiCo's president and chief operating officer. "But it was important for him to come up here 
and get accustomed and accommodated to corporate life." 
Until last year, Reinemund was chairman and chief executive of Frito-Lay Co., PepsiCo's largest business. He 
has been on the PepsiCo board of directors since 1996. 
"Certainly, over the last year or so, he took to it like a duck to water," said Enrico, a 29-year veteran of PepsiCo 
and the "cola wars" with rival Coca-Cola Co. 
J.P Morgan analyst John Faucher said of Reinemund, "He's known for strong fiscal discipline and that's what's 
really sort of turned Pepsi around over the past couple of quarters, and so I think people will be encouraged by 
this." 
Reinemund started his career with PepsiCo in 1984 at the corporation's former Pizza Hut division, where he 
served as chief executive from 1986 to 1992. 
At Pizza Hut, he caught the eye of senior executives as a disciplined manager. He pushed Pizza Hut to expand 
beyond restaurants into delivery and buffet services. 
Later, at Frito-Lay, he almost doubled growth through innovations and acquisitions such as Cracker Jack, while 
shaving costs and reorganizing distribution.

Page 76 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Enrico once joked that Reinemund focuses so much on the bottom line that he had dubbed him "one-ply." But he 
publicly praised his No. 2 this year, saying, "I told the board, when Steve says he'll deal with an issue, I conclude 
that it's better than I would have done it. 
"He leaves very few stones unturned." 
Reinemund graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1970 and served five years in the Marine Corps, reaching 
the rank of captain. He earned a business degree from the University of Virginia in 1978. 
He has served as chairman of the national advisory board to the Salvation Army. He and his wife Gail have four 
children.

NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc. and Quaker Oats Co. said on Monday that PepsiCo agreed to buy 
Quaker in a $13.4 billion stock deal, ending more than a month of speculation over who might acquire cereal and 
sports drink maker Quaker. 
The following is a chronology of the key events in the recent courting of Quaker. 
Nov 2, 2000 - It is reported that Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo, the maker of Frito-Lay chips, Pepsi-Cola soft 
drinks and Tropicana juices, has been holding talks to acquire Chicago-based Quaker, for about $13 billion in 
stock, or the equivalent of about $100 a share, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Nov 2 - Later on Nov 2, the Wall Street Journal reports in its electronic edition that PepsiCo walked away from 
Quaker after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on price. 
Nov 9 - Quaker shares fall nearly 3 percent when no new developments involving a possible sale of the company 
emerged a day after it held a board meeting. 
Nov 15 - PepsiCo Chief Financial Officer Indra Nooyi, speaking at an industry conference, leaves the door open 
to future acquisitions, without specifically mentioning Quaker. After her comments, PepsiCo shares slide and 
Quaker shares jump. 
Nov 19 - Leading soft drink maker Coca-Cola Co. is said to be in intensive discussions to acquire Quaker, 
offering about $15 billion in a deal which would value Quaker at $115 per share, according to sources. 
It is also believed that French food group Danone SA is interested in acquiring Quaker. 
Nov 20 - Coca-Cola confirms it is in talks to buy Quaker. 
Nov 21 - Coca-Cola says it will not pursue a transaction with Quaker after a meeting of Coca-Cola's board of 
directors. 
Nov 22 - Danone says it is interested in Quaker and is reviewing the situation. 
Nov 23 - Danone says it has decided not to pursue a transaction with Quaker. 
Nov 30 - PepsiCo is reported to again be in talks to buy Quaker, in a deal then valued at $14.3 billion in stock, 
with PepsiCo offering 2.3 of its shares for each Quaker share. 
Dec 4 - PepsiCo says it would buy Quaker for 2.3 PepsiCo shares for each Quaker share. The combined entity is 
expected to have a market value of more than $80 billion. 
PepsiCo Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Roger Enrico and Quaker Chairman and CEO Robert Morrison 
would become vice chairmen on completion of the deal. Morrison would also continue to serve as Quaker's 
chairman, president and CEO. 
PepsiCo President Steven Reinemund would become the combined company's chairman and CEO on 
completion of the deal and CFO Nooyi would expand her duties and assume the additional post of president.

NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc. expects significant sales and profit increases for its Tropicana line of 
beverages within a few years of the acquisition of Quaker Oats Co. through use of the distribution network for 
Quaker's Gatorade drink, PepsiCo chief Roger Enrico said on Monday. 
PepsiCo also expects to double the growth rate for Quaker's snack foods business, Enrico said in a conference 
call with analysts and investors. 
PepsiCo, the world's No. 2 soft drink maker, sees net incremental growth of $400 million in additional revenue 
from the Tropicana line by year five of the deal, the PepsiCo chairman and chief executive said. 
PepsiCo also sees Tropicana's ambient, or shelf-stable, brands adding $45 million, pre-tax, to earnings by year 
five, he said. Tropicana, which accounts for about 11 percent of PepsiCo's total sales, sells ambient brands such 
as Tropicana Twister. 
Enrico also said the company sees $65 million in pre-tax cost-cutting savings by year five of the deal. 
In early trading, shares of Purchase, N.Y-based PepsiCo were up 9/16 at $42-15/16 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, and shares of Chicago-based Quaker were up $1-3/8 at $90.

CHICAGO, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Soft drink and snacks maker PepsiCo Inc. said Monday that its planned $13.4 
billion acquisition of Quaker Oats Co. would add 1 to 2 cents to earnings per share in the first 12 months after the 
deal closes. 
PepsiCo Chairman and Chief Executive Roger Enrico told analysts during a conference call that the deal, 
announced Monday, should not add much to 2001 earnings guidance, as most savings will not happen until 2002. 
The deal is expected to close in the first or second quarter of 2001. 
Analysts on average forecast earnings of $1.64 a share for PepsiCo in 2001 and $1.86 a share in 2002, up from 
an estimated $1.45 a share in 2000, according to market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial.

CHICAGO, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Soft drink and snack foods maker PepsiCo Inc. said on Monday that its earnings 
and revenue growth rates would increase after its proposed $13.4 billion acquisition of Quaker Oats Co. closes. 
PepiCo's earnings growth would rise to 13-14 percent annually from a previous 12-13 percent target, Roger 
Enrico, PepsiCo chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. Increased growth would 
come from cost savings, as well as heightened revenue growth when Quaker's Gatorade sports drink and 
PepsiCo brands like Tropicana juices are combined. 
The combined company also could have revenue growth of 7 percent a year, the high end of PepsiCo's previous 
6-7 percent growth target, Enrico said. 
The two companies announced Monday that they agreed on PepsiCo's acquisition of Quaker, with Quaker 
shareholders receiving 2.3 shares of PepsiCo for each Quaker share.

There is no question that PepsiCo Inc. wanted Quaker Oats Co. for its powerhouse Gatorade sports drink. But 
Pepsi is also looking forward to munching on Quaker's snack foods. 
Quaker's food business, which makes up about 60% of its revenue, is highly profitable, and some of its products 
can enhance Pepsi's goal of becoming the leading seller of convenience foods and beverages, PepsiCo 
executives say. 
With its $13.4 billion purchase of Quaker, the Purchase, N.Y., snack-food and beverage titan sees a bright future 
in Quaker's small but growing business in chewy granola and other bars, as well as its rice cakes. PepsiCo 
already has been working on expanding its Frito-Lay division, which made up 62% of the company's sales last 
year, beyond the salty and other snack markets it dominates into "on the go" light meals and nutritious snacks. 
Owning Quaker's bar business will give the company an instant entry into the morning "daypart," where Pepsi 
sees a lot of opportunity as consumers increasingly skip breakfast and eat on the go, PepsiCo Chairman Roger 
Enrico said in an interview. "As important as the Gatorade brand is, we believe the Quaker brand provides future 
scale for us," Mr. Enrico said. "The on-the-go minimeal concept is manifesting itself in bars. . . . Minimeals are 
more and more the way people are taking in nutrition." 
"You have to have a 10-year-old kid to know how hot those chewy granola bars are right now," John McMillin, a 
Prudential Securities analyst, said. 
Mr. Enrico said PepsiCo would look for opportunities for innovation with bars, but it added that just putting such 
snacks into Frito-Lay's massive distribution system, which recently has been re-engineered to allow for even 
greater capacity, would significantly increase sales. Quaker's snacks make up about 3% of the company's 
revenue. "We can use Frito-Lay's capability to add significantly to the business Quaker already has," Mr. Enrico 
said. 
PepsiCo's plans for Chicago-based Quaker's other food businesses, which include slow-growth products such as 
cold cereal as well as such highly profitable businesses as oatmeal, are more modest. Mr. Enrico said PepsiCo 
has no plans either to sell such businesses after two years or spin them off. He said PepsiCo had factored 
conservative profit growth of about 4.5% for such foods. 
"These businesses clearly do not fit with our convenient-beverage-and-food strategy," he said. Nevertheless, he 
said, "We will run them on an even keel as they have done. Given our plan and expectations, we feel that this is a 
manageable part of portfolio." 
PepsiCo can capitalize on some of the better-known brand names, said Steven Reinemund, PepsiCo's president 
and chief operating officer. One idea: Life cereal or Cap'n Crunch in a "snack format." Mr. Reinemund also said 
Frito-Lay would be able to pick up new expertise from Quaker on making grain-based snacks. 
Cold cereal is Quaker's biggest business after Gatorade, with more than $700 million in revenue. But the 
cold-cereal business has been weak in recent years, as more consumers eat on the run. 
But oatmeal, which makes up about 10% of Quaker's revenue, according to analysts, has become one of 
Quaker's best moneymakers. The company has done a good job promoting oatmeal as a cholesterol fighter, and 
it has introduced flavors such as French vanilla that have become popular with adults. The company's kid-friendly

oatmeal -- with egg-shaped sugar puffs that turn into tiny dinosaurs when mixed with hot water -- also has been a 
surprise hit. At the same time, Quaker enjoys huge profit margins and a dominant market share. 
Other products such as Rice-A-Roni and Aunt Jemima syrup dominate their markets but have shown little growth. 
Still, even if Quaker's portfolio includes a lot of less-than-sexy categories, analysts say the company has one of 
the better management teams in the industry. PepsiCo said Quaker management will be kept in place. 
Mr. Enrico said Quaker's nonsnack foods will make up 10% of PepsiCo's sales and 11% of its operating profit. 
Pepsi's biggest focus, of course, will be on Gatorade. Noncarbonated beverages are growing three times as fast 
as carbonated beverages, and much of that growth comes from young consumers. Increasingly, children are 
learning to drink Gatorade at an early age -- at soccer practices, for example -- and they are learning to associate 
it with healthy behavior. 
Mr. Enrico said owning Gatorade would enhance PepsiCo's clout in the supermarket aisle containing "shelf 
stable" juices. He said because Gatorade and shelf-stable juices produced by PepsiCo's Tropicana unit, such as 
the Twister line, are distributed similarly, the units' sales forces would work together. "This gives us a fourth aisle 
of the supermarket, with enough scale to be the preferred partner to the retailer," he said. 
While Gatorade is distributed through a warehouse system to supermarkets, Pepsi will be able to boost volume 
by increasing the drink's presence in smaller, neighborhood stores and in vending machines through its own 
bottler network. William Pecoriello, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said in a research note that Pepsi 
can boost Gatorade's volume by 10% by putting it into Pepsi's bottler network. 
Several analysts said the acquisition of Quaker, and with it, Gatorade, represents an opportunity for Pepsi's 
largest bottler, Pepsi Bottling Group Inc., because of the volume lift it will gain "without having to pay anything for 
this upside," UBS Warburg analyst Caroline Levy wrote. 
Pepsi's opportunities to expand Quaker's business overseas are more limited than those Coca-Cola Co. would 
have had if it had acquired Quaker. But Mr. Enrico said he sees opportunities for Gatorade and Quaker foods to 
be sold in international markets. Quaker recently began selling Gatorade in Latin America, but there are many 
more warm-weather climates that remain untouched. The brand is sold in 53 international markets, but its 
presence isn't strong.

PepsiCo to Buy Quaker for $13.4 Billion 
PepsiCo to Buy Quaker for $13.4 Billion

PepsiCo Inc., ending a closely watched takeover saga during which rival Coca-Cola Co. nearly walked away with 
the prize, sealed a deal to acquire Quaker Oats Co. for $13.4 billion in stock and set in motion a series of 
management changes related to the deal. 
Both companies' boards have approved the transaction, and an announcement is expected this morning. 
In an interview yesterday, Roger Enrico, PepsiCo's chairman and chief executive, said he is accelerating his 
previously disclosed succession plan by handing over both titles to President Steven Reinemund as soon as the 
deal with Quaker closes, expected in the spring. A few months ago, Mr. Enrico announced he would retire as 
CEO at the end of next year and step aside as chairman at the end of 2002. Instead, he will stay on PepsiCo's 
board and hold the title of vice chairman. 
In an effort to make sure Quaker is smoothly integrated into PepsiCo, Mr. Enrico has persuaded Robert Morrison, 
who as Quaker's chairman and CEO engineered a major turnaround of that company, to remain with the 
combined company as a vice chairman with continued responsibility for the Quaker businesses. Mr. Morrison and 
Mr. Enrico both will report to Mr. Reinemund. At the same time, Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's well-regarded chief 
financial officer and a close ally of Mr. Reinemund, will add the title of president, firmly placing her as PepsiCo's 
No. 2. Both Ms. Nooyi and Mr. Morrison will join PepsiCo's board. 
With Mr. Morrison scheduled to step down as Quaker's chairman and CEO once the deal closes, Mr. Enrico said 
he thought he should step down simultaneously as "a parallel situation." That way, there would be a clear chain of 
command to Mr. Reinemund rather than a "long line with a pecking order," Mr. Enrico said. 
Mr. Morrison, who has committed to staying for about 18 months after the deal closes, said he and his 
management team have of "great deal of pride" in what they have accomplished at Quaker, and wanted to see 
the business successfully merged into PepsiCo. In late 1997, when Mr. Morrison took over as Quaker CEO, the 
company was considered an also-ran, limping along after its botched acquisition of Snapple. He is credited with 
restoring consistent earnings growth by shedding small food businesses and focusing on the beverage business, 
proving to skeptics that Quaker could thrive as an independent entity. 
Mr. Morrison said the presence of Mr. Enrico and himself as vice chairmen, combined with Mr. Reinemund and 
Ms. Nooyi, would make for a "wonderful foursome" overseeing the combined entity. In an interview, Mr. 
Reinemund said he was trying to "create a collaborative" management style. "Strict hierarchical organizations are 
dinosaurs for growth companies," Mr. Reinemund said. 
Under the terms of the deal, PepsiCo, as expected, will offer 2.3 of its shares for each share of Quaker, which 
would value Quaker at $97.46 a share based on PepsiCo's share price of $42.38 each at 4 p.m. in New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading, down $3, or 6.6%. Quaker rose $1.69 to $88.63 a share in Big Board trading. 
PepsiCo also is expected to assume about $761 million of debt. 
The exchange ratio is the same as PepsiCo, of Purchase, N.Y., offered one month ago, when discussions fell 
apart because of price disagreements. Quaker, of Chicago, had wanted a "collar" that would have adjusted the 
ratio for fluctuations in PepsiCo's stock price, and PepsiCo was unwilling to offer that protection. Under the 
agreement that was struck, the two sides have agreed to some price safeguards. Should PepsiCo stock fall to 
less than $40 a share -- which would translate to $92 a Quaker share -- for 10 random days during the month 
prior to closing, Quaker can walk away, unless PepsiCo chooses to offer at least $92 a share. Similarly,

Page 84 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
PepsiCo's bid is capped at $105 a Quaker share, so if PepsiCo stock rises to more than $45.65 a share, Quaker 
shareholders would get just $105 a share. 
The combined company will be 83%-owned by PepsiCo shareholders and 17% by Quaker shareholders. Should 
Quaker terminate the deal or be sold to another company, PepsiCo would receive a $420 million breakup fee. 
The deal puts the valuable Gatorade brand in the PepsiCo portfolio and substantially boosts PepsiCo's presence 
in the business of selling noncarbonated beverages, a segment that is dwarfed in size by fizzy drinks but is 
growing three times as fast. Mr. Enrico said he estimates PepsiCo, with brands such as Aquafina water and SoBe 
drinks, will have a 25% share of the noncarbonated segment, 11/2 times as large as Coca-Cola's portion. 
Owning so many strong brands should increase Pepsi's clout among retailers, giving the company a greater 
advantage in the fight among beverage companies for precious space in convenience-store coolers. "When the 
PepsiCo guy walks into 7-Eleven, they're going to have to pay a lot more attention to him than they do to Coke," 
one Pepsi bottler said. "He'll have Pepsi, Gatorade, SoBe, and Tropicana. He owns the refrigerator door." 
The transaction is subject to regulatory approval, and some analysts have questioned whether PepsiCo will 
encounter problems because it owns All-Sport, the No. 3 brand, with a 3% share, compared with 83% for 
Gatorade and 12% for Coca-Cola's Powerade. PepsiCo has agreed to dispose of All-Sport if regulators insist it do 
so. 
The deal ends a strange takeover tale that PepsiCo put in motion more than a month ago, when Mr. Enrico and 
Mr. Reinemund visited Quaker's Mr. Morrison in Chicago and suggested it was time the companies got together. 
The two companies held discussions and discussed a price but couldn't strike a deal. Once news of the 
discussions surfaced, Quaker was quickly approached by Coca-Cola and France's Danone SA. Coca-Cola came 
to the brink of a deal with Quaker nearly two weeks ago, offering $15.75 billion, or $115 a share in stock. At the 
last minute, however, Coca-Cola's board, which includes investor Warren Buffett, scotched the plans, dealing a 
blow to Coca-Cola CEO Doug Daft. Two days later, Danone pulled out. 
About a week ago, Mr. Morrison and Mr. Enrico revived their earlier discussions and came to agreement fairly 
quickly. Mr. Enrico says Mr. Morrison never sought a management role, but that Mr. Enrico and Mr. Reinemund 
believed one of Quaker's greatest assets was its executives, and PepsiCo wanted to do everything possible to 
keep its top talent. 
Mr. Enrico said he believes the Quaker deal, which will be accounted for as a pooling of interests, will accelerate 
PepsiCo's top line and bottom line, increasing the company's earnings-per-share growth rate to 13% to 14%, up 
from 12% to 13%. He and Mr. Reinemund said they have been conservative in estimating synergies and 
projected growth rates for Gatorade that are slower than its historic performance. 
Analysts mostly have focused on the lift to Gatorade's sales by placing the sports drink in Pepsi's vast distribution 
network of vending machines. Mr. Enrico says he sees solid opportunity in this area, as well as in boosting 
international sales, but to be conservative, PepsiCo hasn't included those gains in its models to meet its projected 
numbers. 
Mr. Enrico said Wall Street hasn't focused on one of the bigger advantages of the Quaker deal -- Gatorade's fit 
with Tropicana "shelf stable" drinks. These drinks, such as Tropicana Twister, are sold in the same supermarket 
aisles as Gatorade. Owning Gatorade and Tropicana will give PepsiCo far more clout with retailers -- and could 
sharply boost sales of Tropicana's shelf-stable drinks. He also said Quaker's food business has brands that are 
leaders in their categories and highly profitable. 
So far, most analysts have been optimistic about a PepsiCo-Quaker union even though PepsiCo stock has been 
hit on news of a potential deal. "This is a strategically desirable move," Caroline Levy, an analyst at UBS 
Warburg, wrote in a research note Friday. "We believe PepsiCo sees more volume and savings opportunities 
than the market currently understands." Others are more concerned. Michael Branca, an analyst at Lehman 
Brothers, wrote Friday that he was concerned about Quaker's food business's slowing PepsiCo's growth rate and 
worried if Gatorade's phenomenal track record is sustainable. 
PepsiCo was advised by Merrill Lynch & Co. and the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell. Quaker's investment 
bankers were Goldman, Sachs Group Inc. and J.P. Morgan & Co., and its legal counsel was Cadwalader, 
Wickersham & Taft.

There is no question that PepsiCo Inc. wanted Quaker Oats Co. for its powerhouse Gatorade sports drink. But 
PepsiCo is also looking forward to munching on Quaker's snack foods. 
Quaker's food business, which makes up about 60 per cent of its revenue, is highly profitable, and some of its 
products can enhance PepsiCo's goal of becoming the top seller of convenience foods and beverages, PepsiCo 
executives say. 
With its $13.4-billion (U.S.) purchase of Quaker, the Purchase, N.Y., snack-food and beverage company 
anticipates a bright future in Quaker's small-but-growing business in chewy granola and other bars, as well as its 
rice cakes. PepsiCo already has been working on expanding its Frito-Lay division, which made up 62 per cent of 
the company's sales last year, beyond the salty and other snack markets it dominates, into light meals and 
nutritious snacks.

Pepsi closes Quaker deal. 
Pepsi closes Quaker deal.

PepsiCo and Quaker Oats confirmed on Monday that PepsiCo will acquire Quaker at a cost of 2.3 of its shares 
for each Quaker share. 
The deal will require the issuance of some 315m new PepsiCo shares. 
The bid values Quaker, the cereals and soft drinks maker, at more than $13bn and creates a company with a 
market capitalisation of more than $80bn and pro forma revenues of $25bn. 
The deal is not subject to a 'collar', locking in a price range, but PepsiCo's offer is subject to a maximum value of 
$105 per Quaker share while Quaker can walk out of the deal, without penalty, if the value falls below $92 a 
share. 
The boards of both groups met at the weekend to agree the offer, according to people close to the talks. 
At Friday's closing price of $42.38 per Pepsi share, the terms are worth $97.47 per Quaker share, 10 per cent 
above Quaker's closing price of $88.62 at the end of the week. 
The cap would allow the soft drinks and snacks group to offer a lower number of its shares per Quaker share 
should a rise in the Pepsi stock price take the value of its bid above $105. 
Pepsi will also assume about $500m of Quaker's debt. Quaker's board rejected an earlier offer from Pepsi last 
month, which also centred around an offer of 2.3 Pepsi shares, partly because of the absence of a walk-away 
clause which would have protected Quaker shareholders from a fall in the Pepsi stock price. 
The acquisition may face regulatory scrutiny, as Pepsi owns the smaller All-Sport drink, but if completed, the deal 
would resolve a turbulent month for Quaker, with Coca-Cola and Danone also showing interest in buying the 
group. 
Bob Morrison, Quaker chairman, and Roger Enrico, PepsiCo chairman and CEO, will be vice-chairmen of the 
new company, to retain the PepsiCo name, while Steve Reinemund will become chairman and CEO. PepsiCo's 
financial officer, Indra Nooyi, will become president and retain her CFO responsibilities. 
Pepsi's principal interest in Quaker is thought to focus on the fast-growing Gatorade brand, which has annual 
sales of about $1.8bn, but accounting rules governing "pooling of interest" transactions will prevent it from making 
large disposals from Quaker's portfolio of food assets, which include hot oat cereal and cold cereal brands such 
as Cap'n Crunch. 
Analysts say the acquisition of Quaker will strengthen Pepsi's position in non-carbonated soft drinks in 
comparison with Coke. 
Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase advised Quaker, and Pepsi was advised by Merrill Lynch. 
In early trading in New York, PepsiCo shares were up 4.1% at $44.13 and Quaker shares were up 2.7% at $91.

As Bob Morrison, chief executive of Quaker Oats, shook hands with PepsiCo's Roger Enrico for the cameras on 
Monday, he must have thought back to the moment almost two weeks ago when he adopted a strikingly similar 
pose with Enrico's arch-rival, Doug Daft of Coca-Cola. 
On that fateful night at the St Regis hotel in New York, Morrison was so sure that he had sewn up a takeover of 
Quaker by Coke that the two men had publicity photos taken before Coke officials started their board meeting. 
Unfortunately for both men, the meeting turned out to be more than the usual formality, as other Coke directors, 
led by Warren Buffett, unceremoniously voted down what would have been the Atlanta titan's largest deal. 
This might have left Daft vulnerable but the spin from Atlanta has been that this is no setback at all for the affable 
Australian, who cut his teeth in the consensus-centric business culture of Asia. Few people elsewhere in the 
drinks business or on Wall Street see the outcome positively, so the jokes have been predictably unkind. 
After the boards of PepsiCo and Quaker met to approve their deal this weekend, one person close to Quaker 
noted: "We got it right this time; we let their board go first." 
As clever souls in the Quaker camp have taken to saying: "You don't want to get Dafted."

Pepsi closes Quaker deal. 
Pepsi closes Quaker deal.

PepsiCo and Quaker Oats confirmed on Monday that PepsiCo will acquire Quaker at a cost of 2.3 of its shares 
for each Quaker share. 
The deal will require the issuance of some 315m new PepsiCo shares. 
The bid values Quaker, the cereals and soft drinks maker, over $13bn and creates a company with a market 
capitalisation of over $80bn and pro forma revenues of $25bn. 
The deal is not subject to a 'collar', locking in a price range, but PepsiCo's offer is subject to a maximum value of 
$105 per Quaker share while Quaker can walk out of the deal, without penalty, if the value falls below $92 a 
share. 
The boards of both groups met at the weekend to agree the offer, according to people close to the talks. 
At Friday's closing price of $42.38 per Pepsi share, the terms are worth $97.47 per Quaker share, 10 per cent 
above Quaker's closing price of $88.62 at the end of the week. 
The cap would allow the soft drinks and snacks group to offer a lower number of its shares per Quaker share 
should a rise in the Pepsi stock price take the value of its bid above $105. 
Pepsi will also assume about $500m of Quaker's debt. Quaker's board rejected an earlier offer from Pepsi last 
month, which also centred around an offer of 2.3 Pepsi shares, partly because of the absence of a walk-away 
clause which would have protected Quaker shareholders from a fall in the Pepsi stock price. 
The acquisition may face regulatory scrutiny, as Pepsi owns the smaller All-Sport drink, but if completed, the deal 
would resolve a turbulent month for Quaker, with Coca-Cola and Danone also showing interest in buying the 
group. 
Bob Morrison, Quaker chairman, and Roger Enrico, PepsiCo chairman and CEO, will be vice-chairmen of the 
new company, to retain the PepsiCo name, while Steve Reinemund will become chairman and CEO. PepsiCo's 
financial officer, Indra Nooyi, will become president and retain her CFO responsibilities. 
Pepsi's principal interest in Quaker is thought to focus on the fast-growing Gatorade brand, which has annual 
sales of about $1.8bn, but accounting rules governing "pooling of interest" transactions will prevent it from making 
large disposals from Quaker's portfolio of food assets, which include hot oat cereal and cold cereal brands such 
as Cap'n Crunch. 
Analysts say the acquisition of Quaker will strengthen Pepsi's position in non-carbonated soft drinks in 
comparison with Coke. 
Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase advised Quaker, and Pepsi was advised by Merrill Lynch.

PURCHASE, N.Y. -(Dow Jones)- PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) confirmed it reached an agreement to acquire Quaker Oats 
Co. (OAT) in a tax-free transaction exchanging 2.3 shares for each Quaker share, up to a maximum value of 
$105 per Quaker share. 
In a press release Monday, PepsiCo said the deal doesn't include a guaranteed price protection or "collar," but if 
the value to Quaker shareholders falls below $92 a share, Quaker may exit the agreement without penalty. 
Based on Friday's closing stock prices, PepsiCo's offer values each Quaker share at $97.47, a 9.98% premium 
over the closing price of $88.63. PepsiCo shares closed Friday at $42.38. 
Earlier, The Wall Street Journal reported that the PepsiCo offer is worth $13.4 billion in stock, and that PepsiCo is 
also expected to assume about $761 million of debt. 
PepsiCo offered the same exchange ratio to Quaker a month ago, when talks fell apart over price disagreements. 
PepsiCo said it expects the addition of Quaker to be accretive to earnings in the first full year and thereafter. 
The transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests and is expected to close in the first half of 2001, 
subject to approval by PepsiCo and Quaker shareholders, expiration of the antitrust waiting period and other 
customary approvals. 
A First Call/Thomson Financial survey of four analysts produced a mean earnings estimate of $1.86 a diluted 
share for 2002, which would be the first full year after the merger if the projected closing date is met. 
For the full year 1999, PepsiCo reported net income of $2.05 billion, or $1.37 a diluted share, on revenue of $18.2 
billion. Quaker's 1999 net income was $455.0 million, or $3.23 a share, on revenue of $4.7 billion. 
PepsiCo will issue about 315 million new shares to Quaker shareholders. Currently the company has about 1.4 
billion shares outstanding. 
The company formed by the merger of PepsiCo and Quaker would have pro forma revenue of $25 billion, 
PepsiCo said, also projecting the market capitalization for the combined company at more than $80 billion. 
The acquisition of Quaker will enhance PepsiCo's ongoing sales and profit growth rates, in addition to 
immediately improving PepsiCo's return on invested capital by 200 basis points. 
PepsiCo said Quaker's Gatorade brand would make the company the leader in non-carbonated beverages as 
well as boosting the scale available to its Tropicana juice unit. 
Quaker's snack business, which includes granola bars and rice snacks, complements PepsiCo's Frito-Lay unit, 
and PepsiCo expects Quaker's non-snack food business to continue to provide "steady profit growth and 
substantial free cash flow." 
PepsiCo said its board accepted several management changes proposed for when the acquisition of Quaker 
closes. 
Current PepsiCo President Steven Reinemund will become chairman and chief executive of the new company, 
while PepsiCo's chief financial officer, Indra Nooyi, will become president, while retaining chief financial duties. 
Roger Enrico, the current chairman and chief executive of PepsiCo, and Robert Morrison, Quaker's chairman 
and chief executive, will both stay on at the new company as vice chairman.

Morrison, who will be nominated for election to the board, will continue to serve as chairman, president and chief 
executive of Quaker when it becomes a unit of PepsiCo. 
The Wall Street Journal reported that Morrison has committed to staying for about 18 months after the deal 
closes. 
Nooyi will also be nominated to the board, PepsiCo said, though a representative wasn't immediately available to 
provide the final size of the board. 
After initial acquisition discussions with PepsiCo fell apart a month ago, Quaker was approached by both 
Coca-Cola Co. (KO), which offered $15.75 billion in stock, and France's Danone S.A. (DA). Both offers were later 
withdrawn. 
As reported earlier, The Wall Street Journal said that should Quaker terminate the deal or be sold to another 
company, PepsiCo would receive a $420 million breakup fee. A PepsiCo representative wasn't immediately 
avaialable to confirm this.

PepsiCo Adds Gatorade to Its Stable with $13.4 Billion Purchase of Quaker Oats 
PepsiCo Adds Gatorade to Its Stable with $13.4 Billion Purchase of Quaker Oats

PURCHASE, N.Y. -(Dow Jones)- PepsiCo Inc. agreed to acquire Quaker Oats Co., one of the most prized assets 
in the food and beverage industry, in a stock swap valued at $13.4 billion. 
By winning Quaker, Pepsico, of Purchase, N.Y., gets the powerhouse Gatorade brand, which has long been the 
envy of soft-drink giants for its strong growth rate. 
Indeed, PepsiCo (PEP) said Monday that the Gatorade brand will make PepsiCo the leader in noncarbonated 
beverages. 
The companies said Quaker's snack business, which includes granola bars and rice snacks, complements 
PepsiCo's Frito-Lay unit, and PepsiCo expects Quaker's nonsnack food business to continue to provide "steady 
profit growth and substantial free cash flow." 
Conservatively, Pepsico said, the acquisition will boost sales and earnings-growth rates by at least 1% a year. 
Less than two weeks ago, rival Cocal-Cola Co. (KO) came close to a deal to acquire Quaker, Chicago, for $15.75 
billion in stock, but backed out amid board opposition. Quaker was also approached by France's Danone SA, 
which withdrew its offer two days later after its stock was hammered by the news. 
"Combining with the world-renowned PepsiCo organization will unleash the tremendous global growth potential of 
the Gatorade brand and leverage the strengths of our foods business," Quaker Chairman Robert S. Morrison said 
in a written statement Monday. 
Roger Enrico, PepsiCo's chairman and chief executive, is accelerating his previously disclosed succession plan 
by handing over both titles to President Steven Reinemund when the deal with Quaker closes, expected in the 
spring. 
Mr. Morrison, who engineered a major turnaround of Quaker Oats, will remain with the combined company as a 
vice chairman with continued responsibility for the Quaker businesses. 
PepsiCo's chief financial officer, Indra Nooyi, will become president, while retaining her CFO responsibilities. 
Under the terms of the deal, each Quaker (OAT) share will be exchanged for 2.3 Pepsico shares, up to a 
maximum value of $105 per Quaker share. 
PepsiCo will issue about 315 million new shares to Quaker shareholders. The company has about 1.4 billion 
shares outstanding. 
Based on Pepsico's share price of $42.38 at 4 p.m. EST in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, 
each of Quaker's roughly 131.08 million outstanding shares would be valued at $97.47, a 10% premium to their 
Friday price of $88.63. Pepsico will also assume about $761 million of debt. 
The ratio is the same as Pepsi had offered a month ago, when discussions fell apart after the two sides failed to 
reach an agreement over price. 
Quaker had wanted a "collar," that would have adjusted the exchange ratio for fluctuations in PepsiCo's stock 
price, and PepsiCo was unwilling to offer that protection, The Wall Street Journal said Monday. 
The latest agreement doesn't include a collar, but it allows Quaker to exit the agreement without penalty if the 
value to Quaker shareholders falls below $92 a share. Pepsico's offer is capped at $105 a Quaker share.

Page 95 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The deal is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies as well as regulatory clearance and other 
customary conditions. Some analysts have speculated that Pepsico may face antitrust scrutiny because of its 
ownership of All-Sport, although All-Sport's 3% market share is dwarfed by Gatorade's 83% share. PepsiCo has 
agreed to dispose of All-Sport if regulators require it to do so, the Journal said. 
The companies said the transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests. 
PepsiCo said the combined company will have pro forma revenue of $25 billion, and market capitalization of more 
than $80 billion. Pepsico expects the combination to add between a penny and two cents to per-share earnings in 
the first full year. Analysts are looking for per-share earnings of $1.45 for 2000 and $1.64 for 2001, according to 
First Call/Thomson Financial. 
In a conference call with investors Monday, Mr. Enrico said the combined company should be able to grow 
per-share earnings 13% to 14%, with top-line sales growing at a consistent 7% rate and operating earnings 
growing 11% to 12%, assuming "modest synergies." 
Without Quaker, Pepsi had put annual per-share growth in the range of 12% to 13%. Sales were seen rising 6% 
to 7% a year and operating earnings growth was projected at 10% to 11%. 
The big revenue kicker is expected to be Gatorade. Mr. Enrico said the sports beverage could boost revenue 9% 
or better annually and deliver 13.5% in profit growth - without benefits from subsequent synergies. 
Besides enlarging Pepsi's footprint in the noncarbonated beverage aisle, acquiring Quaker will significantly 
enhance its already mammoth Frito-Lay snack-foods business, Mr. Enrico said. 
"The combination gives us a terrific second brand in Quaker itself, and a great business in snacks - rice cakes 
and granola bars," he said. Those products cater to a changing consumer lifestyle where people increasingly eat 
"one-handed meals," Mr. Enrico said. 
Pointing to the growth potential in food bars, he said, "We see this market migrating into a ... legitimate way for 
people to get part of their nutrition." 
Also, while Quaker's nonsnack food business - primarily breakfast cereals - "is a good business," PepsiCo said, it 
won't become a fourth core category, alongside carbonated, noncarbonated and salty snacks. Still, the company 
indicated it doesn't intend to sell the nonsnack food business. 
Separately, Quaker Oats said it will discontinue its $1 billion share-buyback program. As of Sept. 30, Quaker 
said, the company has repurchased $867 million of common stock. The program began in March 1998. 
And PepsiCo rescinded a $4 billion common stock-buyback plan approved on Nov. 21. The company had 
expected to implement the plan over the next three years. Pepsico also canceled the remainder of a $3 billion 
share-repurchase program under which it has bought $2.8 billion in shares to date.

PepsiCo: Quaker Holders Would Represent 17% of Ownership 
PepsiCo: Quaker Holders Would Represent 17% of Ownership

DES MOINES, Iowa -(Dow Jones)- PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) said its acquisition of Quaker Oats Co. (OAT) will 
"conservatively" boost the combined company's sales and earnings growth rates by at least 1% a year. 
It also will increase Pepsi's dominance in the salted snack food business and make it the "category captain" in 
non-carbonated beverages, the company told investors on a conference call Monday morning. 
The combination is expected to add between 1-2 cents to per-share earnings in the first full year, Pepsi said. The 
First Call/Thomson Financial consensus for PepsiCo in 2001 has been $1.64 per diluted share. This year's 
consensus is $1.45. 
Calling the deal "one terrific moment" in the company's history, PepsiCo's outgoing chairman and chief executive 
Roger Enrico said the addition of Quaker's Gatorade sports drink would give Pepsi a commanding 25% share of 
the U.S. non-carbonated beverage business. That would be one and a half times larger than the next player in a 
category that is growing three times as fast as the U.S. carbonated-beverages business. 
Pepsi's Tropicana juice line will be the "big story" in synergies from the anticipated $13.3 billion deal, Enrico said. 
Combining Gatorade's marketing and distribution infrastructure with that of Tropicana's portfolio will make the 
company the "category captain" of major supermarket non-refrigerated juice aisle, he said. 
PepsiCo's CEO Enrico ticked off a series of compelling numbers in what he stressed was a "conservative" model 
that brought the two sides back together after Quaker initially balked and went looking for another suitor. 
He said the combined company now should be able to grow per-share earnings 13-14%, with top-line sales in a 
consistent 7% growth rate and operating earnings growing 11-12%, assuming "modest synergies." 
Without Quaker, Pepsi had put annual per-share growth in the 12-13% range. Previously, sales were seen as 
rising 6-7% a year and operating earnings growing in the 10-11% range. 
The big revenue kicker is expected to be Gatorade, which Enrico said could increase revenue at 9% or better 
annually and deliver 13.5% in profit growth - without benefits from subsequent synergies. 
"The headline here is that the combination will solidify our growth prospects, and enhance them going forward," 
Enrico said. "With discipline in capital expenditures and cash management, we would expect return on invested 
capital to growth 50 to 100 basis points per year," he said. 
Besides enlarging Pepsi's footprint in the non-carbonated beverage aisle, acquiring Quaker will significantly 
enhance its already mammoth Frito-Lay snack-foods business, Enrico said, noting that few analyses of the deal 
so far had focused on that part of the opportunities the acquisition delivers. 
"The combination gives us a terrific second brand in Quaker itself, and a great business in snacks - rice cakes 
and granola bars," he said. Those products cater to a changing consumer lifestyle where people increasingly eat 
"one-handed meals," Enrico said. 
Pointing to the growth potential in food bars, he said, "We see this market migrating into a ... legitimate way for 
people to get part of their nutrition. ... We see bars as an ideal way to 'smuggle nutrition' into more daily diets." 
He noted that Pepsi isn't now in the snack bar business, but that Quaker gives it "legitimacy overnight."

Page 99 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
While "net net" Quaker's snacks may be only 8% of that company's portfolio, it "adds a much higher share of 
excitement to us at PepsiCo," he said. 
The company also said that while Quaker's non-snack food business - primarily breakfast cereals - "is a good 
business," it won't become a fourth core category for PepsiCo, alongside carbonated, noncarbonated and salty 
snacks. 
But the company indicated it has no intention of shopping Quaker's non-snack food businesses. 
PepsiCo projects cost-saving synergies of at least $230 million. About $50 million of that would come in combined 
procurement. Another $45 million would be in improved sales of Tropicana's "ambient" or non-refrigerated 
business, and another $34 million in improved snack sales opportunities for Quaker products moving through the 
Frito-Lay distribution system, officials said. 
They added that anticipated free cash flow from the combined company could increase to as much as 20 cents 
per share over the next five years. 
The deal has a share price collar that allows Quaker to back out if Pepsi stock falls below $40 a share and Pepsi 
doesn't "top off" that value. The transaction has a cap of $105 per Quaker share. 
Asked on the conference call about the back-away provisions, Quaker chairman Robert Morrison said he would 
be "flabbergasted" if Pepsi fell below $40. 
Shares of Pepsi were trading midday Monday at $43.88 up $1.50. Those of Quaker were trading at $91.06, up 
$2.44. 
Should Quaker end up in another company's hands, Pepsi would receive a $420 million breakup fee. Pepsi 
management said they estimate merger and related restructuring costs at about $400 million. 
Assuming the transaction is consummated as planned, Quaker shareholders would comprise about 17% of the 
combined company's ownership. 
Of the deal, incoming Chairman and CEO Steve Reinemund commented that 
much needs be done to accomplish what is envisioned in Pepsi's biggest 
deal ever. "Great ideas," he said, "degenerate into work."

Crunch talks are taking place in Chicago today as the board of cereal company Quaker Oats meets to decide 
whether to accept the latest takeover approach from PepsiCo. 
The drinks giant has restated its original offer of 2.3 shares for each piece of Quaker's paper, a proposal that 
values the company at around $14bn based on Pepsi's closing price of $42.38 on Friday. The Pepsi board, 
meeting in upstate New York this weekend, is also weighing whether let Quaker leave the table during 
negotiations if the offer price dips below an agreed level, thought to be between $85 and $90 per share. 
"This time the Quaker board has a little more comfort," said one source. "Before, their problem was there was no 
proper auction and no tension. It was difficult to hear from other bidders at the same time and figure out what 
would be best." 
Pepsi's initial approach was rebuffed last month by Quaker directors who believed alternative offers might 
emerge. Days later, Coca-Col'as chief executive, Doug Daft, expressed interest, but then back-tracked when the 
board decided a deal would dilute the company's value. Shortly afterwards, Danone was also forced to back away 
when its own flirtation with Quaker sent the French firm's shares into free-fall. 
All three suitors have been keen to acquire Gatorade, the energy drink that is the outstanding asset in a portfolio 
that also includes Sugar Puffs, Cap'n Crunch and the oat cereal from which the company takes its name. 
Gatorade has an 86% share of the US sports drink market, double-digit revenue growth and, some suggest, a 
huge potential market in Europe. 
Gatorade is an unfamiliar brand in the UK, but in the US it is famous as the energy drink of sporting superstars. 
The formula, invented by researchers at Florida University in the 1960s, was designed to replace the fluids and 
minerals lost by American footballers. The drink caught the public imagination when the university football team, 
the Gators, used it to stunning effect in the second half of the 1967 Orange Bowl competition, thrashing their 
rivals Georgia Tech. 
Whether Gatorade can power Pepsi to a similar victory over rival Coke is the question on which the outcome of 
this weekend's discussions is likely to turn. Chief executive Roger Enrico believes the drink's potential in Europe 
and Asia will outweigh the relatively flat demand for Gatorade in the domestic market and will help Pepsi 
consolidate an already strong position in the non-Cola market. 
But it is thought that several of Pepsi's institutional shareholders, including US insurance giant Fidelity, are 
unhappy with the proposed deal. Paying what is regarded as full price for a portfolio of brands that includes a 
number of pedestrian food labels is proving tough to sell to investors because, while some products could be 
folded into Pepsi's Frito-Lay business, the remainder would need to be sold. 
"If Coke could think of a way not to get into the food business, then they might come back too," says John 
McMillin, a consumer goods analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. 
There are also concerns over the true level of synergy between the Pepsi and Gatorade distribution systems. 
While Quaker uses a warehouse system, PepsiCo uses a network of bottling companies to deliver its 
products."This is a fundamental difference that adds an extra level of complexity for Pepsi. Nestle and Danone, 
which both use warehouse systems to deliver their water, would be better equipped to get Gatorade to the 
market," says an observer. 
Nestle, the Swiss owner of Perrier and a clutch of breakfast cereal brands, has still not ruled out entering the 
race. A deal would boost Nestle's expansion plans in the consolidating food sector, but it could also interfere with 
its alliance with the US company General Mills under which both have agreed to not to interfere in one another's 
cereal markets. Cadbury-Schweppes, which has been building a position in the fruit drinks market with 
acquisitions of Snapple and, potentially, Orangina, is unlikely to bid at the prevailing price.

"Nestle is the wild card that is watching the situation closely," says Patrick Schumann, at Edward Jones. "But it 
looks increasingly likely that the negotiations that started with Pepsi will also end with Pepsi."More than 30 years 
ago, the post-match analysis after the Gator's Orange Bowl victory has passed into marketing history. "We didn't 
have Gatorade. That made the difference," the losing coach told reporters. The same might be said of Gatorade's 
suitors today.

LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc chief Roger Enrico is looking to buy firms in developed markets such 
as Germany, Japan and Scandinavia to bolster the group's salty snacks business outside the United States, the 
Financial Times reported on Thursday. In an interview with the FT on its web site, Enrico was also quoted as 
saying he was interested in expanding PepsiCo into sweeter products, such as pastries. 
He said acquisitions were the preferred way for PepsiCo, a world leader in salty snacks through its Frito-Lay unit, 
to compete effectively in large, mature markets. 
"In some markets around the world where there's a strong competitor, it looks to us that greenfielding into those 
countries will be problematic. We're not guaranteed to succeed," he said. "We'd much rather acquire into those 
markets." 
The FT said Enrico declined to comment on PepsiCo's interest in the U.S. food and drinks group Quaker Oats 
Co. . 
The newspaper said he would only say: "We don't need a major acquisition to achieve any of the objectives we've 
laid out. But if we get something and we can do it in a financially disciplined way...so that it doesn't hurt our return 
on investment, dilute our earnings per share and it strengthens our other lines of business, why wouldn't we take 
a look at it?" 
PepsiCo is reported to have held talks this month to buy Quaker for about $13.7 billion in stocks, but the talks 
failed to result in a deal.

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES &MARKETS - PepsiCo back in Quaker takeover talks - Soft drinks group in 
discussions over $13bn deal for breakfast cereal maker. 
PepsiCo, the soft drinks group, is back in talks with Quaker Oats about a takeover which could value the sports 
drinks and breakfast cereal maker at more than $13bn. 
According to people close to the negotiations, the discussions have been renewed around the original all-stock 
offer submitted by Pepsi a month ago, which Quaker rejected. 
Pepsi's original offer was for 2.3 shares for each of Quaker's shares. Based on last night's closing price of 
$45.38, the bid would value each Quaker share at around $104, or the entire company at almost $14bn. Last 
night, Quaker shares closed at $86.94. 
However, the terms of the deal are thought to be still under discussion. 
Pepsi is also understood to be considering introducing a condition which would allow Quaker to walk away from a 
deal should a fall in Pepsi's stock price take the value of its offer below a certain level. This price, which was 
under discussion last night, is expected to fall in the $85-$90 range. 
Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that Pepsi and Quaker will succeed in completing a deal. Last week, 
Quaker's planned deal with Coca-Cola fell apart when the soft drink giant's board vetoed a planned merger. 
Danone, the French dairy products and biscuits group, subsequently walked away after its share price fell heavily 
on news of its interest in Quaker. 
The boards of directors of both companies are expected to meet this weekend to discuss the renewed deal. 
Separately, Roger Enrico, PepsiCo's chief executive, said that he was looking to buy companies in developed 
markets such as Germany, Scandinavia and Japan to bolster the group's salty snacks business outside the US. 
He is also interested in expanding PepsiCo into sweeter products such as pastries. In an interview with the 
Financial Times, Mr Enrico said acquisitions were the preferred way for PepsiCo, a world leader in salty snacks 
through its Frito-Lay division, to compete in mature markets. 
"In some markets around the world where there's a strong competitor, it looks to us that greenfielding into those 
countries will be problematic. We're not guaranteed to succeed," he said. "We'd much rather acquire." 
Though Mr Enrico denied any acquisition talks were pending in Germany, for instance, where Bahlsen and 
Convent Knabbergeback dominate the snack food market, he noted: "In my own view, Convent's a more 
attractive option than Bahlsen." 
Germany is the second-largest European market for salty snacks behind Britain with Bahlsen and Convent, which 
makes Funny Frisch and Chio Chips, each claiming about 20 per cent share, according to Salomon Smith 
Barney.

Speculation has grown that PepsiCo could buy Quaker after its first offer of an estimated $14bn was rejected. 
Since then, Coca-Cola and Danone have both walked away from Quaker. 
But the focus for PepsiCo is building its salty-snacks business, which has grown to eclipse its much better-known 
Pepsi-Cola drinks arm. Frito-Lay, whose brands include Doritos Nacho chips and Lay's potato chips - with about 
48 per cent of the world salty-snacks market - accounts for more than 65 per cent of profits. Though Mr Enrico 
stresses a commitment to beverages, he acknowledges the fastest growth will come from developing snacks in 
markets such as China. 
Though potato chips are still the core product, the company has increasingly turned to different snacks to 
supplement growth. However, he said there is little growth for the cookie business. Additional reporting by Uta

Nikhil Deogun and Betsy McKay 
Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), nearly one month after breaking off talks to acquire Quaker Oats 
Co. (OAT) because of disagreements over price, is once again in advanced discussions to acquire the maker of 
Gatorade and Cap'n Crunch for $14.3 billion in stock, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The two companies appear to be close to agreement on all major points and hope to wrap up a deal in the next 
few days, though last-minute details could always crop up to hinder a deal. Final board meetings are expected 
this weekend. If the two sides reach agreement, a transaction would be announced Monday morning. 
PepsiCo is offering exactly the same offer it put forth last time. Under those terms, Pepsi proposed a 
fixed-exchange offer of 2.3 shares of PepsiCo for each share of Quaker. PepsiCo hasn't offered price protection 
in the form of a "collar" - which is what caused Quaker to reject the last proposal. 
Based on PepsiCo's closing price Thursday of $45.38, the offer values Quaker at $104.36 a share. At 4 p.m. in 
New York Stock Exchange trading, Quaker Oats was at $86.94, down 94 cents. 
PepsiCo, Purchase, N.Y., and Quaker Oats, Chicago, declined comment. 
Analysts have expected Pepsi to come back to Quaker, especially since Quaker seems to have run out of 
suitors, putting Pepsi in a better negotiating position. Coca-Cola Co. (KO) was last week on the verge of acquiring 
Quaker for $115 a share, or $15.75 billion in stock, when Coke's board decided to abandon the potential deal at 
the eleventh hour, an embarrassment for Coke Chairman Doug Daft. Soon after that, France's Danone SA (DA) 
confirmed its interest in Quaker - only to back away 24 hours later after its stock got pummeled on the news. 
The main attraction for all the potential buyers has been Gatorade, Quaker Oats' powerhouse sports drink which 
has successfully fended off assaults from Coke's Powerade brand and Pepsi's All-Sport. The big advantage for 
both PepsiCo and Coca-Cola has been the potential to boost the sales of Gatorade by increasing its availability in 
vending machines. The two soda companies boast enviable distribution systems, having invested aggressively in 
cold drink equipment. 
Gatorade holds a commanding 83.6% of the U.S. "take-home" market for sports drinks, which covers retail stores, 
according to Beverage Digest, an industry publication. Coke's Powerade brand has an 11% share. Pepsi would 
be likely to discontinue its own sports drink brand, All-Sport, in order to win antitrust approval of a deal. Its market 
share for the first half of the year was 3.1%, according to Beverage Digest, an industry publication, and Pepsi 
executives have long considered dropping the brand because of its weak sales. 
Should Pepsi clinch a deal, it will be a blow to Coke since it would give Pepsi a dominant portfolio of 
noncarbonated beverages at a time when these drinks are growing at a much faster than fizzy drinks. For Pepsi, 
the transaction is expected to be accounted for under the favorable pooling of interests method. That means 
Pepsi will, for tax reasons, need to hang on to Quaker Oats' slower-growing food business for two years before 
selling any assets. Of course, PepsiCo owns Frito-Lay, the snack giant, and could use Frito's distribution system 
to sell Quaker's grain-based snacks. 
The sale of Quaker has become something of a takeover saga. The most surprising twist was just when Coke 
seemed all set to announce a deal, it walked away after the board, especially director Warren Buffett, opposed

Page 115 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
the transaction. Coke and Quaker had press releases ready, champagne chilling and conference calls all set, 
when on the night of Nov. 21, after a five-hour Coke board meeting, Coke put out a two-sentence statement 
saying it had decided against pursuing a Quaker deal. 
Pepsi itself had set the ball in motion nearly a month ago by making an offer for Quaker, which was rebuffed by 
the Chicago company after Pepsi refused to guarantee a price to Quaker shareholders. At the time, several 
analysts were surprised that Quaker rejected what appeared to be a compelling offer. 
Many analysts have said a Quaker deal would be a good fit for PepsiCo. Both companies have engineered major 
turnarounds, returning to Wall Street's favor after huge disappointments a few years ago. Quaker hit its nadir in 
1996, dragged down by the botched acquisition of Snapple, which it sold the following year for $300 million, $1.4 
billion less than it had paid in 1994. At about the same time, PepsiCo's restaurant business was hitting weak 
sales and its international operations suffered embarrassing losses. 
Under Roger Enrico, who took over as chief executive in 1996, PepsiCo has worked hard to transform itself from 
a diffuse company into one that is focused on snacks and nonalcoholic beverages. Enrico spun off the fast-food 
restaurant operations, took public its bottling business and acquired Tropicana juices. Indeed, the success of the 
Tropicana deal, initially viewed skeptically because of the high price, may have emboldened PepsiCo to act now 
to buy Quaker. Not only has Tropicana performed well, analysts say it has given Pepsi access to Tropicana's 
research on "functional" beverages, a segment of drinks with supposed health attributes. 
At Quaker, Robert Morrison, CEO since late 1997, has gotten kudos from Wall Street for shedding some small 
food businesses and focusing the company on the beverage business, including extending the Gatorade brand 
with new flavors and brands. The company has introduced a new fitness water, Propel, in select markets. Quaker 
has also leveraged the Gatorade brand by introducing energy bars.

Coke Breaks Off Talks to Acquire Quaker --- Move Is a Blow to Chairman, A Sign of the Board's Active Oversight Role 
Coke Breaks Off Talks to Acquire Quaker --- Move Is a Blow to Chairman, A Sign of the Board's Active 
Oversight Role

Coca-Cola Co.'s board rejected a $15.75 billion stock acquisition of Quaker Oats Co., in a blow to Coke 
Chairman Douglas Daft and a setback to Quaker, the maker of Gatorade and other food products. 
The board's failure to go along with an acquisition of Quaker indicates that Coke's board is taking a strong and 
active role in overseeing the company. It is also a victory for Coke director and investor Warren Buffett, who was 
said to have deep reservations about the all-stock deal. 
The board's decision, communicated in a two-sentence statement late last night, came after a five-hour meeting 
in New York. Even though Coke's management, led by Mr. Daft, brought the potential deal to the directors, the 
directors were said by the company last night to back the executive's leadership. 
"The board of the Coca-Cola Company expressed its enthusiastic support for the current strategic course of the 
company under Doug Daft's leadership as the best means for enhancing shareowner value," the statement said. 
Quaker declined to comment. 
Many on Wall Street had been betting that the deal would be approved, and Coke's stock has suffered as a result. 
Since news of Coke's discussions with Quaker was reported on Sunday by The Wall Street Journal, Coke's 
market capitalization has been slashed by $15.35 billion, about the amount Coke would have paid in stock for the 
deal. 
The failure to agree to a deal comes nearly three weeks after PepsiCo Inc. walked away from a potential bid for 
Quaker. A purchase of Quaker would have given Coke the coveted Gatorade sports drink brand, and kept it 
away from archrival PepsiCo. But any deal would also have faced scrutiny from antitrust officials. 
People close to Coke said last night that Coke executives had grown disillusioned with Quaker after learning that 
Quaker was holding talks with another potential bidder. But they took a possible acquisition to the board anyway. 
It is rare for the CEO of an acquiring company to fail to deliver board approval once the seller has agreed to the 
terms of the buyout proposal. 
Some directors had been expected to support a deal. Others, including Mr. Buffett, were said to be skeptical, 
worrying, among other things, about issuing new Coke shares. Mr. Buffett also is believed to have been 
concerned that the price was high, that the deal was fraught with antitrust and other problems, and that Coke 
should remain focused on restructuring its main beverage business. Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., 
Omaha, Neb., is Coke's biggest shareholder, with 200 million shares, or 8% of the total. 
Coca-Cola is believed to have offered a stock-swap deal valuing Quaker at $115.09 a share, or $15.75 billion, 
according to people familiar with the matter. Coke also was said to have been willing to offer some price 
protection to Quaker shareholders in the form of a 10% collar, which essentially would have guaranteed Quaker 
shareholders $115 a share so long as Coke stock traded within a certain predescribed range of about $56.25 to 
$68.75 a share. 
With Coke stock trading below that range, Coke was believed to have offered an exchange ratio of 2.046 of its 
shares for each share of Quaker, valuing Quaker at slightly more than $113 a share.

Before the board meeting, which took place at the St. Regis hotel, Coke and Quaker believed they were so close 
to a deal that they had mapped out plans for press interviews yesterday and an analysts' conference call today. 
And earlier yesterday, Chairman Daft and Quaker Chairman Robert Morrison had publicity photos taken together. 
The failure of the deal brings to the forefront the prospect of a quick deal with France's Danone SA, which also 
had made a competitive stock-swap offer that would have valued Quaker at slightly more than $110 a share. 
For Danone, owner of Evian bottled water, a deal would be a transforming event since Quaker isn't much smaller 
than Danone. The French company wouldn't face any antitrust hurdles, but may find it difficult to finance a deal 
using its American depositary shares as currency. Investors frequently have punished the stocks of foreign 
acquirers in recent transactions. 
That may leave the door open for PepsiCo, which had offered 2.3 of its shares for each share of Quaker, valuing 
Quaker at $106.95 based on Pepsi's current stock price. The problem with that proposal was the fixed exchange 
ratio: Pepsi wasn't willing to offer any price protection to Quaker shareholders in the event of a decline in Pepsi's 
stock, something both Coke and Danone had been willing to do. 
"The real thing did the right thing," said Andrew Conway, beverage analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 
"Acquiring Quaker for $15 billion to $16 billion would not create near or long-term shareholder value." 
After dropping sharply Monday, Coke's stock fell again yesterday as investors awaited the board's decision. The 
company's shares were down $1.31 to $55.25 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. News 
that any deal is off is expected to boost the shares in trading today. 
The acquisition would have been Coke's largest by far, and would have posed challenges on many fronts. 
Antitrust officials could have taken months to pore over the deal. It also would have been a test of the 
management skills of Mr. Daft. He has been in his job less than a year, and already has his hands full with a 
corporate restructuring that Coke launched at the beginning of this year to restore strong growth. 
Antitrust experts said antitrust scrutiny would have been considerable, since Gatorade commands an 84% share 
of the market for sports drinks, and Coke owns the next-largest sports drink brand, Powerade, which holds an 
11% share. 
Coke probably would have had to sell Powerade to a viable competitor. But the list of companies with the 
marketing resources and distribution power to compete against Gatorade under Coke is a short one. PepsiCo 
would have been unlikely to buy the brand, since doing so would have enabled Coke to complete the Quaker 
deal. 
Buying Quaker, which also has food brands such as Quaker cereals and Aunt Jemima, would have moved Coke 
beyond beverages for the first time since the late 1980s. Coke once owned a range of businesses, from Columbia 
Pictures to a manufacturer of plastic straws. But the Atlanta giant shed those businesses in the 1980s in order to 
focus on core beverage operations. 
Quaker was put into play earlier this month when PepsiCo entered talks to buy the Chicago company. But the 
Purchase, N.Y., beverage giant walked away from that possible bid. 
When he learned last week that Coke was in talks with Quaker, PepsiCo Chairman Roger Enrico told the 
company's board that a deal at the price Coke was said to be offering at the time wouldn't serve the company's 
shareholders, and Coke's potential acquisition of Quaker wouldn't affect PepsiCo's strategy, according to people 
close to PepsiCo.

PepsiCo, the soft drinks and snacks group, yesterday announced a $4bn share buyback programme, prompting 
questions about whether it had abandoned its pursuit of Quaker Oats. 
The announcement came two weeks after news emerged of Pepsi's approach to the maker of Gatorade sports 
drinks and breakfast cereals. 
The board of Pepsi's arch-rival, Coca-Cola, met yesterday to decide whether to proceed with its planned offer for 
Quaker Oats. 
Analysts believe that Pepsi and Danone, another of Quaker's suitors, would both struggle to compete with the 
strong currency of Coca-Cola stock if the Atlanta-based group can bring its discussions with Quaker to a 
successful conclusion. 
Pepsi's shares rallied $1.50 to $46.50 by the close yesterday on hopes it might avoid a bidding war. Coca-Cola 
shares slipped $1.31 to close at $55.25, as Quaker fell from $95 to $94.44. 
Pepsi would not comment on any merger or acquisition activity. People close to the company said they were not 
surprised some analysts had concluded the buyback ruled out large acquisitions, but that the decision should not 
preclude investments. 
Skip Carpenter, beverage analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said the Pepsi buyback should not rule out a 
bid for Quaker. "My view is that there are two separate dynamics. Pepsi has a growth formula of achieving 12 per 
cent earnings growth a year, and part of that formula is an ongoing buyback programme." 
However, other analysts said Pepsi would have to put such a programme on hold were it to account for a large 
acquisition under pooling-of-interests rules. 
Roger Enrico, Pepsi's chairman and chief executive, described the announcement as "a reflection of the strength 
of our businesses and our confidence in the consistent growth of Pepsi's already powerful cashflow". 
The new buyback programme was approved by Pepsi's board last Thursday - before Quaker's directors met this 
weekend to consider Coke's offer. 
Under the buyback plan, Pepsi would repurchase $4bn of stock over the next three years.

Danone Weighs Offer for Quaker Oats After Coca-Cola Drops Plan for Bid

ATLANTA -- France's Danone SA confirmed it is interested in Quaker Oats Inc. after Coca-Cola Co.'s board of 
directors decided not to buy Quaker for a reported $15.75 billion in stock, ending the soft-drink giant's pursuit of 
the nation's dominant sports beverage. 
Coca-Cola (KO) released a brief statement late Tuesday night announcing the decision and saying its board was 
enthusiastic about the company's direction under chairman and chief executive Douglas Daft. 
Quaker Oats, Chicago, declined comment. 
Even though Coke's management, led by Mr. Daft, brought the potential deal to the board, the directors 
expressed their confidence in his leadership. 
"The Board of The Coca-Cola Company expressed its enthusiastic support for the current strategic course of the 
Company under Doug Daft's leadership as the best means for enhancing shareowner value," Coke said in its 
statement. 
Earlier this month, Quaker Oats (OAT) rejected a $14.8 billion offer from PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) as insufficient. 
Coca-Cola began talks with Quaker Oats in part to prevent its main rival, PepsiCo, from acquiring Gatorade, 
which commands more than 83% of the U.S. retail market for sports drinks. 
Danone (DA), whose brands include Evian bottled water, remains in the running for Quaker. The French 
company Wednesday confirmed its "possible interest," saying it is "currently reviewing the situation at Quaker 
and its recent evolutions". 
Danone said its "possible interest is based on the fact that an agreement with Quaker could be consistent with 
Danone group's stated strategy of "developing a world leader in focused, growth-oriented, healthy nutrition and 
beverage businesses." 
A Coca-Cola deal for Quaker would have faced antitrust scrutiny, and industry observers questioned the 
beverage company's ability to effectively absorb Quaker's food business, which include Rice-A-Roni, Cap'n 
Crunch and Life cereals and Aunt Jemima pancake products. 
Because of antitrust concerns, regulators would have been likely to force Coke to sell its own sports-beverage 
brand, Powerade, which has 11% of the market. Coke likely would argue that measuring its market share only 
against sports drinks is too narrow a definition, since such drinks compete with bottled water and other brands. 
Coke's stock has been under pressure for the past couple of years because of poor earnings. Mr. Daft, who took 
the helm following former chief executive Douglas Ivestor's early retirement in December, restructured the 
company, laying off nearly 5,000 employees. Mr. Daft has made it clear that Coke sees a lot of potential growth 
outside the core cola market. Analysts also said investors were nervous about Coke straying from its core focus. 
Since news of Coke's discussions with Quaker was reported Sunday by The Wall Street Journal, Coke's market 
capitalization has been slashed by $15.35 billion, about the amount Coke was said to be offering in stock for the 
deal. Coke was said to be offering from 1.8 to 1.9 of its shares for each share of Quaker, but the proposal 
reportedly had a "collar" that would adjust the ratio depending on where Coke stock is trading. 
After dropping sharply Monday, Coke's stock fell further Tuesday as investors awaited the board's decision. At 4 
p.m. Tuesday, Coca-Cola shares were down $1.31 to $55.25, while Quaker shares were off 56 cents at $94.44 
and PepsiCo stock was up $1.50 to $46.50, all in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

Some Coca-Cola directors had been expected to back the deal, which would give Coke a big push in the 
fast-growing noncarbonated beverage business and keep the Gatorade sports drink out of PepsiCo's hands. 
Others, including billionaire Warren Buffett, were said to be skeptical. Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 
(BRKA, BRKB) is Coke's biggest shareholder, with 200 million shares, or 8% of the total. 
Cola sales, which have long constituted Coke's core business, have been flat in recent years as more 
health-conscious consumers turn to bottled waters, teas and other noncarbonated drinks. 
Despite its North American popularity, Gatorade has had little introduction elsewhere. Coke would have brought a 
potent distribution network to the brand, analysts said. 
PepsiCo, Purchase, N.Y., walked away from a possible bid for Quaker last week. After learning that Coca-Cola 
was in talks with Quaker, Pepsi chairman Roger Enrico told his board that a bidding war wouldn't serve the 
company's shareholders and said the potential acquisition of Quaker by Coca-Cola wouldn't affect PepsiCo's 
strategy, according to people close to PepsiCo. 
Although best known for its cereal brands, Quaker has posted 11 straight quarters of double-digit profit gains, 
thanks largely to the beverage line, which accounts for more than 40% of company sales.

PURCHASE, N.Y., Nov 21 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc., the soft drink and snack company, said on Tuesday its board 
has authorized the repurchase of $4 billion in stock over the next three years. 
The timing of the announcement raised some eyebrows on Wall Street because of Pepsi's reported interest in 
buying Quaker Oats Co.. Earlier this month it was widely reported that Pepsi had held talks to buy Quaker, but 
that they fell apart over price. Yesterday, Coca-Cola Co. confirmed that it was in talks with Quaker about a 
possible deal. 
Pepsi has repeatedly declined to comment on any possible plans to bid for Quaker, the cereal maker also known 
for its leading Gatorade sports drink brand. 
Coca-Cola is set to have a board meeting later in the day on Tuesday, where the fate of its bid for Quaker could 
be determined. 
According to one beverage industry analyst, the buyback announcement does not necessarily mean Pepsi should 
be ruled out as a possible buyer of Quaker. 
"I think it's sort of Pepsi's vote of confidence in the value of its shares, but it's still not necessarily saying they're 
completely out of the running until they actually buy the stock back," UBS Warburg's Caroline Levy said. 
"It says they think their stock is undervalued, it says they're committed to buying the stock back over the long 
term, but it doesn't tell me anything about the immediate future." 
The new program will go into effect once the current $3 billion program is completed. PepsiCo expects the current 
program, which was authorized in March 1999, to be completed by early 2001. 
"This new share repurchase program is a reflection of the strength of our businesses and our confidence in the 
consistent growth of PepsiCo's already powerful cash flow," Pepsico chairman and chief executive officer Roger 
Enrico said in a statement. 
"We are fortunate in being able to invest in growth opportunities, pay a healthy dividend and buy back a 
substantial number of shares all at the same time." 
Just last week, chief financial officer Indra Nooyi said the current buyback program is on track for completion a 
year ahead of the original schedule. Since the beginning of 1996, PepsiCo has invested about $9 billion in share 
repurchases, including $1.3 billion so far this year. 
Shares of Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo were up $1-5/16, or 2.92 percent, at $46-5/16 early Tuesday afternoon 
trading.

PepsiCo Plans to Repurchase $4 Billion in Stock over Next Three Years

PURCHASE, N.Y. -- PepsiCo Inc. said its board has approved the repurchase of up to $4 billion of stock over the 
next three years. 
The company said the repurchase program will go into effect upon the completion of its current $3 billion 
program, which was authorized in March 1999 and is expected to be completed by early 2001. 
PepsiCo (PEP) shares were up $1.50, or 3.3%, to $46.50 at 4 p.m. EST Tuesday on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
The company, which recently made an unsuccessful bid to acquire Quaker Oats Co., said it has invested about 
$1.3 billion in share repurchases so far this year. PepsiCo has about 1.4 billion shares outstanding. 
"This new share repurchase program is a reflection of the strength of our businesses and our confidence in the 
consistent growth of PepsiCo's already powerful cash flow," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Roger Enrico 
said in a prepared statement. 
The company reported sales of $18.24 billion for fiscal 1999. 
PepsiCo was ready to offer about $14 billion in stock for Chicago-based Quaker (OAT) but walked away from 
talks earlier this month when the two sides failed to reach an agreement on price. PepsiCo was primarily 
interested in adding Quaker's fast-growing Gatorade sports-drink business to its beverage stable. 
PepsiCo made an initial overture to Quaker some time back, and the two sides had extensive discussions, going 
back and forth on price. PepsiCo made a "final" offer, proposing to exchange about 2.2 of its shares for each 
share of Quaker. 
Quaker rejected that offer too low, and PepsiCo's Mr. Enrico refused to sweeten the bid, concerned that a higher 
offer would dilute PepsiCo's earnings, a person familiar with the matter said. Mr. Enrico is believed to have been 
very concerned about not damaging Pepsi's credibility with Wall Street, where Pepsi stock has been a strong 
performer. 
On Monday, Coca-Cola Co. (KO) confirmed it is in talks "regarding a possible transaction" with Quaker.

A Return Visit to Earlier Stories -- Enrico's Gambit: With Gatorade, Pepsi would gain a big leg up on Coke; 
don't count a Quaker deal out yet

(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
In a year in which the stock market's key indexes all have traded sharply lower, shares of PepsiCo, the Purchase, 
New York-based snack foods and beverage giant, have rallied more than 38%, to around 49. The stock's strong 
performance not only validates Chairman Roger Enrico's five-year transformation of Pepsi into a premier product 
innovator and marketing machine, a process chronicled this year in a cover story in Barron's ("Chipping Away", 
June 12), but provides the company with valuable currency as it seeks to grow beyond its core businesses of 
salty snacks and carbonated drinks. 
What is the future value of that currency? The question lies at the heart of Pepsi's recently rebuffed all-stock bid 
for Quaker Oats, and may lead to a reworking of the terms of the deal if Pepsi is to snare the real prize: Quaker's 
vaunted Gatorade sportsdrink franchise, which accounted for 40% of Quaker's 1999 revenues of $5 billion. 
Gatorade would be the jewel in the crown of Pepsi's growing stable of noncarbonated beverages, at a time when 
consumers are kicking the carbonated soft-drink habit in favor of juices, bottled waters, New Age teas and 
performance drinks. 
Pepsi offered 2.2 of its own shares for each Quaker share -- a generous exchange that values Quaker at about 
$14 billion, or 106 a share, some 22% above Quaker's current price of 86.56. But if Pepsi's stock tumbles, as is 
often the case with the buyer's shares, Quaker holders might wind up with less than they'd bargained for. And 
therein lies the rub. 
Talks between the companies reportedly have broken off, and neither side is commenting on the situation; both 
declined to discuss the matter with Barron's. But some industry observers believe a hybrid cash-and-stock bid, or 
a deal that affords Quaker holders some downside protection, could raise the odds that Pepsi will prevail. While a 
cash/stock offer conceivably would be dilutive to Pepsi holders, the compelling long-term outlook for a 
Pepsi/Gatorade union might outweigh the market's near-term concerns. 
That, at any rate, is how Bill Pecoriello, Sanford Bersnstein's beverage analyst, sizes up the situation. Back in 
March, Pecoriello penned a provocative -- and apparently prophetic -- report in which he posited that PepsiCo 
could purchase Quaker Oats in tandem with a third party that would acquire Quaker's large cereal business. 
While the argument raised eyebrows in the industry, it was dismissed on the twin grounds that Pepsi wouldn't 
tolerate dilution while Quaker wasn't for sale. 
Like it or not, however, Quaker is now in play. As for other bidders, Philip Morris has its hands full with its new 
Nabisco holdings, while Pepsi rival Coca-Cola's own house is in disarray. Unless a European outfit such as 
Cadbury-Schweppes, Nestle or Danone "is willing to overpay," Quaker's stock will drift lower, Pecoriello says, 
and the company might come knocking on Pepsi's door again, perhaps seeking a deal with a cash component. 
Barring a rival bid, both sides can afford to be patient. Gatorade boasts about 83% of the market for sports drinks 
and has been growing about 10% a year. Meanwhile Coke and Pepsi's sports-drink challengers remain 
comparative weaklings. Just the same, Pepsi's in fine shape without Gatorade, although, as Pecoriello notes, 
"Gatorade is more valuable in Pepsi's hands than Quaker's." He figures Pepsi could get "a 10% volume lift" 
merely by selling Gatorade through its vendingmachine channel, not to mention leveraging the brand through its 
extensive retail distribution network.

Tom Pirko, of Bevmark, a Santa Barbara, California-based industry consultant, believes Gatorade represents "the 
ultimate chance for Pepsi to get the jump on Coke." Not to buy it, he argues, would be a big mistake. "It's in 
Pepsi's interest to pay more. I think investors will see it strategically," he says. 
By the same token, Coke might feel compelled to keep the prize out of Pepsi's hands, which could create a 
doubly interesting opportunity for Chicago-based Quaker. Under Chairman Robert Morrison, Quaker Oats also 
has undergone a wrenching transformation in recent years. This year its shares have nearly doubled from a 
52-week low of 45.81. 
Should Pepsi prevail in its Quaker quest, it won't be the company's first acquisition since June. Late last month 
Pepsi shelled out $370 million in cash for 90% of South Beach Beverage Co., maker of the SoBe brand of 
noncarbonated herbal beverages, after Coke wavered in its bid for the company. SoBe will join Pepsi's strong 
noncarbonated line-up, which includes the No. 1 bottled water (Aquafina) and the top-selling brewed bottled tea 
(Lipton Brisk). Pepsi also owns Tropicana, the best-selling orange juice. 
Even with Gatorade in its corporate cupboard, however, Pepsi's fortunes would continue to rest on the growth of 
its Frito-Lay snack foods division, which last year accounted for 62% of pro forma sales of $18.7 billion, and 66% 
of pro forma operating profits of $3 billion. Powered once again by Frito-Lay, Pepsi is expected to earn $1.45 a 
share this year, and $1.64 in 2001, compared with $1.24 in 1999. The company sports a price/earnings multiple 
of 29 times 2001 expected earnings, and has been edging ever closer to parity with Coke, which sells for 36 times

BRADENTON, Fla. -- At a company whose name is almost synonymous with orange juice, Albert Bolles leads a 
brigade of researchers looking for ways to sell a lot more of it. 
The 43-year-old food scientist is behind Tropicana Products Inc.'s campaign to dominate the orange-juice 
business by transforming the simplest of commodity beverages into a highly engineered "nutriceutical" crammed 
with extra vitamins and minerals. Under Mr. Bolles's watch, the world's largest fruit-juice producer added calcium 
and vitamins C and E to its orange juice. And last week, Tropicana, a unit of PepsiCo. Inc., got the green light 
from the government to tell consumers that the potassium found naturally in orange juice is good for their hearts. 
If you want to know where the world of drinks is headed, forget cola. After years of growth, soft-drink sales in the 
U.S. are nearly flat. The big battle is over the stuff without fizz, and Pepsi is moving ahead on a number of fronts. 
Tropicana has 44% of the market for chilled orange juice. In the huge bottled-water business, Pepsi's Aquafina 
has the leading market share. And Pepsi is on the attack in the hippest category of all: New Age juice blends and 
teas with added nutrients and herbs. Pepsi began last week by swiping a hot little company -- South Beach 
Beverage Co., maker of teas and juice blends such as "Lizard Fuel" and "Tsunami" -- before Coca-Cola Co. could 
get it. But it ended the week with a failed attempt to acquire Quaker Oats Co., owner of Gatorade, one of the 
most successful noncarbonated drinks ever. 
Quaker rejected Pepsi's $14 billion bid as too low. As of yesterday, discussions hadn't reopened between Pepsi 
and Quaker. (See related article on page A4.) Gatorade is up for grabs. But whoever ends up with it, there's an 
arrestingly clear development in one of the business world's great rivalries. PepsiCo, of Purchase, N.Y., long the 
underdog in its battle with Coke, is finally beginning to get its act together, as its Atlanta-based competitor 
struggles through a restructuring. As PepsiCo negotiated to buy Quaker last Thursday, some Coke board 
members and executives spoke by phone to consider the ramifications. 
They might start by looking at Tropicana, a company that went through three corporate owners before Pepsi 
bought it two years ago for $3.3 billion from Seagram Co. At the time, Wall Street critics found it perplexing at 
best. Coke's Minute Maid Co. unit vowed that it would be the one to "own the breakfast occasion." Yet today, 
Tropicana remains king. Its share of the chilled orange-juice market, the fastest-growing segment of the juice 
business, is more than twice that of Minute Maid. 
This year, Tropicana's Pure Premium juice passed Campbell's Soup as the No. 3 seller among supermarket 
brands. Now, Tropicana aims to be No. 1 by 2005. That means overtaking its corporate sibling, Pepsi Cola, and 
Coca-Cola Classic, the reigning No. 1. 
Tropicana, founded in the 1940s when former Long Island grocer Anthony T. Rossi started shipping gift boxes of 
citrus from Florida to New York, has been touted over the years by spokesmen from actor Eddie Albert to retired 
basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Its Pure Premium juice -- squeezed fresh, stored in tanks and later 
packaged in cartons, rather than reconstituted from concentrate like Minute Maid -- is also famous for its diehard 
fans like B.J. Chorey. 
In an Atlanta supermarket the other day, Ms. Chorey, a former Coke employee and mother of two teenagers, 
tosses away loyalties to her onetime employer and reaches for a 96-ounce megabottle of Tropicana Pure 
Premium Grovestand orange juice. "Tropicana is superior in taste," she says. "We drink it like water."

Such passion was one reason PepsiCo chairman and chief executive Roger Enrico decided to acquire the 
company. "We were astonished at the depth of consumer loyalty," he says. Tropicana fit into the vision Mr. Enrico 
and his lieutenants had laid out for PepsiCo: focus on convenience and impulse foods and beverages. 
The big brand name was only part of it. They also saw Tropicana as a way for Pepsi to plunge into the new trend 
toward "functional" products -- foods and drinks that are naturally nutritious and can be fortified to pack lots of 
power for time-conscious consumers. After years of trying to persuade people to drink soft drinks in the morning, 
Pepsi had an instant invitation to the breakfast table. 
"There were so many reasons to buy Tropicana, strategic and financial," Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's chief financial 
officer, told a gathering of investors and analysts earlier this year. Tropicana Pure Premium juice, she said, is 
"growing like crazy and making lots of money, even more than we expected." 
In this year's first nine months, Tropicana's operating profit jumped 35% from a year earlier to $157 million. Sales 
rose 5.4% to $1.63 billion. The reason can be found at Tropicana headquarters in Bradenton. At a new $17 
million research center, nutritionists plumb the contents of orange juice to learn what is in it, studying health 
surveys to determine what more might be added. Leading the way is Mr. Bolles, Tropicana's head of global 
technology and quality. 
A former director of product development at Gerber Products Co., Mr. Bolles helped put Tropicana on the track to 
fast growth after arriving in 1993. His experience at a baby-food company, he says, showed him how much 
consumers focus on nutrition. With ad slogans such as "Tropicana's got the taste that shows on your face" and "If 
it tasted any fresher it would still be on the tree," Tropicana had long focused its marketing efforts on taste. But 
the company's new chief executive officer, Ellen Marram, thought the health message needed to be played up. So 
Tropicana decided, Mr. Bolles says, "to show consumers there's so much more to orange juice than vitamin C." 
One way was to order up a bunch of clinical studies. 
An initial attempt to fortify orange juice with calcium in 1995 flopped because the calcium "fortification" produced a 
chalky taste. But sales of Pure Premium took off when Tropicana changed it to something called Fruitcal, which is 
completely tasteless. The company also timed the release of the new product to publication of a study by the 
National Academy of Sciences citing a need for more calcium in the American diet. Juice fortified with double 
vitamins C and E, to boost immunity, was also introduced that year. Sales of fortified Pure Premium juice grew 
35% every year since then, the company says. 
Tropicana executives think another growth spurt could come from proving that orange juice can help prevent 
heart disease. Tropicana funds research projects from Cleveland to Hawaii to pinpoint orange juice's benefits. A 
study done by the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1997 showed that two glasses of orange juice in a daily diet 
reduces risk of heart disease by increasing levels of blood folate by 43%. 
Mr. Bolles considered the study so important that he hired the nutritionist who conducted the research. The 
nutritionist, Carla McGill, then researched and wrote a health claim that the company won approval for last week 
from the Food and Drug Administration. The resulting claim says that potassium, found naturally in orange juice, 
helps reduce the risk of high blood pressure and stroke. 
Mr. Bolles is hoping more proof will come out of a more comprehensive study being conducted by the Cleveland 
Clinic Heart Center, a leading cardiac-care center. In that study, cardiac patients drink Tropicana orange juice 
delivered to their homes, and regularly submit to blood tests to determine if the juice is helping reduce the risk of 
heart disease. Test results are expected to be released in March. 
Other studies showed more advantages: Orange juice increases levels of good cholesterol. The juice contains 
170 "phytochemicals," compounds found naturally in fruits and vegetables that may help reduce the risk of cancer 
and bear other health benefits. All orange juice makers benefit from these claims, but Tropicana is taking 
especially elaborate steps to do so. 
On store shelves, Tropicana wants to make its juices, which also include Dole fruit juices, as trendy and 
convenient as the other New Age beverages. "Those other drinks are about excitement and marketing," says 
Brock Leach, Tropicana's president and chief executive officer. "We have more to say nutritionally." The 
challenge, he says, is to get those nutritious drinks on more shelves in places such as convenience stores. 
Until a year ago, Mr. Leach was head of development at Pepsi's snack-food unit, Frito-Lay, where steady growth 
depends heavily on coming up with new flavors and packaging. Now, he is applying what he learned at Frito-Lay 
to Tropicana. "We're going from being a manufacturing company to a marketing company," he says.

Page 128 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Tropicana is designing a plastic bottle for Pure Premium juice that will fit into a car cupholder. It expects to have it 
on the market at the end of next year. Mr. Leach hopes that will be a way to get orange juice into more "dayparts" 
than just breakfast. Early in the year, Tropicana hopes to capture more of the eat-and-run set with a fruit and dairy 
breakfast smoothie that packs the same vitamins and minerals as a bowl of fortified cereal with milk. And a new 
juice blend for children in kid-friendly sizes, called Drenchers, will be rolled out in the middle of the year. 
After corporate owners including the former Beatrice Foods, Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts and Seagram, some 
think Tropicana has found a good home. Pepsi has helped Tropicana invest in everything from new refrigerated 
rail cars to store coolers. At the end of this year, Pepsi bottlers will begin distributing Dole juices in small bottles. 
"Pepsi is a perfect home for Tropicana," says Ms. Marram, who served as CEO from 1993 to 1998, and left when 
Pepsi bought the company from Seagram. "Pepsi understands the potential." 
Pepsi itself has gone through a revitalization. After trouble in the mid-1990s with an ill-fated overseas expansion, 
the company underwent a tumultuous four years of restructuring. It scaled back international operations, reined in 
costs, and spun off its restaurants and bottling operations. 
Along with the Tropicana acquisition, the moves transformed PepsiCo into a company tightly focused on 
nonalcoholic drinks and its huge Frito-Lay snacks unit, which makes up about two-thirds of sales. Pepsi shares 
were in the low $30s when Mr. Enrico took charge in the spring of 1996. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange 
composite trading Friday, they closed at $45.81. Analysts who used to brace themselves for bad news at 
earnings time now praise the company for consistency and expect PepsiCo to generate annual growth of 12% to 
13% in earnings per share over the next three to five years. With the hard work behind him, Mr. Enrico plans to 
turn the reins over to his No. 2, Steven Reinemund. 
Even in a stagnant domestic market, carbonated-beverage sales make up the lion's share of beverage sales at 
Pepsi, and it isn't clear how much of a fad the funky mixed-blend drinks will be. But with more growth expected for 
the moment from nutrient-enhanced drinks, the company hopes to rely more on Tropicana as an innovation 
incubator. Tropicana and Pepsi executives already meet to study new trends in beverages. One result: a recent 
internal analysis called "The World of Beverage Study," in which participants kept diaries of what they drank at 
different points in the day. 
Rival Minute Maid hasn't put as much muscle into nutrition science as Tropicana. But the Houston-based 
company isn't standing still. It was the first of the two juice producers to put calcium in orange juice, in 1987, and 
has added it to other juices, such as grapefruit and juice boxes for children. The company also put a combination 
of vitamins C, E and zinc into orange juice recently, and rolled out chilled orange juice with low acid, a product 
that Tropicana has yet to introduce. It also has a bigger share of the market for nonrefrigerated juices. 
Coke, with Fruitopia juice drinks, Nestea iced tea and Dasani water, is still a major player in noncarbonated 
beverages, and has the strongest position of anyone overseas. But Pepsi, which mapped out a strategy to 
become a "total beverage company" as early as 1992, has grabbed the No. 1 slot in some of the fastest-growing 
domestic categories. Besides its leading bottled water, Pepsi's Lipton -- a joint venture with Unilever -- is the 
top-selling iced-tea brand. It also markets a coffee drink, Frappucino, in a joint venture with Starbucks Corp., and 
now has the South Beach Beverage brands. 
With SoBe out of its reach, Coke is under pressure to develop New Age drinks on its own. The possibility that 
Gatorade could fall into Pepsi's hands adds a new threat. Coke's Powerade holds an 11% share of the 
sports-drink market, to Gatorade's 83.6%. 
Jeffrey Dunn, president of Coke's North American operations, says Coke has 27 new products in the works for 
the North American market, including carbonated and noncarbonated beverages. Alliances and acquisitions will 
also be considered, Mr. Dunn says. Meanwhile, Coke is also collaborating with Minute Maid to plumb the "white 
space" of new beverage categories likely to arise. Industry experts say the future of beverages is in 
nutrient-enhanced waters and juices with even more emphasis on nutrients. 
"We're going to be more aggressive and have a continuous flow of things into the marketplace," Mr. Dunn says. 
"The cola wars are going to be played now across a lot of different battlefields."

Quaker snubs PepsiCo's 9.3bn pounds takeover offer. 
Quaker snubs PepsiCo's 9.3bn pounds takeover offer.

UNITED STATES cereal and soft drinks group Quaker Oats has rejected a takeover approach from PepsiCo 
after the drinks giant made a 9.3 billion offer. 
PepsiCo, which has long been interested in Quaker because of its successful Gatorade sports drink, had been 
talking about offering around two of its shares for each Quaker share, valuing the company at around 71 pounds 
per share. 
However, it is understood the bid was rejected at a meeting between the two companies last night. 
PepsiCo's approach came amid signs that the breakfast cereal and sports drink maker is ready to become the 
latest target of the consolidation in the US foods industry, with Quaker unlikely to continue as an independent 
company. 
Other consumer companies, including French group Danone and Swiss chocolate giant Nestle, are also thought 
to have expressed interest in buying Quaker. 
Industry observers said PepsiCo would have purchased Quaker Oats for its flagship beverage brand, Gatorade, 
which has an 80 per cent market share in the US. PepsiCo's own sports drink brand, Allsport, has seen its market 
share decline while Coca-Cola's Powerade has gained ground over the past two years. 
In 1999, Allsport had only a 4.2 per cent share of the US market, down from 6.7 per cent in 1998, and Powerade's 
market share was at 12.3 per cent in 1999, up from 11.6 per cent the year before. 
After years of stagnation, there has been a flurry of consolidation in the US food industry this year, including 
Unilever's takeover of Bestfoods, Kraft's acquisition of biscuit maker Nabisco and the purchase of Pillsbury by 
General Mills. And just last week, Kellogg snapped up Keebler for 2.6bn. 
Quaker Oats has been one of the best performers in the US food industry this year. Its shares have risen a 
quarter since January and are close to their recent all-time high. At yesterday's close of 58.75 pounds, the group 
is capitalised at around 8.1bn, and at the end of June, Quaker had around 357m of net debt. 
PepsiCo has done even better. Its stock has risen by a third this year due to strong results, lifting its market value 
to nearly 50bn. The group has also successfully integrated Tropicana, the juice company it bought for 2.4bn just 
over two years ago. 
The fit between the two companies appeared good. Though most famous for its cola, PepsiCo is one of the 
world's leading snack food makers, with brands like Doritos, Fritos and Cracker Jack. Its Frito-Lay subsidiary, 
which also owns Walkers crisps in the UK, will contribute around two-thirds of this year's forecast sales of 14bn 
and a similar proportion of profits. Pepsi accounts for a quarter of sales with Tropicana making up the remainder. 
Quaker Oats recently saw a 16 per cent jump in profits - thanks to high demand for its increasingly popular 
Gatorade sports drink. 
The Chicago-based food company said earnings rose to 109m for the last quarter, compared with 94.5m in the 
same period a year ago. 
Quaker said total sales over the period had risen to the 1.2bn mark.

PepsiCo also recently announced a better-than-expected 21 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings, driven by 
double-digit gains at its snacks and juice businesses. 
The New York-based company, which controls more than half of the US snack market and 30 per cent of its soft 
drink market, said profits rose to 375m from 311m a year earlier. 
PepsiCo chairman and chief executive Roger Enrico said the company's volume gains in the second quarter 
reflected the strength of the business.

PepsiCo Sets Its Sights On Acquiring Quaker Oats --- Companies Are Said to Be in Talks Over a Proposed

PepsiCo Inc. has been holding high-level talks to acquire Quaker Oats Co. for about $13 billion (15 billion euros) 
in stock, a move that would put the powerhouse Gatorade brands in its arsenal, say people familiar with the 
matter. 
The talks are fluid and could fall apart at any time, these people cautioned. One person familiar with the matter 
said the chances of a deal "are about 50-50 at this point." 
Pepsi has been looking at the Chicago food-and-beverage company for years, but Quaker could easily flirt with 
other suitors. It would be a tempting target for European companies. Swiss giant Nestle SA and French company 
Danone SA, which have large bottled-water businesses in the U.S., have missed out on the recent feeding frenzy 
among U.S. companies and could be anxious to make a move. And then there's Coca-Cola Co., which would 
hate to see Gatorade slip into the arms of its archrival. 
PepsiCo is believed to have offered slightly more than two of its shares for each share of Quaker, which would 
value Quaker at close to $100 a share. As of Thursday, it wasn't clear whether Quaker would find that exchange 
ratio acceptable. The two sides were continuing to negotiate. 
At 4 p.m. trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of PepsiCo fell 93.8 cents to $47.06 each, while 
Quaker shares were unchanged at $82.25 apiece. 
Representatives of PepsiCo, based in Purchase, New York, and Quaker both declined to comment. 
The U.S. food industry is rapidly consolidating, and Quaker Oats has long been considered the most attractive 
food company -- precisely because of the strength of its nonfood business, Gatorade. The powerhouse sports 
drink posted sales of $1.8 billion last year, up from $100 million in 1984 when Quaker acquired the brand. 
Despite repeated assaults by the like of Coca-Cola's Powerade brand and Pepsi's All-Sport, Gatorade commands 
more than 80% of the sports-drink market and continues to grow at a rapid clip. 
Quaker has been seen for some time as the most obvious acquisition for Pepsi. The major sticking points have 
been Quaker's slow-growing cereal business and the lofty price. PepsiCo has staked its future on higher-growth 
segments of the food-and-beverage industry. It would love to get its hands on Gatorade and even likes Quaker's 
grain-based snacks, which could be marketed through Frito-Lay's well-regarded distribution system. But Quaker's 
beverage business accounts for only about 45% of sales and operating income; the bulk of the business is still 
food products, from the trademark Quaker oatmeal to Cap'n Crunch and Life Cereal to Golden Grain and 
Rice-A-Roni. 
Pepsi trades at about 29 times next year's earnings, while Quaker is closer to 22 times earnings, giving Pepsi the 
financial strength to make the deal. But Quaker would certainly be a pricey acquisition; its stock has risen 25% 
this year, giving it a market capitalization of $11.3 billion. (PepsiCo's stock has risen an even sharper 36%.) And 
depending on the price and the potential for cost savings, the deal could dilute Pepsi's earnings -- potentially 
upsetting Pepsi investors. 
That said, many analysts have said a Quaker deal would be a good fit for PepsiCo. Both companies have 
engineered major turnarounds, returning to Wall Street's favor after huge disappointments a few years ago. 
Quaker hit its nadir in 1996, dragged down by the botched acquisition of Snapple, which it sold the following year

Page 132 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
for $300 million, $1.4 billion less than it had paid in 1994. At about the same time, PepsiCo's restaurant business 
was hitting weak sales and its international operations suffered embarrassing losses. 
Under Roger Enrico, who took over as chief executive in 1996, PepsiCo has worked hard to transform itself from 
a diffuse company into one that is focused on snacks and nonalcoholic beverages. Mr. Enrico spun off the 
fast-food restaurant operations, took public its bottling business and acquired Tropicana juices. Indeed, the 
success of the Tropicana deal, initially viewed skeptically because of the high price, may have emboldened 
PepsiCo to act now to buy Quaker. Not only has Tropicana performed well, analysts say it has given Pepsi 
access to Tropicana's research on "functional" beverages, a segment of drinks with supposed health attributes. 
At Quaker, Robert Morrison, CEO since late 1997, has gotten kudos from Wall Street for shedding some small 
food businesses and focusing the company on the beverage business, including extending the Gatorade brand 
with new flavors and brands. The company has introduced a new fitness water, Propel, in select markets. Quaker 
has also leveraged the Gatorade brand by introducing energy bars. 
Missed Opportunity 
Executives at Pepsi, Coca-Cola and other companies have long kicked themselves for not buying Gatorade and 
Snapple when the two brands were being sold as a package deal -- for a much lower price -- by Quaker Oats in 
the midst of Snapple's woes. 
Aside from the strategic fit, one reason Pepsi may be attracted now is concern that another buyer will swoop in. 
Pepsi's timing may be fortuitous. Not only is its stock price surging, but rival Coca-Cola is beset by weak earnings 
and preoccupied with shoring up its business, following the resignation a year ago of Douglas Ivester as CEO. 
Pepsi just this week beat out Coca-Cola to buy South Beach Beverage Co., a hip marketer of New Age drinks. 
In a research note earlier this week, Andrew Lazar, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, wrote that the South Beach 
deal and the recent sale of Snapple to Cadbury Schweppes PLC not only reduces "the availability of well-known, 
functional noncarbonated beverage assets, but should also once again raise the specter of a future Gatorade 
deal." 
In the first six months of this year, Gatorade and Gatorade Frost had a commanding 84% of the U.S. "take-home" 
market, which covers retail stores. Coca-Cola's Powerade brand had an 11% share, while All-Sport was at 3.1%, 
according to Beverage Digest, an industry publication. 
Pepsi would almost certainly discontinue All-Sport to win antitrust approval of a deal. That shouldn't be much of 
an issue; top executives have for some time privately talked about dropping the brand because of weak sales. By 
contrast, a purchase of Gatorade by Coca-Cola would present problems, analysts say, because of Coca-Cola's 
very public commitment to its Powerade brand. 
Despite Gatorade's dominance, analysts have long believed it could get a big boost if it were more readily 
available in vending machines and convenience stores, two strengths of the Pepsi and Coca-Cola distribution 
systems. William Pecoriello, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who has long predicted a PepsiCo-Quaker deal, 
wrote in a March 13 research note that being more available in Pepsi vending machines could increase 
Gatorade's volume by 10% over five years. A sale to Pepsi would also allow Gatorade to tap into Pepsi's network 
of international bottlers; Quaker Oats has long struggled with increasing Gatorade's sales outside the U.S. 
In the note last March, Mr. Pecoriello said Gatorade would give Pepsi "the most attractive noncarbonated portfolio 
in the marketplace" at a time when consumers are shying away from carbonated drinks. Mr. Pecoriello and others 
have often believed that PepsiCo should make a joint bid with a company that would be willing to take Quaker's 
cereal business off its hands. But such joint bids are difficult and can create tax complications.

NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Beverage and snack food giant PepsiCo Inc tried to buy cereal and sports drink 
maker Quaker Oats Co for about $14 billion in stock, but walked away Thursday night when the two sides failed 
to reach an agreement on price, the Wall Street Journal reported in its electronic edition late Thursday. 
Citing people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said PepsiCo and Quaker engaged in extensive 
discussions, going back and forth on price, and that PepsiCo Thursday made a final offer proposing to exchange 
about 2.2 of its shares for each share of Quaker. 
PepsiCo is thought to have had its sights set on Quaker's popular sports drink Gatorade, which accounts for 
about 40 percent of Quaker's revenues and sales and had an 82 percent share of the U.S. sports drink market 
last year. 
Pepsi shares finished off 15/16 at $47-1/16 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Given the reported 
2.2 exchange ratio, that would value Quaker Oats at $103.53 per share, or a 26 percent premium to Quaker 
Oats' closing price Thursday of $82-1/4. 
Quaker Oats rejected Pepsi's bid as too low, but Pepsi's chairman and chief executive, Roger Enrico, refused to 
sweeten the bid due to concerns that a higher offer would dilute PepsiCo's per-share earnings, the paper 
reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. 
Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment, the paper said.

NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Beverage and snack food giant PepsiCo Inc. has been holding talks to acquire 
cereal and sports drink maker Quaker Oats Co. , the Wall Street Journal's electronic edition reported on 
Thursday. 
The maker of Frito-Lay chips, Pepsi soft drinks and Tropicana juices may buy Quaker Oats for about $13 billion 
in stock, or the equivalent of about $100 a share, people familiar with the matter said, according to the report. 
PepsiCo spokesman Dick Detweiler and Quaker spokesman Mark Dollins both declined to comment, saying their 
policies are not to comment on rumours or speculation. 
PepsiCo sees Gatorade sports drinks as the prize, as growth on the food products side has lagged, analysts said. 
Gatorade accounts for about 40 percent of Quaker's revenues and sales and had an 82 percent share of the U.S. 
sports drink market last year. 
"Quaker is clearly the most attractive acquisition of the food companies that are left," said David Nelson, food 
industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. 
The move would give Pepsi a huge boost in the beverage market. Both Pepsi's All-Sport and Coca-Cola Co.'s 
Powerade lag well behind Gatorade in the sports drink arena. 
"Gatorade is the Tiffany of non-carbonated beverages," ING Barings beverage analyst Emanuel Goldman said. "It 
is the creme de la creme of sports drinks." 
"Putting that into PepsiCo's already strong beverage system would be a very good fit," Patrick Schumann, food 
analyst with Edward Jones, said. 
Quaker, which also makes hot and cold cereals, breakfast bars, Rice-A-Roni side dishes and Aunt Jemima 
pancake mixes and syrup, has been the subject of merger rumours for years, thought to be too small to expand 
globally on its own. 
But Schumann said Quaker's namesake might be at the bottom of the wish list. "I can't imagine they'd want to be 
in the ready-to-eat cereal business." 
Goldman said Pepsi would likely sell off Quaker's food businesses, which wouldn't necessarily mesh with salty 
snacks such as Fritos and Doritos. "Rice-A-Roni you'd have no trouble selling, the cereal part of it Post or 
someone would come in in two seconds, that's not a problem." 
Analysts said Quaker would carry a big price tag, as it carries very little debt on its balance sheet. 
"This would be almost a 25 percent premium," Nelson said. "It's a hefty valuation but there are clearly synergies." 
Quaker reportedly was in talks in recent months with Nestle SA . There has been talk since this spring that 
European food and beverage giants, such as Nestle, Group Danone and Cadbury Schweppes, would make a 
stronger push into the U.S. market. Just last week, Cadbury completed its purchase of the Snapple Beverage 
Group from Triarc Cos Inc. 
"The real question is whether Nestle will get into the fray," Prudential Securities food industry analyst John 
McMillin said.

Goldman said Pepsi's possible buy of Quaker would be a key move before Chairman and Chief Executive Roger 
Enrico steps down over the next two years. "Enrico knows what he wants this company to be," Goldman said. 
"The non-carb part of it, if he can establish that strongly before he retires, he'll do it." 
Goldman said not to count Coca-Cola out of the game. "Coke would have the potential to take Gatorade 
international," with a worldwide network that is much larger than Pepsi's. 
"There's clearly the possibility of other bidders," Nelson said. 
According to the Wall Street Journal report, those familiar with the talks said they may fall apart at any time. A 
meeting on whether to go ahead was expected Thursday evening, it said. 
Pepsi on Monday said it would acquire a 90 percent stake in South Beach Beverage Co., the maker of the SoBe 
line of new age drinks. Though Pepsi had been eyeing SoBe for at least two years, the deal was put together in 
the last two weeks, beating out Coca-Cola, which had been in months-long talks to buy a stake in SoBe. 
On Thursday, shares of PepsiCo closed off 15/16 at $47-1/16. Quaker shares closed at $82-1/14, near their 
all-time high of $84-13/16 hit earlier this week.

Pepsi likely to continue pursuit of Quaker - analysts.

NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Beverage industry analysts still see Quaker Oats Co., particularly its booming 
Gatorade sports drinks business, as a good possible buy for PepsiCo Inc., even though talks between the two 
food and beverage giants fizzled last night. 
According to various reports, Purchase, N.Y.-based Pepsi, whose products range from soft drinks to Frito-Lay 
snacks and Tropicana juices, had been in talks to buy Chicago-based Quaker for about $14 billion in stock, but 
walked away late Thursday when the two companies failed to meet on price. 
Pepsi is most likely heading back to the drawing board to try and salvage the talks, analysts said on Friday. 
"If they were going to do an acquisition, this is the one I'd like them to do," UBS Warburg's Caroline Levy said. 
"It's nice to see them being disciplined on price. I'm not convinced the deal is dead." 
Sanford C. Bernstein's William Pecoriello, who had predicted a possible Pepsi buy of Quaker back in March, still 
thinks the deal could go through. 
"Although the stock prices have changed quite a bit, the strategic rationale remains intact," Pecoriello said in a 
note. "In our view this combination makes very good strategic sense for both companies." 
Pepsi and Quaker spokesmen both declined to comment on any speculation, citing company policies. 
Shares of Quaker soared to a new high of $89-1/16 on Friday, a gain of $6.81, or more than 8 percent, from 
Thursday's close. The shares last traded at $88-3/4. Meanwhile, Pepsi shares skidded $2-5/16, almost 5 percent, 
to $44-3/4. The shares have since rebounded to $45-1/2. 
IS PEPSI WILLING TO PAY A PREMIUM? 
"What is in (PepsiCo Chairman and Chief Executive) Roger Enrico's mind is that he's very focused on making 
consensus forecasts, because Pepsi in the mid 1990s, for almost two years running, quarter after quarter, did not 
meet consensus forecasts," ING Barings analyst Emanuel Goldman said. 
The deal, if priced too high, could slash Pepsi's earnings potential over the near term. 
"On the other hand, you can't run your business for Wall Street," Goldman added. "They paid retail for Tropicana, 
but it was worth it," Goldman said of Pepsi's $3.3 billion purchase of Tropicana back in 1998. "Quality goods don't 
come cheap." 
Analysts clearly see Quaker, particularly the Gatorade franchise, as a great fit for Pepsi's burgeoning 
noncarbonated business. But they are not sure how high Pepsi should bid. 
"Fourteen billion probably is a fair price, and I don't want to see them pay much more than that," Levy said. "But 
I'm wondering if there's a way that they can pay more, but sell off an asset to bring it back down to the same 
price." 
Levy and others stressed that while Gatorade would be a key asset for Pepsi, Quaker's cereal brands and 
Rice-A-Roni, among other products, do not seem like matches for Pepsi, which garners about two-thirds of its 
profits from salty snacks.

Pepsi, in the No. 2 spot behind beverage behemoth Coca-Cola Co., has expanded its noncarbonated beverage 
line over the past few years. While carbonated beverages are still the mainstay of both company's drinks 
franchises, they are growing at a snail's pace compared to noncarbonated drinks. 
"The carbonated soft drink business in the U.S. has a retail value of about $58 billion, the sports drink business in 
comparison has a retail value of about $2.5 billion," said John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry 
newsletter. "But the noncarbonated areas of the business are growing much more strongly right now, so Pepsi 
and Coke are both basically moving into the non-carb business aggressively because they both want to be and 
both need to be total beverage companies." 
Pepsi's noncarbonated beverage line already includes Starbucks Frappuccino drinks, Lipton Brisk iced tea, 
Aquafina bottled water and FruitWorks. Most recently, Pepsi said it would scoop up a 90 percent stake in South 
Beach Beverage Co., maker of the SoBe line of new age drinks. Coca-Cola had been in months-long talks to buy 
a stake in SoBe. 
"This would clearly make Pepsi king of the noncarbonated market by a lot, no one else would even be close, no 
matter what Coke would do they wouldn't be able to catch up," Goldman said.

Quaker Oats Co. Spurns Takeover by PepsiCo

The Quaker Oats Co. rejected a $13.7 billion takeover bid from PepsiCo Inc. late Thursday, according to 
published reports, but the future independence of the Chicago-based food company remains in doubt. 
PepsiCo's attempt to snare the powerhouse Gatorade brand by acquiring Quaker appeared to have been aborted 
as the two sides failed to reach an agreement on price, according to Dow Jones News Service and The New York 
Times. 
The two sides had extensive discussions, and PepsiCo Thursday made what it called a final offer, proposing to 
exchange 2.2 of its shares for each share of Quaker, which would have valued Quaker at about $103.68 a share, 
or 26 percent above Thursday's closing price, The New York Times reported. Quaker Oats rejected that bid as 
too low. 
Roger Enrico, Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo's chairman and chief executive, refused to sweeten the company's 
bid, concerned that a higher offer would dilute PepsiCo earnings per share, Dow Jones reported. Enrico is 
believed to have been concerned about not damaging PepsiCo's credibility with Wall Street, where its stock has 
been a strong performer. 
Of course, the talks could be revived. At the same time, news of the talks is likely to cause rival food and 
beverage companies to try to engage Quaker in discussions. Nestle SA, Danone SA and Coca-Cola Co. are 
likely suitors for Quaker, but they would need to top what PepsiCo was willing to pay. 
A Quaker spokesman declined to comment. PepsiCo could not be reached for comment. 
Chicago-based Quaker has been one of the most attractive takeover targets in the food and beverage industries 
because of Gatorade. 
"I've always felt it was a matter of time before Quaker teamed up with a bigger company," said John McMillin, an 
analyst at Prudential Securities. "To cash in its chips now would not be a bad idea." 
Indeed, the food industry is in the midst of a consolidation drive that has ensnared several Chicago-area 
companies. 
Just last week, Keebler Foods Co., based in Elmhurst, agreed to be acquired by Kellogg Co. for $3.86 billion in 
cash. Earlier, Northfield-based Kraft Foods' parent, Philip Morris Cos., agreed to purchase Nabisco Holdings 
Corp. for $14.9 billion in stock. 
Shares of PepsiCo were down $1.56 in midmorning trading today on the New York Stock Exchange at $45.50, 
while Quaker shares were up $4.38 at $86.63. 
Quaker has been seen as the most obvious purchase by PepsiCo for some time because of the strength of 
Gatorade. The sports drink posted sales of $1.8 billion last year, up from $100 million in 1984 when Quaker 
acquired the brand. Despite repeated assaults by Coca-Cola's Powerade brand and PepsiCo's All-Sport, 
Gatorade commands more than 80 percent of the sports drink market and continues to grow. 
The major sticking points have been Quaker's slow-growing cereals business and the lofty price. PepsiCo has 
staked its future on higher-growth segments of the food and beverage industry.

PepsiCo Inc. attempted to snare the powerhouse Gatorade brand by acquiring Quaker Oats Co. for about $14 
billion in stock, but walked away last night when the two sides failed to reach an agreement on price, according to 
people familiar with the matter. 
PepsiCo made the initial overture to Quaker some time back, and the two sides had extensive discussions, going 
back and forth on price. PepsiCo yesterday made a "final" offer, proposing to exchange about 2.2 of its shares for 
each share of Quaker, these people say. 
Quaker Oats rejected that bid as too low, and Roger Enrico, PepsiCo's chairman and chief executive, refused to 
sweeten the company's bid, concerned that a higher offer would dilute PepsiCo's per-share earnings, a person 
familiar with the matter said. Mr. Enrico is believed to have been very concerned about not damaging Pepsi's 
credibility with Wall Street, where Pepsi stock has been a strong performer. 
News of the discussions was reported by The Wall Street Journal yesterday evening after the markets closed. At 
4 p.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, PepsiCo shares were down 94 cents to $47.06, 
which would have valued Quaker Oats at $103.53 a share, a 26% premium to Quaker Oats' closing price of 
$82.25 a share. 
Spokesmen for Pepsi, Purchase, N.Y., and Quaker, Chicago, declined to comment. 
To be sure, the talks could always be revived as negotiations are usually a game of chicken. However, there 
didn't appear to be any movement on either side last night. At the same time, news of the talks with Pepsi is likely 
to cause rival food and beverage companies to try to engage Quaker in discussions. 
Most analysts expect Quaker to be sold sooner rather than later. The U.S. food industry is rapidly consolidating, 
and Quaker Oats has long been considered the most attractive food company, precisely because of the strength 
of its nonfood business: Gatorade. Swiss giant Nestle SA and France's Danone SA, which both have large 
bottled-water businesses in the U.S., have missed out on the recent feeding frenzy among U.S. companies. At 
the same time, Coke would hate to see Gatorade slip away, though it would be hard-pressed to do a major 
acquisition since it is focused on reviving its core business. 
The problems for most rival suitors is that few companies want to be saddled with Quaker's slow-growth cereal 
business, so a soft-drink company with a strong distribution network has the best potential for synergies and 
increased sales. Furthermore, Pepsi's offer has now set a floor for what other bidders would need to pay. 
"One hundred dollars is a fair price," said John McMillin, an analyst at Prudential Securities. 
PepsiCo is "right to walk away," said Andrew Conway, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "If Pepsi had 
stretched the numbers well beyond $103, more questions would have been raised as to how Pepsi could 
accelerate the growth of Gatorade." 
The powerhouse sports drink had sales of $1.8 billion last year, up from a mere $100 million in 1984 when 
Quaker acquired the brand. Despite repeated assaults by Coca-Cola's Powerade brand and Pepsi's own 
All-Sport, Gatorade commands about 84% of the sports-drink market and continues to grow at a rapid clip. 
Quaker has been seen as the most obvious purchase by Pepsi for some time, but the sticking points have been 
the food business and the lofty price tag. Pepsi has staked its future on higher-growth segments of the food and

beverage industry. Quaker's beverage business accounts for almost half of its sales and operating profit, so the 
bulk of what Pepsi would have paid for would still be food products, ranging from the trademark Quaker oatmeal 
to Cap'n Crunch and Life cereal to Golden Grain and Rice-A-Roni. 
Both Quaker and Pepsi have engineered major turnarounds, returning to Wall Street's favor after huge 
disappointments a few years ago. Quaker hit its nadir in 1996, botching the acquisition of Snapple, which it 
bought for $1.7 billion in 1994 and ended up selling in 1997 for $300 million. At about the same time, Pepsi's 
restaurant business -- which then included the likes of Pizza Hut and Taco Bell -- was posting weak sales and its 
international beverage operations suffered embarrassing losses, forcing a major restructuring. 
Under Mr. Enrico, who took over in 1996, Pepsi has worked hard to transform itself from a diffuse organization 
into a company focused on snacks and nonalcoholic beverages. Mr. Enrico spun off the fast-food restaurant 
operations, took public its bottling business, and acquired Tropicana juices. Meanwhile, Robert Morrison, Quaker 
Oats' chief executive since late 1997, has gotten kudos from Wall Street for shedding some small food 
businesses and focusing the company on the beverage business, and extending the Gatorade brand with new 
flavors and brands. 
A purchase of Quaker would certainly have been expensive since Quaker's stock has risen 25% this year, giving 
it a market capitalization of $11.3 billion. On the other hand, Pepsi's stock has risen sharply as well, up 36% this 
year, giving it powerful currency for an acquisition. At the same time, Pepsi's biggest rival, Coca-Cola Co., has 
been preoccupied with a big corporate restructuring, following two years of weak earnings and the resignation last 
December of CEO M. Douglas Ivester. Earlier this week, Pepsi beat out Coke to buy South Beach Beverage Co., 
the hip marketer of New Age drinks. 
In the first six months of this year, Gatorade and Gatorade Frost had a commanding 83.6% of the U.S. 
"take-home" market, which covers sales through retail stores. Coca-Cola's Powerade brand had an 11% share, 
while All-Sport was at 3.1%, according to Beverage Digest, an industry publication. 
Despite Gatorade's dominance, analysts have long believed it could get a big boost if it were to be more readily 
available in vending machines and convenience stores, two strengths of the Pepsi -- and Coke -- distribution 
systems. 
William Pecoriello, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who has long predicted an acquisition of Quaker by Pepsi, 
wrote in a March 13 research note that Gatorade's volume could increase by 10% over five years by making the 
sports drink more available in Pepsi vending machines. Furthermore, Quaker Oats has long struggled with 
increasing Gatorade's overseas sales and a sale to Pepsi would allow it to tap into Pepsi's network of 
international bottlers. 
In the March note, Mr. Pecoriello said Gatorade would give Pepsi "the most attractive noncarbonated portfolio in 
the marketplace" at a time when consumers are shying away from fizzy drinks. Mr. Pecoriello and others have 
often said that Pepsi should make a joint bid with a company that would be willing to take Quaker's cereal 
business off its hands. While not impossible, such joint bids are difficult and can create tax complications.

Quaker snubs PepsiCo's 9.3bn pounds takeover offer 
Quaker snubs PepsiCo's 9.3bn pounds takeover offer

UNITED STATES cereal and soft drinks group Quaker Oats has rejected a takeover approach from PepsiCo 
after the drinks giant made a 9.3 billion offer. 
PepsiCo, which has long been interested in Quaker because of its successful Gatorade sports drink, had been 
talking about offering around two of its shares for each Quaker share, valuing the company at around 71 pounds 
per share. 
However, it is understood the bid was rejected at a meeting between the two companies last night. 
PepsiCo's approach came amid signs that the breakfast cereal and sports drink maker is ready to become the 
latest target of the consolidation in the US foods industry, with Quaker unlikely to continue as an independent 
company. 
Other consumer companies, including French group Danone and Swiss chocolate giant Nestle, are also thought 
to have expressed interest in buying Quaker. 
Industry observers said PepsiCo would have purchased Quaker Oats for its flagship beverage brand, Gatorade, 
which has an 80 per cent market share in the US. PepsiCo's own sports drink brand, Allsport, has seen its market 
share decline while Coca-Cola's Powerade has gained ground over the past two years. 
In 1999, Allsport had only a 4.2 per cent share of the US market, down from 6.7 per cent in 1998, and Powerade's 
market share was at 12.3 per cent in 1999, up from 11.6 per cent the year before. 
After years of stagnation, there has been a flurry of consolidation in the US food industry this year, including 
Unilever's takeover of Bestfoods, Kraft's acquisition of biscuit maker Nabisco and the purchase of Pillsbury by 
General Mills. And just last week, Kellogg snapped up Keebler for 2.6bn. 
Quaker Oats has been one of the best performers in the US food industry this year. Its shares have risen a 
quarter since January and are close to their recent all-time high. At yesterday's close of 58.75 pounds, the group 
is capitalised at around 8.1bn, and at the end of June, Quaker had around 357m of net debt. 
PepsiCo has done even better. Its stock has risen by a third this year due to strong results, lifting its market value 
to nearly 50bn. The group has also successfully integrated Tropicana, the juice company it bought for 2.4bn just 
over two years ago. 
The fit between the two companies appeared good. Though most famous for its cola, PepsiCo is one of the 
world's leading snack food makers, with brands like Doritos, Fritos and Cracker Jack. Its Frito- Lay subsidiary, 
which also owns Walkers crisps in the UK, will contribute around two-thirds of this year's forecast sales of 14bn 
and a similar proportion of profits. Pepsi accounts for a quarter of sales with Tropicana making up the remainder. 
Quaker Oats recently saw a 16 per cent jump in profits - thanks to high demand for its increasingly popular 
Gatorade sports drink. 
The Chicago-based food company said earnings rose to 109m for the last quarter, compared with 94.5m in the 
same period a year ago. 
Quaker said total sales over the period had risen to the 1.2bn mark. 
PepsiCo also recently announced a better-than-expected 21 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings, driven by 
double-digit gains at its snacks and juice businesses.

The New York-based company, which controls more than half of the US snack market and 30 per cent of its soft 
drink market, said profits rose to 375m from 311m a year earlier. 
PepsiCo chairman and chief executive Roger Enrico said the company's volume gains in the second quarter 
reflected the strength of the business.

Cadbury, Danone Seen as Possible White Knights For Quaker Oats 
Cadbury, Danone Seen as Possible White Knights For Quaker Oats

NEW YORK -- Because many of the logical U.S. suitors for Quaker Oats Co. are already occupied with 
large-scale food acquisitions, market watchers believe Cadbury Schweppes PLC and Groupe Danone SA could 
team up to bid for Quaker in the aftermath of an aborted PepsiCo Inc. bid for Quaker. 
Investors clearly expect someone to step forward. At 4 p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of 
Quaker (OAT) were up $7.38, or 9%, at $89.63. 
Cadbury (CSG), a United Kingdom beverage and confectionery group, and France's Danone could give Quaker 
more freedom to run its businesses than PepsiCo (PEP) would, fund managers and analysts said. 
David Liston, an analyst at Capel, Cure, Sharp, said Cadbury would be highly interested in Quaker's Gatorade 
sports drink business because market players are increasingly turning to non-carbonated drinks to fuel growth. 
Capel, Cure, Sharp is part of Old Mutual Group PLC, which has 20 billion pounds ($28.9 billion) under 
management, including a 2% stake in Cadbury, as well as a smaller stake in Danone. 
Switzerland-based Nestle SA, one of the largest food companies in the world, missed the boat on some of the 
food industry's earlier wave of acquisitions. But James Amoroso, head of Swiss research at Dresdner Kleinwort 
Benson, said a Nestle bid doesn't make sense because the firm has avoided soft drinks and cereals. Moreover, 
Nestle has a joint venture with General Mills Inc., which might even preclude a bid for a rival. 
PepsiCo was ready to offer about $14 billion in stock for the Chicago-based Quaker but walked away from talks 
late Thursday when the two sides failed to reach an agreement on price. PepsiCo was primarily interested in 
adding Quaker's fast-growing Gatorade business to its beverage stable. 
PepsiCo made an initial overture to Quaker some time back, and the two sides had extensive discussions, going 
back and forth on price. PepsiCo Thursday made a "final" offer, proposing to exchange about 2.2 of its shares for 
each share of Quaker. 
Quaker rejected that bid as too low, and Roger Enrico, PepsiCo's chairman and chief executive, refused to 
sweeten the company's bid, concerned that a higher offer would dilute PepsiCo's earnings, a person familiar with 
the matter said. Mr. Enrico is believed to have been very concerned about not damaging Pepsi's credibility with 
Wall Street, where Pepsi stock has been a strong performer. 
With an 80% share of the sports-beverage market, Gatorade has been described as arguably the most powerful 
beverage, if not the most influential packaged goods brand, in the U.S. What potential buyers find less savory is 
Quaker's food business, and more specifically, its stable of cereal products, which are far less profitable than 
Gatorade and have been battling decreasing volume in the face of higher prices. 
So while names like Coca-Cola Co. (KO), Kellogg Co. (K), General Mills (GIS), Philip Morris Cos. (MO) are being 
tossed around as possible suitors, questions remain as to whether these companies would actually want to take 
on Quaker's food assets. 
And Kellogg, Philip Morris and General Mills are already occupied with large acquisitions. "All the logical buyers 
are busy," said Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. analyst Skip Carpenter. 
Quaker's cereal business, made up of such well-known brands as Cap'n Crunch and Life, may raise antitrust 
concerns if another cereal maker were to make a bid. Philip Morris's Kraft Foods unit sells Post brand cereals. 
PepsiCo is still viwed as a good for Quaker because PepsiCo already sells the competing All-Sport beverage and 
owns Frito-Lay, one of the largest snack food companies in the U.S. PepsiCo could incorporate Quaker's

Page 145 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
faster-growing grain-based products like breakfast bars and perhaps jump start its struggling rice cake snack 
business. 
But it is highly unlikely PepsiCo would outbid itself, like Unilever NV did earlier this year when it struck a deal to 
buy Bestfoods. With no competing offer on the table, Unilever increased its own bid to secure the purchase. 
"Pepsi put its best offer out there," said Mr. Carpenter. Of course, one option for PepsiCo, he said, would be to 
team up with a third party that would take on some or all of Quaker's food operations and make a combined offer. 
Mr. Liston said that a combined Cadbury-Danone bid makes sense because the two teamed up to bid for Nabisco 
Holdings in June but lost to Philip Morris, which agreed to pay $18.9 billion. 
Another fund manager with significant stakes in Cadbury and Danone said a joint bid would be driven primarily by 
the French food group, because Danone has been "itching" for a deal. He said Cadbury, which recently bought 
Snapple and is eyeing Pernod-Ricard's Orangina brand, may decide it wants to focus more on confectionary, its 
other key division, rather than add another beverage. 
Cadbury last month completed a $1 billion acquisition of Snapple Beverage Group from Triarc Cos. Cadbury is 
also assuming $420 million in debt and will pay about $120 million for options held by Snapple employees. 
Snapple, known for its flavored tea drinks, fits in with Cadbury's Motts, Dr. Pepper and 7-Up distribution network. 
Danone, meanwhile, is reportedly keen to expand its lifestyle products, fresh dairy, water and biscuits divisions. 
"Danone would be interested in the snacks and convenience foods -- the fast breakfast element, which is high 
margin and high growth," the fund manager said. 
Oliver Lebrun, an analyst with Natexis Capital in Paris, said that in order to bid, Danone would need a partner: 
most likely Cadbury or PepsiCo. 
But Cadbury may scrap a bid if management feels the high price would stretch resources or unnerve investors 
who have watched the group invest heavily in beverages, but not its confectionary business.

NEW YORK -- PepsiCo Inc. attempted to snare the powerhouse Gatorade brand by acquiring Quaker Oats Co. 
for about $14 billion in stock, but walked away Thursday night when the two sides failed to reach an agreement 
on price, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. 
PepsiCo (PEP) made the initial overture to Quaker (OAT) some time back, and the two sides had extensive

sweeten the company's bid, concerned that a higher offer would dilute PepsiCo's per-share earnings, a person 
familiar with the matter said. Mr. Enrico is believed to have been very concerned about not damaging Pepsi's 
credibility with Wall Street, where Pepsi stock has been a strong performer. 
News of the discussions was reported by the Journal Thursday evening after the markets closed. At 4 p.m. in 
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, PepsiCo shares were down 94 cents to $47.06, which would 
have valued Quaker Oats at $103.53 a share, a 26% premium to Quaker Oats' closing price of $82.25 a share. 
Spokesmen for Pepsi, Purchase, N.Y., and Quaker, Chicago, declined to comment. 
The talks could always be revived. However, there didn't appear to be any movement on either side Thursday 
night. News of the talks with Pepsi is likely to cause rival food and beverage companies to try to engage Quaker 
in discussions. 
Most analysts expect Quaker to be sold sooner rather than later. The U.S. food industry is rapidly consolidating, 
and Quaker Oats has long been considered the most attractive food company, precisely because of the strength 
of its nonfood business: Gatorade. Swiss giant Nestle SA and France's Danone SA, which both have large 
bottled-water businesses in the U.S., have missed out on the recent feeding frenzy among U.S. companies. At 
the same time, Coke would hate to see Gatorade slip away, though it would be hard-pressed to do a major 
acquisition since it is focused on reviving its core business. 
The problems for most rival suitors is that few companies want to be saddled with Quaker's slow-growth cereal 
business, so a soft-drink company with a strong distribution network has the best potential for synergies and 
increased sales. Furthermore, Pepsi's offer has now set a floor for what other bidders would need to pay. 
Gatorade had sales of $1.8 billion last year, up from a mere $100 million in 1984 when Quaker acquired the 
brand. Despite repeated assaults by Coca-Cola's Powerade brand and Pepsi's own All-Sport, Gatorade 
commands about 84% of the sports-drink market and continues to grow at a rapid clip. 
Quaker has been seen as the most obvious purchase by Pepsi for some time, but the sticking points have been 
the food business and the lofty price tag. Pepsi has staked its future on higher-growth segments of the food and 
beverage industry. Quaker's beverage business accounts for almost half of its sales and operating profit, so the 
bulk of what Pepsi would have paid for would still be food products, ranging from the trademark Quaker oatmeal 
to Cap'n Crunch and Life cereal to Golden Grain and Rice-A-Roni.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) has been holding high-level talks to acquire Quaker Oats Co. 
(OAT) for about $13 billion in stock, a move that would put the powerhouse Gatorade brands in its arsenal, say 
people familiar with the matter. 
The talks are fluid and could fall apart at any time, these people warned. Pepsi has eyed Quaker for years and 
the chances of the two sides striking a deal "are about 50-50 at this point," one person familiar with the matter 
warned. A crucial meeting on whether to go ahead was expected Thursday evening. 
Furthermore, Quaker could easily flirt with other suitors. The Chicago-based food and beverage company would 
be a tempting target for European companies. Swiss giant Nestle SA and France?s Danone SA, which have large 
bottled water businesses in the U.S., have missed out on the recent feeding frenzy among U.S. companies and 
could be anxious to make a move. At the same time, Coca-Cola Co. (KO) would hate to see Gatorade slip into 
the arms of its arch-rival and could team up with Nestle, with whom it has close relations, to beat Pepsi to the 
punch. 
PepsiCo is believed to have offered slightly more than two of its shares for each share of Quaker, which would 
value Quaker at close to $100 a share. As of Thursday, it wasn?t clear if Quaker would find that exchange ratio 
acceptable. The two sides were continuing to negotiate. 
At 4 p.m. trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of PepsiCo were down 94 cents to $47.06 while 
Quaker shares were unchanged at $82.25. 
PepsiCo, based in Purchase, and Quaker, Chicago, declined to comment. 
The U.S. food industry is rapidly consolidating and Quaker Oats has long been considered the most attractive 
food company, precisely because of the strength of its non-food business, Gatorade. The powerhouse sports 
drink has posted sales of $1.8 billion last year, up from $100 million in 1984 when Quaker acquired the brand. 
Despite repeated assaults by Coca-Cola?s Powerade brand and Pepsi?s All-Sport, Gatorade commands more 
than 80% of the sports drink market and continues to grow at a rapid clip. 
Quaker has been seen as the most obvious purchase by Pepsi for some time. The major sticking points have 
been Quaker?s slow-growing cereal business and the lofty price. PepsiCo has staked its future on higher-growth 
segments of the food and beverage industry. As such, the company would love to get its hands on Gatorade and 
even likes Quaker?s grain-based snacks, which could be marketed through Frito-Lay?s well-regarded distribution 
system. But Quaker?s beverage business accounts for about 45% of sales and operating income, so the bulk of 
the business is still food products, from the trademark Quaker oatmeal to Cap?n Crunch and Life Cereal to 
Golden Grain and Rice-A-Roni. 
A purchase of Quaker would certainly be pricey since Quaker?s stock has risen 25% this year, giving it a market 
capitalization of $11.3 billion. On the other hand, PepsiCo?s stock has risen sharply as well, up 36% this year. 
Pepsi trades at about 29 times next year's earnings, while Quaker trades at more like 22 times earnings, giving 
Pepsi the financial wherewithal to make the acquisition. Depending on the price and the potential for cost savings, 
the deal could hurt Pepsi?s earnings, potentially upsetting Pepsi investors who have escaped the carnage of 
other consumer-products companies who have stumbled as a result of weak earnings or bad acquisitions.

That said, many analysts have said a Quaker deal would be a good fit for PepsiCo. Both Quaker and PepsiCo 
have engineered major turnarounds, returning to Wall Street?s favor after huge disappointments a few years ago. 
Quaker hit its nadir in 1996, botching the acquisition of Snapple, forcing it the following year to sell the brand for 
$300 million, $1.4 billion less than what it paid in 1994. At about the same time, PepsiCo?s restaurant business 
was hitting weak sales and its international operations suffered embarrassing losses, forcing a major 
restructuring. 
Under Roger Enrico, who took over in 1996, PepsiCo has worked hard to transform itself from a diffuse 
organization into a company focused on snacks and nonalcoholic beverages. 
Enrico spun off the fast-food restaurant operations, took public its bottling business and acquired Tropicana 
juices. Indeed, the success of the Tropicana deal, which initially was viewed skeptically because of the high price, 
may have emboldened PepsiCo to act now to buy Quaker. Not only has Tropicana performed well, analysts say it 
has given Pepsi access to Tropicana?s research on "functional" beverages. 
Meanwhile, Robert Morrison, Quaker Oats CEO since late 1997, has gotten kudos from Wall Street for shedding 
some small food businesses and focusing the company on the beverage business, and extending the Gatorade 
brand with new flavors and brands. The company has been introducing a new fitness water, called Propel, in 
select markets. Quaker has also leveraged the Gatorade brand by introducing energy bars. 
Executives at Pepsi, Coke and other companies have always kicked themselves for not buying Gatorade and 
Snapple when the two brands were being sold as a package deal ? for a much cheaper price - by Quaker Oats in 
the midst of Snapple?s woes. 
Aside from the strategic fit, one reason Pepsi may be attracted now is fear that someone else will swoop in to buy 
Quaker if it tarries too long. Pepsi?s timing may be fortuitous. Aside from Pepsi?s resurgent stock price, rival 
Coke is pre-occupied with a big corporate restructuring, following two years of weak earnings and the resignation 
last December of CEO M. Douglas Ivester. Pepsi just this week beat out Coke to buy South Beach Beverage Co., 
the hip marketer of New Age drinks. 
In a research note earlier this week, Andrew Lazar, an analyst at Lehman Brothers wrote that the SoBe deal and 
the recent sale of Snapple to Cadbury Schweppes PLC not only reduces "the availability of well-known, functional 
noncarbonated beverage assets, but should also once again raise the specter of a future Gatorade deal." 
In the first six months of this year, Gatorade and Gatorade Frost had a commanding 83.6% of the U.S. 
"take-home" market, which covers retail stores. Coca-Cola?s Powerade brand had an 11% share, while All-Sport 
was at 3.1%, according to Beverage Digest, an industry publication. 
Pepsi would almost certainly discontinue All-Sport to win antitrust approval of a deal. That shouldn?t be much of 
an issue since top executives have for some time privately talked about dropping the brand because of weak 
sales. Indeed, analysts have always thought a Coke purchase of Gatorade was more problematic because Coke 
has been very public in its commitment to the Powerade brand. 
Despite Gatorade?s dominance, analysts have long believed it could get a big boost if it were to be more readily 
available in vending machines and convenience stores, two strengths of the Pepsi and Coke distribution systems. 
William Pecoriello, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who has long predicted an acquisition of Quaker by 
PepsiCo, wrote in a March 13th research note Gatorade?s volume could increase by 10% over over five years by 
making Gatorade more available in Pepsi vending machines. Furthermore, Quaker Oats has long struggled with 
increasing Gatorade?s overseas sales and a sale to Pepsi would allow it to tap into the Pepsi?s network of 
international bottlers. 
In the note last March, Pecoriello said Gatorade would give Pepsi "the most attractive non-carbonated portfolio in 
the marketplace" at a time when consumers are shying away from fizzy drinks. Pecoriello and others have often 
believed that PepsiCo should make a joint bid with a company that would be willing to take Quaker?s cereal 
business off its hands. But such joint bids are difficult and can create tax complications.

Chipping Away: Coca-Cola could learn a thing or two from the renaissance at PepsiCo 
Chipping Away: Coca-Cola could learn a thing or two from the renaissance at PepsiCo

Corrections & Amplifications 
The Pepsi-Cola division accounted for 28% of PepsiCo's 1999 pro forma segment operating earnings. The 
number was misstated in the text of last week's story on PepsiCo. (Barron's June 19, 2000) 
As the scrappy No. 2 in the global beverage business, PepsiCo has spent much of its corporate life in 
Coca-Cola's enveloping shadow. After all, despite Pepsi's pit-bull tenacity and legendary marketing prowess, 
Coke still is "it" in market share, commanding 44% of the U.S. soft-drink market, compared with Pepsi's 31%. 
Worldwide, the gap is even wider: Coke's share exceeds 50%, while Pepsi's is around 20%. 
This year, however, Coke is on the ropes, its shares battered by a string of earnings disappointments and 
suspicions that the American icon has irrevocably lost its way. Pepsi, meanwhile, is firing on almost all cylinders, 
and winning long-sought plaudits on Wall Street even as its growing stable of snack foods and beverages finds 
new fans on Main. 
Bolstered by its Frito-Lay snack chips division, and the 1998 purchase of Tropicana, PepsiCo last year posted pro 
forma net income from operations of $1.85 billion, or $1.24 a share, reflecting a gain of 11%. (Pro forma numbers 
exclude one-time items, and treat the August 1998 acquisition of Tropicana as though it occurred at the start of 
that year.) Conversely, Coke's '99 earnings from operations slipped roughly 10%, to $3.2 billion, or $1.29 a share. 
After losing ground for much of 1999 -- a common affliction among consumer issues -- Pepsi's shares, too, have 
recovered. So far this year, they're up 19%, to around $41, handily beating all of the market's key measures. 
Coke's shares, alas, have continued to tumble, backtracking 9% to the vicinity of $52. 
Nor do analysts and investors think Pepsi's pleasant ride is over. Caroline Levy, of UBS Warburg, for one, 
recently raised her target stock price to $51. At that level, Pepsi would fetch a multiple of 36 times this year's 
estimated earnings of $1.41 a share, and 32 times next year's consensus estimate of $1.58. Coke, which 
historically has traded at a fat premium to its archrival, currently sells for 36 times 2000 estimates of $1.44, and 
29 times 2001 estimates of $1.77. 
Surely, the irony of their role reversal can't be lost on the folks in Atlanta, nor on their proud counterparts in 
Purchase, New York, where PepsiCo occupies a little piece of paradise off the Hutchinson River Parkway in 
Westchester County. "I'm happy to see the market is discriminating between us and them," says PepsiCo 
Chairman and Chief Executive Roger Enrico, whose spacious office looks out upon a particularly lovely swath of 
the company's verdant, sculpture-studded campus. 
Just the same, Pepsi feels Coke's pain. "We've been there, done that," Enrico adds quickly, alluding to Coke's 
longtime quest for market share at the expense of sound investments. In Coke's defense, the company won at 
least half the battle, planting its flag firmly across the globe before its profligate spending habits came home to 
roost. PepsiCo not only lost a bundle over the years in dubious overseas ventures, but has seen its domestic 
reach stagnate in its flagship brand. 
It would be premature, if not foolhardy, to count Coca-Cola out at this juncture, especially since Douglas Daft, the 
company's new chairman, already is taking concrete steps to turn Big Red around. But it would be equally unwise 
to bet that Pepsi will linger much longer in Coke's shadow. Coke and Pepsi may be lumped together by investors, 
covered by the same beverage analysts, and considered dueling peas in a pod by the public. But PepsiCo's

Page 150 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
wrenching transformation since 1996 -- necessitated by its past transgressions -- has put the cola kings on 
sharply divergent paths. 
Coke, for its part, has hewed to the tried, true and, in most years, hugely profitable formula of making concentrate 
and selling it to a controlled network of bottlers, in the U.S. and, increasingly, abroad. PepsiCo, on the other hand, 
still intends to wage the good fight in soft drinks, but has placed most of its chips on, yes, those of the corn and 
potato persuasion. 
Under Enrico's stewardship, now in its fifth year, the company has spun off its cash-intensive fast-food operations 
into Tricon Global Restaurants, and sold some 60% of Pepsi Bottling Group, its largest bottler, to the public. 
Although PepsiCo is still the name on the door, Frito-Lay last year chipped in 62% of pro forma net sales of $18.7 
billion, and 66% of pro forma segment operating profits of $3 billion. (These profits don't include corporate 
expenses.) 
The Pepsi-Cola division, which now includes a booming business in alternative beverages, such as bottled water 
and tea, accounted for only $4.8 billion, or 26% of '99 sales, and $859 million, or 2% of operating earnings. 
Tropicana, the new kid on the block, made up the rest: $2.3 billion, or 12% of sales, and $170 million, or 6% of 
segment profits. 
Nor have the changes at PepsiCo been purely structural in nature. Enrico, who signed off on an ugly $822 million 
writeoff of international beverage and restaurant assets in 1996, also has overhauled Pepsi's free-wheeling 
corporate culture in ways that Coke would do well to study, if not emulate. To begin with, he called a halt to the 
game of executive musical chairs, extending the length of typical field assignments to three years from under two. 
"We had almost a sickness here, where you had to change jobs every 18 months or you were considered a 
loser," recalls Vice Chairman Karl von der Heyden, a onetime Pepsi executive whom Enrico plucked from 
retirement to map out and help direct the company's overhaul. The shift in personnel policies not only cured the 
disease but lowered expenses and provided much-needed continuity for PepsiCo's worldwide endeavors. 
More important, Pepsi took a hard look at how it generated and managed cash, a resource that arguably hadn't 
been treated with sufficiently deserving respect, perhaps because of its historic abundance. In the past, division 
heads were held to profit- and sales-growth targets, notes Indra Nooyi, Pepsi's chief financial officer and onetime 
chief strategist. But none save the CEO had accountability for cash returns. 
Along with pushing cash-flow responsibility down the line, the tough but wry von der Heyden, then serving as 
CFO, took a very unPepsi-like stance toward checkbook management. If you spent your alloted pot of change, 
Big Daddy no longer blithely wrote overdraft privileges. At the same time, Pepsi moved merger and acquisition 
decisions to the corporate level, standardizing its vetting procedures. 
Lastly, Enrico raised the stature of share buybacks, a practice investors have praised. From 1997 through last 
year, the company spent $6 billion to repurchase 164 million shares. This year, Pepsi already has shelled out at 
least $700 million or so, as part of a three-year, $3 billion buyback program ending in 2001. 
PepsiCo's new-found religion in matters financial (Nooyi calls it a judicious blend of "fiscal restraint, on the one 
hand, and prudent growth on the other") has yielded enviable results. Total revenues have declined by roughly a 
third since '96, but profits from ongoing operations have fallen less than 20%. Pro forma operating margins have 
shot up to 15%, from 10%; free cash flow after capital expenditures remained around $2 billion, and return on 
invested capital has increased by a third, to 20%. The company's balance sheet has been equally profoundly 
impacted. With the restaurant operations and most of Pepsi Bottling gone, long-term debt has dropped to $2.8 
billion from $8.2 billion in '96. 
After years of erratic performance, Enrico and his top lieutenants -- primarily PepsiCo president Steve 
Reinemund, Nooyi and van der Heyden -- now expect to expand revenues by 6%-7% annually, largely through 
volume increases. This would translate into gains of 10%-11% in operating profit. "We're in the sweet spot of the 
food and beverage business," a confident Nooyi says. "Meals are out, grazing is in." 
The company thinks it can get another one to three percentage points of lift from share buybacks, tighter expense 
controls, and higher returns on invested capital, bringing the long-term sustainable growth rate in annual earnings 
per share to 12%-13%. Such goals might seem, well, a tad boring in today's loopy market, but Pepsi's ability to 
deliver like clockwork would be anything but. Besides, the ranks of those who will settle for this brand of boredom 
seem to be growing with each hairpin turn of the Nasdaq.

While the recent pop in Pepsi's stock owes in part to the market's renewed interest in Old Economy issues (not 
that sector-rotation has put the fizz back in Coke), give Enrico, the master marketer, his due. This year, the 
seasoned cola warrior has turned road warrior, too, traversing the land to talk up Pepsi's brightening prospects 
with the company's biggest investors. His message is unequivocal: Pepsi's recovery is no flash in the pan, and its 
stock deserves to trade at the premium price/earnings multiples historically accorded other blue-chip consumer 
issues such as Coke, Gillette, Colgate Palmolive, Procter & Gamble and Estee Lauder. 
"He should be careful what he asks for when some of those companies' multiples are in free fall," says David 
Carlson, a portfolio manager at GE Asset Management, who recently brought a team to Purchase to meet with 
Pepsi's top brass. All kidding aside, though, Carlson likes the story. "The changes at Pepsi are fairly profound, 
and they are somewhat underappreciated by investors," he says. 
Tom Cole, a senior analyst at Brinson Partners, in Chicago, agrees. "We still see a lot of value in the stock," says 
Cole, who is awaiting his own Enrico visit. "The company's fundamentals are intact, and there is every indication 
that analysts' estimates are rising." Cole also applauds Reinemund's promotion last year to the posts of president 
and chief operating officer, a move that would seem to position the former Frito-Lay chief to someday succeed 
Enrico, now 55. 
"If there's such a thing as an heir-apparent, he's as apparent as there is," Enrico quips. "The man knows how to 
lead a team and get results." 
Reinemund firmly refused to comment on how, or whether, he might one day lead Pepsi. In any case, the 
company's current chief has plenty of work left to do. As Enrico warms to the topic of PepsiCo's transformation, 
he slides so far forward in his chair that his knees nearly touch the floor. It is a perfect supplicating stance for 
someone used to selling products that nobody, technically, needs. Yet the ever-animated 29-year PepsiCo 
veteran need not apologize for his team's achievements. Judging by the numbers, Pepsi has done a fine job not 
just cleaning its cupboards, but convincing the public that soft drinks and chips are two of the five major food 
groups. 
For openers, Frito-Lay ships more than half of the nation's snack chips, and boasts 40% of the category's global 
volume. Tropicana is No. 1 both here and abroad in sales of chilled branded juice. Not to be outdone, Pepsi's 
Aquafina is the best-selling brand of non-jug bottled water in the U.S. -- and that's before a national campaign that 
kicked off this spring. The company's Mountain Dew soda, meanwhile, was last year's volume-growth leader in 
U.S. carbonated soft drinks, according to Beverage Digest/Maxwell, an industry score-keeper. 
The public's apparent affection for Pepsi's products is mirrored by that of the nation's grocers. PepsiCo is No. 2 in 
U.S. supermarket sales of branded products, behind only Philip Morris. Thanks to its vaunted direct-store-delivery 
system, which depends on company drivers, not store employees, to restock and merchandise shelves, Pepsi is 
the single greatest source of supermarket profits. And because its products typically turn over five or six times a 
month, before the retailer has to pay, the company generates about 20% of the average store's cash flow. 
For the past three years, Pepsi has been revamping its DSD system to boost its own cash flow. Previously the 
trucks had been much like rolling warehouses, in which drivers rummaged around each day for the needed goods 
with which to plug holes on supermarket shelves. With the help of industrial engineering, trucks now are 
prepacked based on store needs and drivers' routes. This practice increases the trucks' capacity, as drivers no 
longer need a "crawl space" to gather up their orders. In so doing, it dramatically increases the number of 
stockkeeping units, or SKUs, that each truck can carry. 
The last point is crucial, given Pepsi's reliance on additional new products to grow. Enrico doesn't mince words. "If 
we don't innovate we will atrophy," he declares. "In the salty snacks business, especially in the U.S., the amount 
of product news we generate in any given year is correlated to the amount of sales growth in the category." At 
Frito-Lay, Nooyi adds, new products introduced since 1995 now account for 35% of profits. 
Much of Pepsi's new-product development historically has relied on variations on successful themes, and that 
practice will continue. "Another flavor of Doritos does very well, thank you," Enrico says. 
But Pepsi's chairman believes the company has been too inwardly focused in its innovation efforts, and he 
expects "tuckin" acquisitions, joint ventures and other corporate alliances, both here and abroad, to play a greater 
role in future growth. If Pepsi is smart and lucky, most will look like Cracker Jacks, which the company picked up 
from Borden for two times sales -- the brand had no earnings -- in 1998. Once "Pepsitized" -- the line was honed, 
the product tweaked and the bags and boxes run through Pepsi's distribution network -- Cracker Jacks doubled 
its annual sales to $100 million.

Pepsi has been cited more than once this spring as a possible bidder for Nabisco Group Holdings, which was put 
in play by financier Carl Icahn. Several European food giants are circling the cookie-maker, but Enrico's steering 
clear. "If we're going to add a fourth leg to PepsiCo, I want to make sure it's got our growth dynamics," he says. "I 
don't think the cookie and biscuit business does. We've thought about and watched the company a lot, but 
concluded we'd be looking at dilution near-term, and not adding long-term to our ability to grow." 
That said, Enrico is shrewd enough to leave himself an out. "It's a `no' unless someone waltzes in here and 
shows us a great way to do the deal that we'd never dreamed of," he says. 
Many Pepsi fans think Frito-Lay International could be the company's biggest growth engine, given rising 
disposable income and disproportionately low snackfood consumption abroad. Last year, the unit's $3.75 billion in 
sales and $406 million in operating profits were restrained by economic problems in Brazil, but this year's stellar 
first-quarter results shed greater light on the potential for the business. Powered by Sabrita's, Mexico's largest 
snack-food company, and Walker's, Pepsi's salty-snacks business in the United Kingdom, Frito-Lay 
International's operating profits surged 27%, to $99 million, while sales rose 17%, to $918 million. 
If investors deem Frito-Lay PepsiCo's crown jewel, they're a bit more skeptical, and rightly so, about its 
Pepsi-Cola division. Last year, total carbonated softdrink volume grew a scant 0.5% in the U.S., as outsized price 
hikes of 6%-7% notably curbed sales. By this year's second half, however, most industry observers, PepsiCo 
included, expect growth to rebound to historic levels of around 3%. "Price wars had driven soda prices down to 
the point where bottlers couldn't get a decent return on supermarket sales," says Pepsi's von der Heyden. "While 
there is some room left to raise prices, at least in step with inflation, I would rather see a reduction in the 
frequency of promotions." 
Ironically, von der Heyden's wish could prove prophetic, chiefly because of Coca-Cola's journey back to health. 
"The changes that seem to be coming about at Coke are also positive for us," Enrico explains. "Sometimes in the 
past, we had to go down a blind alley because the competition took us there. When Coke gets stronger, we'll 
have an opportunity to compete in a more financially disciplined way, on a more level playing field." 
Lowering the temperature seems altogether sensible to Brinson's Tom Cole, the firm's beverage expert. "Coke's 
growth is coming internationally, and Pepsi's is coming from Frito-Lay," he says. "It is in the companies' mutual 
best interest not to destroy the domestic market and eat up each other's share." 
Pepsi might even have a competitive advantage through its second-hand influence in the fountain market. For 
many years, Coke made great hay of PepsiCo's restaurant interests (Pepsi owned Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and 
KFC), loudly urging potential fountain customers not to buy concentrate from their restaurant rival. With the Tricon 
spinoff, Pepsi redoubled its efforts in fountain sales, although it failed to win big contracts from chains such as 
Burger King and Wendy's. Yet its aggressive bidding is thought to have lowered victor Coke's margins 
significantly. 
"For years, Coca-Cola had a free ride in the fountain business, which it used to pressure Pepsi," says Bill 
Pecoriello, Sanford C. Bernstein's noted beverage analyst. Now, he implies, Pepsi's indirectly exerting a little 
pressure of its own. 
Overseas, however, Pepsi-Cola has been taking a markedly different tack. Chastened by experience, the 
company is less intent on butting head with Coke where the latter has a seeming stranglehold on the business. 
Pepsi has divided its international beverage opportunities into three distinct segments. "We're going to play in the 
first leagues in countries where we're either No. 1 or a strong No. 2," Enrico says. "These countries account for 
about half our overseas volume." 
In countries where Pepsi doesn't have "scale" -- about 100, in all -- the company is aligning with local bottlers. But 
in the third group of nations, which includes India and China, Pepsi-Cola's boldly staking its claim. "Political 
changes that have occurred since 1990 have given us access to huge numbers of people in economies that are 
expected to grow faster than global GDP, irrespective of who has a head start," says Enrico. 
Pepsi's been spending money to build up its brand in these emerging markets, and Enrico admits these 
investments are "probably our biggest P&L hit." Last year Pepsi-Cola International reported operating profits of 
$108 million on sales of $1.8 billion, resulting in slender margins of 6%. Building out its international beverage 
business, after a series of wipeouts in the 1990s, will require a delicate balancing act. 
Pepsi has deftly hedged its bets in the slow-growing cola market with an increasingly diverse stable of carb and 
non-carb beverages. In recent years, high-caloric, citrus-flavored Mountain Dew -- a favorite with teenage boys

brand has been on PepsiCo's shelf since the 'Sixties. Last year, "Dew" climbed to No. 4 in U.S. carbonated 
soft-drink volume, behind Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola and Diet Coke, with a 7.1% market share. 
Where Pepsi shines lately, however, is in the non-bubbly stuff. Its eclectic alternative lineup, which includes 
bottled water, ready-to-drink teas (through a joint venture with Unilever's Lipton), bottled coffee (Starbucks' 
Frappuccino) and a new fruit juice last year boasted volume growth of 17%, well above the industry average. 
Neither Pepsi nor Coke have made a perceptible dent in the sportsdrink category, although Bill Pecoriello, of 
Bernstein, argued in a recent report that PepsiCo could do wonders with Quaker Oats' Gatorade if it bought 
Quaker and then shed that company's food operations. But his thesis fell short on several key counts: Quaker's 
not selling, and Pepsi would never cotton to a hugely dilutive purchase. 
Two years ago, Seagram put its Tropicana division on the market, and PepsiCo, spotting a winner, quickly 
snapped up the brand for $3.3 billion. Largely by adding vitamins and calcium, Pepsi has pumped up Tropicana's 
sales and established a beachhead in the growing nutritional market. Reinemund considers Tropicana a 
"tremendous opportunity," and Pepsi is studying ways to expand distribution beyond the brand's Northeast 
stronghold. Tropicana's margins, however, are considerably lower than Pepsi-Cola's and FritoLay's. In '99, the 
division generated pro forma operating margins of 7.5%-not exactly shabby, but far from Frito's and Pepsi-Cola's 
17%-18%. 
So far, Wall Street is buying Enrico's upbeat talk, mostly because the company's quarterly numbers back his 
assertions. To be sure, Pepsi has its work cut out for it: putting the joy back in cola, and maneuvering carefully as 
it ramps up growth overseas. Happily, though, management's favorite phrase seems to be "institutional memory." 
Even Nooyi invokes it frequently, and she's been on board only six years. So long as Pepsi remembers its past 
transgressions, and not just its storied successes, the company likely will steer clear of trouble, keeping its 
shareholders happy. 
Coke, take note.

BARRON'S: Chipping Away: Coca-Cola Could Learn A Thing Or Two From The Renaissance At PepsiCo 
BARRON'S: Chipping Away: Coca-Cola Could Learn A Thing Or Two From The Renaissance At PepsiCo

As the scrappy No. 2 in the global beverage business, PepsiCo has spent much of its corporate life in 
Coca-Cola's enveloping shadow. After all, despite Pepsi's pit-bull tenacity and legendary marketing prowess, 
Coke still is "it" in market share, commanding 44% of the U.S. soft-drink market, compared with Pepsi's 31%. 
Worldwide, the gap is even wider: Coke's share exceeds 50%, while Pepsi's is around 20%. 
This year, however, Coke is on the ropes, its shares battered by a string of earnings disappointments and 
suspicions that the American icon has irrevocably lost its way. Pepsi, meanwhile, is firing on almost all cylinders, 
and winning long-sought plaudits on Wall Street even as its growing stable of snack foods and beverages finds 
new fans on Main. 
Bolstered by its Frito-Lay snack chips division, and the 1998 purchase of Tropicana, PepsiCo last year posted pro 
forma net income from operations of $1.85 billion, or $1.24 a share, reflecting a gain of 11%. (Pro forma numbers 
exclude one-time items, and treat the August 1998 acquisition of Tropicana as though it occurred at the start of 
that year.) Conversely, Coke's '99 earnings from operations slipped roughly 10%, to $3.2 billion, or $1.29 a share. 
After losing ground for much of 1999 -- a common affliction among consumer issues -- Pepsi's shares, too, have 
recovered. So far this year, they're up 19%, to around $41, handily beating all of the market's key measures. 
Coke's shares, alas, have continued to tumble, backtracking 9% to the vicinity of $52. 
Nor do analysts and investors think Pepsi's pleasant ride is over. Caroline Levy, of UBS Warburg, for one, 
recently raised her target stock price to $51. At that level, Pepsi would fetch a multiple of 36 times this year's 
estimated earnings of $1.41 a share, and 32 times next year's consensus estimate of $1.58. Coke, which 
historically has traded at a fat premium to its archrival, currently sells for 36 times 2000 estimates of $1.44, and 
29 times 2001 estimates of $1.77. 
Surely, the irony of their role reversal can't be lost on the folks in Atlanta, nor on their proud counterparts in 
Purchase, New York, where PepsiCo occupies a little piece of paradise off the Hutchinson River Parkway in 
Westchester County. "I'm happy to see the market is discriminating between us and them," says PepsiCo 
Chairman and Chief Executive Roger Enrico, whose spacious office looks out upon a particularly lovely swath of 
the company's verdant, sculpture-studded campus. 
Just the same, Pepsi feels Coke's pain. "We've been there, done that," Enrico adds quickly, alluding to Coke's 
longtime quest for market share at the expense of sound investments. In Coke's defense, the company won at 
least half the battle, planting its flag firmly across the globe before its profligate spending habits came home to 
roost. PepsiCo not only lost a bundle over the years in dubious overseas ventures, but has seen its domestic 
reach stagnate in its flagship brand. 
It would be premature, if not foolhardy, to count Coca-Cola out at this juncture, especially since Douglas Daft, the 
company's new chairman, already is taking concrete steps to turn Big Red around. But it would be equally unwise 
to bet that Pepsi will linger much longer in Coke's shadow. Coke and Pepsi may be lumped together by investors, 
covered by the same beverage analysts, and considered dueling peas in a pod by the public. But PepsiCo's 
wrenching transformation since 1996 -- necessitated by its past transgressions -- has put the cola kings on 
sharply divergent paths. 
Coke, for its part, has hewed to the tried, true and, in most years, hugely profitable formula of making concentrate 
and selling it to a controlled network of bottlers, in the U.S. and, increasingly, abroad. PepsiCo, on the other hand, 
still intends to wage the good fight in soft drinks, but has placed most of its chips on, yes, those of the corn and 
potato persuasion.

Under Enrico's stewardship, now in its fifth year, the company has spun off its cash-intensive fast-food operations 
into Tricon Global Restaurants, and sold some 60% of Pepsi Bottling Group, its largest bottler, to the public. 
Although PepsiCo is still the name on the door, Frito-Lay last year chipped in 62% of pro forma net sales of $18.7 
billion, and 66% of pro forma segment operating profits of $3 billion. (These profits don't include corporate 
expenses.) 
The Pepsi-Cola division, which now includes a booming business in alternative beverages, such as bottled water 
and tea, accounted for only $4.8 billion, or 26% of '99 sales, and $859 million, or 2% of operating earnings. 
Tropicana, the new kid on the block, made up the rest: $2.3 billion, or 12% of sales, and $170 million, or 6% of 
segment profits. 
Nor have the changes at PepsiCo been purely structural in nature. Enrico, who signed off on an ugly $822 million 
writeoff of international beverage and restaurant assets in 1996, also has overhauled Pepsi's free-wheeling 
corporate culture in ways that Coke would do well to study, if not emulate. To begin with, he called a halt to the 
game of executive musical chairs, extending the length of typical field assignments to three years from under two. 
"We had almost a sickness here, where you had to change jobs every 18 months or you were considered a 
loser," recalls Vice Chairman Karl von der Heyden, a onetime Pepsi executive whom Enrico plucked from 
retirement to map out and help direct the company's overhaul. The shift in personnel policies not only cured the 
disease but lowered expenses and provided much-needed continuity for PepsiCo's worldwide endeavors. 
More important, Pepsi took a hard look at how it generated and managed cash, a resource that arguably hadn't 
been treated with sufficiently deserving respect, perhaps because of its historic abundance. In the past, division 
heads were held to profit- and sales-growth targets, notes Indra Nooyi, Pepsi's chief financial officer and onetime 
chief strategist. But none save the CEO had accountability for cash returns. 
Along with pushing cash-flow responsibility down the line, the tough but wry von der Heyden, then serving as 
CFO, took a very unPepsi-like stance toward checkbook management. If you spent your alloted pot of change, 
Big Daddy no longer blithely wrote overdraft privileges. At the same time, Pepsi moved merger and acquisition 
decisions to the corporate level, standardizing its vetting procedures. 
Lastly, Enrico raised the stature of share buybacks, a practice investors have praised. From 1997 through last 
year, the company spent $6 billion to repurchase 164 million shares. This year, Pepsi already has shelled out at 
least $700 million or so, as part of a three-year, $3 billion buyback program ending in 2001. 
PepsiCo's new-found religion in matters financial (Nooyi calls it a judicious blend of "fiscal restraint, on the one 
hand, and prudent growth on the other") has yielded enviable results. Total revenues have declined by roughly a 
third since '96, but profits from ongoing operations have fallen less than 20%. Pro forma operating margins have 
shot up to 15%, from 10%; free cash flow after capital expenditures remained around $2 billion, and return on 
invested capital has increased by a third, to 20%. The company's balance sheet has been equally profoundly 
impacted. With the restaurant operations and most of Pepsi Bottling gone, long-term debt has dropped to $2.8 
billion from $8.2 billion in '96. 
After years of erratic performance, Enrico and his top lieutenants -- primarily PepsiCo president Steve 
Reinemund, Nooyi and van der Heyden -- now expect to expand revenues by 6%-7% annually, largely through 
volume increases. This would translate into gains of 10%-11% in operating profit. "We're in the sweet spot of the 
food and beverage business," a confident Nooyi says. "Meals are out, grazing is in." 
The company thinks it can get another one to three percentage points of lift from share buybacks, tighter expense 
controls, and higher returns on invested capital, bringing the long-term sustainable growth rate in annual earnings 
per share to 12%-13%. Such goals might seem, well, a tad boring in today's loopy market, but Pepsi's ability to 
deliver like clockwork would be anything but. Besides, the ranks of those who will settle for this brand of boredom 
seem to be growing with each hairpin turn of the Nasdaq. 
While the recent pop in Pepsi's stock owes in part to the market's renewed interest in Old Economy issues (not 
that sector-rotation has put the fizz back in Coke), give Enrico, the master marketer, his due. This year, the 
seasoned cola warrior has turned road warrior, too, traversing the land to talk up Pepsi's brightening prospects 
with the company's biggest investors. His message is unequivocal: Pepsi's recovery is no flash in the pan, and its 
stock deserves to trade at the premium price/earnings multiples historically accorded other blue-chip consumer 
issues such as Coke, Gillette, Colgate Palmolive, Procter & Gamble and Estee Lauder. 
"He should be careful what he asks for when some of those companies' multiples are in free fall," says David 
Carlson, a portfolio manager at GE Asset Management, who recently brought a team to Purchase to meet with

Page 156 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Pepsi's top brass. All kidding aside, though, Carlson likes the story. "The changes at Pepsi are fairly profound, 
and they are somewhat underappreciated by investors," he says. 
Tom Cole, a senior analyst at Brinson Partners, in Chicago, agrees. "We still see a lot of value in the stock," says 
Cole, who is awaiting his own Enrico visit. "The company's fundamentals are intact, and there is every indication 
that analysts' estimates are rising." Cole also applauds Reinemund's promotion last year to the posts of president 
and chief operating officer, a move that would seem to position the former Frito-Lay chief to someday succeed 
Enrico, now 55. 
"If there's such a thing as an heir-apparent, he's as apparent as there is," Enrico quips. "The man knows how to 
lead a team and get results." 
Reinemund firmly refused to comment on how, or whether, he might one day lead Pepsi. In any case, the 
company's current chief has plenty of work left to do. As Enrico warms to the topic of PepsiCo's transformation, 
he slides so far forward in his chair that his knees nearly touch the floor. It is a perfect supplicating stance for 
someone used to selling products that nobody, technically, needs. Yet the ever-animated 29-year PepsiCo 
veteran need not apologize for his team's achievements. Judging by the numbers, Pepsi has done a fine job not 
just cleaning its cupboards, but convincing the public that soft drinks and chips are two of the five major food 
groups. 
For openers, Frito-Lay ships more than half of the nation's snack chips, and boasts 40% of the category's global 
volume. Tropicana is No. 1 both here and abroad in sales of chilled branded juice. Not to be outdone, Pepsi's 
Aquafina is the best-selling brand of non-jug bottled water in the U.S. -- and that's before a national campaign that 
kicked off this spring. The company's Mountain Dew soda, meanwhile, was last year's volume-growth leader in 
U.S. carbonated soft drinks, according to Beverage Digest/Maxwell, an industry score-keeper. 
The public's apparent affection for Pepsi's products is mirrored by that of the nation's grocers. PepsiCo is No. 2 in 
U.S. supermarket sales of branded products, behind only Philip Morris. Thanks to its vaunted direct-store-delivery 
system, which depends on company drivers, not store employees, to restock and merchandise shelves, Pepsi is 
the single greatest source of supermarket profits. And because its products typically turn over five or six times a 
month, before the retailer has to pay, the company generates about 20% of the average store's cash flow. 
For the past three years, Pepsi has been revamping its DSD system to boost its own cash flow. Previously the 
trucks had been much like rolling warehouses, in which drivers rummaged around each day for the needed goods 
with which to plug holes on supermarket shelves. With the help of industrial engineering, trucks now are 
prepacked based on store needs and drivers' routes. This practice increases the trucks' capacity, as drivers no 
longer need a "crawl space" to gather up their orders. In so doing, it dramatically increases the number of 
stockkeeping units, or SKUs, that each truck can carry. 
The last point is crucial, given Pepsi's reliance on additional new products to grow. Enrico doesn't mince words. "If 
we don't innovate we will atrophy," he declares. "In the salty snacks business, especially in the U.S., the amount 
of product news we generate in any given year is correlated to the amount of sales growth in the category." At 
Frito-Lay, Nooyi adds, new products introduced since 1995 now account for 35% of profits. 
Much of Pepsi's new-product development historically has relied on variations on successful themes, and that 
practice will continue. "Another flavor of Doritos does very well, thank you," Enrico says. 
But Pepsi's chairman believes the company has been too inwardly focused in its innovation efforts, and he 
expects "tuckin" acquisitions, joint ventures and other corporate alliances, both here and abroad, to play a greater 
role in future growth. If Pepsi is smart and lucky, most will look like Cracker Jacks, which the company picked up 
from Borden for two times sales -- the brand had no earnings -- in 1998. Once "Pepsitized" -- the line was honed, 
the product tweaked and the bags and boxes run through Pepsi's distribution network -- Cracker Jacks doubled 
its annual sales to $100 million. 
Pepsi has been cited more than once this spring as a possible bidder for Nabisco Group Holdings, which was put 
in play by financier Carl Icahn. Several European food giants are circling the cookie-maker, but Enrico's steering 
clear. "If we're going to add a fourth leg to PepsiCo, I want to make sure it's got our growth dynamics," he says. "I 
don't think the cookie and biscuit business does. We've thought about and watched the company a lot, but 
concluded we'd be looking at dilution near-term, and not adding long-term to our ability to grow." 
That said, Enrico is shrewd enough to leave himself an out. "It's a `no' unless someone waltzes in here and 
shows us a great way to do the deal that we'd never dreamed of," he says.

Many Pepsi fans think Frito-Lay International could be the company's biggest growth engine, given rising 
disposable income and disproportionately low snackfood consumption abroad. Last year, the unit's $3.75 billion in 
sales and $406 million in operating profits were restrained by economic problems in Brazil, but this year's stellar 
first-quarter results shed greater light on the potential for the business. Powered by Sabrita's, Mexico's largest 
snack-food company, and Walker's, Pepsi's salty-snacks business in the United Kingdom, Frito-Lay 
International's operating profits surged 27%, to $99 million, while sales rose 17%, to $918 million. 
If investors deem Frito-Lay PepsiCo's crown jewel, they're a bit more skeptical, and rightly so, about its 
Pepsi-Cola division. Last year, total carbonated softdrink volume grew a scant 0.5% in the U.S., as outsized price 
hikes of 6%-7% notably curbed sales. By this year's second half, however, most industry observers, PepsiCo 
included, expect growth to rebound to historic levels of around 3%. "Price wars had driven soda prices down to 
the point where bottlers couldn't get a decent return on supermarket sales," says Pepsi's von der Heyden. "While 
there is some room left to raise prices, at least in step with inflation, I would rather see a reduction in the 
frequency of promotions." 
Ironically, von der Heyden's wish could prove prophetic, chiefly because of Coca-Cola's journey back to health. 
"The changes that seem to be coming about at Coke are also positive for us," Enrico explains. "Sometimes in the 
past, we had to go down a blind alley because the competition took us there. When Coke gets stronger, we'll 
have an opportunity to compete in a more financially disciplined way, on a more level playing field." 
Lowering the temperature seems altogether sensible to Brinson's Tom Cole, the firm's beverage expert. "Coke's 
growth is coming internationally, and Pepsi's is coming from Frito-Lay," he says. "It is in the companies' mutual 
best interest not to destroy the domestic market and eat up each other's share." 
Pepsi might even have a competitive advantage through its second-hand influence in the fountain market. For 
many years, Coke made great hay of PepsiCo's restaurant interests (Pepsi owned Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and 
KFC), loudly urging potential fountain customers not to buy concentrate from their restaurant rival. With the Tricon 
spinoff, Pepsi redoubled its efforts in fountain sales, although it failed to win big contracts from chains such as 
Burger King and Wendy's. Yet its aggressive bidding is thought to have lowered victor Coke's margins 
significantly. 
"For years, Coca-Cola had a free ride in the fountain business, which it used to pressure Pepsi," says Bill 
Pecoriello, Sanford C. Bernstein's noted beverage analyst. Now, he implies, Pepsi's indirectly exerting a little 
pressure of its own. 
Overseas, however, Pepsi-Cola has been taking a markedly different tack. Chastened by experience, the 
company is less intent on butting head with Coke where the latter has a seeming stranglehold on the business. 
Pepsi has divided its international beverage opportunities into three distinct segments. "We're going to play in the 
first leagues in countries where we're either No. 1 or a strong No. 2," Enrico says. "These countries account for 
about half our overseas volume." 
In countries where Pepsi doesn't have "scale" -- about 100, in all -- the company is aligning with local bottlers. But 
in the third group of nations, which includes India and China, Pepsi-Cola's boldly staking its claim. "Political 
changes that have occurred since 1990 have given us access to huge numbers of people in economies that are 
expected to grow faster than global GDP, irrespective of who has a head start," says Enrico. 
Pepsi's been spending money to build up its brand in these emerging markets, and Enrico admits these 
investments are "probably our biggest P&L hit." Last year Pepsi-Cola International reported operating profits of 
$108 million on sales of $1.8 billion, resulting in slender margins of 6%. Building out its international beverage 
business, after a series of wipeouts in the 1990s, will require a delicate balancing act. 
Pepsi has deftly hedged its bets in the slow-growing cola market with an increasingly diverse stable of carb and 
non-carb beverages. In recent years, high-caloric, citrus-flavored Mountain Dew -- a favorite with teenage boys 
and young men -- has become the company's, and one of the industry's, fastest-growing sodas, although the 
brand has been on PepsiCo's shelf since the 'Sixties. Last year, "Dew" climbed to No. 4 in U.S. carbonated 
soft-drink volume, behind Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola and Diet Coke, with a 7.1% market share. 
Where Pepsi shines lately, however, is in the non-bubbly stuff. Its eclectic alternative lineup, which includes 
bottled water, ready-to-drink teas (through a joint venture with Unilever's Lipton), bottled coffee (Starbucks' 
Frappuccino) and a new fruit juice last year boasted volume growth of 17%, well above the industry average. 
Neither Pepsi nor Coke have made a perceptible dent in the sportsdrink category, although Bill Pecoriello, of 
Bernstein, argued in a recent report that PepsiCo could do wonders with Quaker Oats' Gatorade if it bought

Quaker and then shed that company's food operations. But his thesis fell short on several key counts: Quaker's 
not selling, and Pepsi would never cotton to a hugely dilutive purchase. 
Two years ago, Seagram put its Tropicana division on the market, and PepsiCo, spotting a winner, quickly 
snapped up the brand for $3.3 billion. Largely by adding vitamins and calcium, Pepsi has pumped up Tropicana's 
sales and established a beachhead in the growing nutritional market. Reinemund considers Tropicana a 
"tremendous opportunity," and Pepsi is studying ways to expand distribution beyond the brand's Northeast 
stronghold. Tropicana's margins, however, are considerably lower than Pepsi-Cola's and FritoLay's. In '99, the

PEPSICO LOSES ITS TASTE FOR FAST FOOD CHAINS. 
PEPSICO LOSES ITS TASTE FOR FAST FOOD CHAINS.

The cola group plans to focus on drinks and snacks, writes Richard Tomkins. 
It seemed a good idea at the time. In the mid-1970s, PepsiCo saw less-than-stellar prospects for its soft drink and 
salty snack operations, and started buying fast food chains to speed up earnings growth. 
Twenty years later, the strategy is being turned on its head. 
PepsiCo has announced its decision to get out of the fast food business by spinning off its restaurant division to 
shareholders. 
From now on, it will be down to soft drinks and salty snacks to put the fizz back into the company's profits. 
In the mid-1970s, the growth potential of the Pepsi-Cola soft drinks business was seen as constrained by its 
already high penetration of the US market. 
Overseas, Pepsi-Cola's opportunities were thought to be limited by Coca-Cola's size, by closed economies and 
by low incomes in developing countries. 
The salty snacks business, meanwhile, was essentially a US affair. 
In a conference call with analysts on Friday, Mr Roger Enrico, PepsiCo's chairman and chief executive, said its 
occasional forays into international markets met with little success. 
"For example, we took Fritos to France, but we learned pretty quickly that the French wanted to stick with foie 
gras," Mr Enrico said. "We took some very embarrassing and difficult losses at the time, so it didn't look too 
great." 
PepsiCo entered the restaurant business with the acquisition of Pizza Hut in 1977. Taco Bell was added the 
following year and Kentucky Fried Chicken - now KFC - was bought in 1986. 
The acquisitions were hardly a flop: for a time, amid a big expansion programme, they delivered good profit 
growth. 
Meanwhile, the soft drink and snack businesses did better than expected, helped by strong performances in the 
US and an unexpectedly rapid opening of world markets. 
More recently, however, the group as a whole has run into a series of difficulties. 
Some have been on the restaurant side, where intense competition in the US fast food market has hurt profits. 
Others have been in international soft drinks, where Pepsi-Cola burned up money in a quixotic attempt to defeat 
the mighty Coke in some of its strongest territories. 
Shareholder concern over PepsiCo's mounting troubles led to increasing pressure for some kind of spin-off. 
Divesting the Frito-Lay salty snacks division was hardly an option. 
It had become the best-performing part of the business, and the soft drinks division was sacrosanct because it 
was the heart and soul of the company.

Page 160 of 162 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The restaurant division, however, appeared a more suitable candidate: not just because of its recent poor 
performance, but because, as a retailing business, it sat a little awkwardly with PepsiCo's other two divisions, 
which manufactured packaged goods. 
Mr Enrico, who had previously headed the restaurant division, implied that he regretted the spin-off. 
He said he thought restaurants were "a terrific business" and added, almost wistfully: "I think, one day, we are 
going to see more KFC restaurants in China than we do in the US." 
Even so, analysts and investors welcomed the move, seeing it as providing PepsiCo's management with the 
opportunity to focus on the remaining businesses. PepsiCo's stock closed on Friday at $33 7/8 - up $3 3/8, or 
11%, on the week. 
One benefit of the spin-off will be PepsiCo's ability to pass on some of its $8bn ( #4.7bn) in debt to the restaurant 
company, giving PepsiCo greater resources for an acquisition. But Mr Enrico appeared to rule out the idea that 
PepsiCo might bid for Quaker Oats' Gatorade and Snapple drinks businesses, saying no significant acquisitions 
were in its business plans. 
Mr Enrico said the opportunities for the slimmed-down PepsiCo were far greater than the company had viewed 
them 20 years ear-lier. 
A top priority for the company would be to improve profits in the international soft drinks business by 
concentrating on growth markets instead of trying to beat Coke on its own turf. 
"We are pretty realistic that we are not going to catch Coke in Japan or Germany, or some of these other parts of 
the world where they have a big head start and have done a great job building their business," Mr Enrico said. 
"But in places like China, India, eastern Europe and a number of other places around the globe, we think there 
are billions of customers up for grabs." 
On the salty snack side, Mr Enrico said experience had shown that PepsiCo could move its snack food brands 
around the world: "We took Doridos to the UK just about 18 months ago and it has built to a $60m brand already." 
Mr Michael Branca, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the remaining soft drink and snack food operations were 
"exceptionally powerful businesses with a predictable 15-20% long-term growth rate in earnings per share" - 
conceivably putting them on a par with Coca-Cola, with its predictable 18% growth rate. 
In a rare moment of humility for a chief executive, Mr Enrico confessed: "Clearly, we have stubbed our toe pretty 
big time here in the last couple of years." 
But he added: "We intend fully to learn the lessons from that and not repeat that. 
"We have got a whole new strategy that will stand us in far better stead than the one we were on before."

From now on, it will be down to soft drinks and salty snacks to put the fizz back into the company's profits. 
In the mid-1970s, the growth potential of the Pepsi-Cola soft drinks business was seen as constrained by its 
already high penetration of the US market. 
Overseas, Pepsi-Cola's opportunities were thought to be limited by Coca-Cola's size, by closed economies and 
by low incomes in developing countries. 
The salty snacks business, meanwhile, was essentially a US affair. 
In a conference call with analysts on Friday, Mr Roger Enrico, PepsiCo's chairman and chief executive, said its 
occasional forays into international markets met with little success. 
"For example, we took Fritos to France, but we learned pretty quickly that the French wanted to stick with foie 
gras," Mr Enrico said. "We took some very embarrassing and difficult losses at the time, so it didn't look too 
great." 
PepsiCo entered the restaurant business with the acquisition of Pizza Hut in 1977. Taco Bell was added the 
following year and Kentucky Fried Chicken - now KFC - was bought in 1986. 
The acquisitions were hardly a flop: for a time, amid a big expansion programme, they delivered good profit 
growth. 
Meanwhile, the soft drink and snack businesses did better than expected, helped by strong performances in the 
US and an unexpectedly rapid opening of world markets. 
More recently, however, the group as a whole has run into a series of difficulties. 
Some have been on the restaurant side, where intense competition in the US fast food market has hurt profits. 
Others have been in international soft drinks, where Pepsi-Cola burned up money in a quixotic attempt to defeat 
the mighty Coke in some of its strongest territories. 
Shareholder concern over PepsiCo's mounting troubles led to increasing pressure for some kind of spin-off. 
Divesting the Frito-Lay salty snacks division was hardly an option. 
It had become the best-performing part of the business, and the soft drinks division was sacrosanct because it 
was the heart and soul of the company.

The restaurant division, however, appeared a more suitable candidate: not just because of its recent poor 
performance, but because, as a retailing business, it sat a little awkwardly with PepsiCo's other two divisions, 
which manufactured packaged goods. 
Mr Enrico, who had previously headed the restaurant division, implied that he regretted the spin-off. 
He said he thought restaurants were "a terrific business" and added, almost wistfully: "I think, one day, we are 
going to see more KFC restaurants in China than we do in the US." 
Even so, analysts and investors welcomed the move, seeing it as providing PepsiCo's management with the 
opportunity to focus on the remaining businesses. PepsiCo's stock closed on Friday at $33 7/8 - up $3 3/8, or 
11%, on the week. 
One benefit of the spin-off will be PepsiCo's ability to pass on some of its $8bn ( #4.7bn) in debt to the restaurant 
company, giving PepsiCo greater resources for an acquisition. But Mr Enrico appeared to rule out the idea that 
PepsiCo might bid for Quaker Oats' Gatorade and Snapple drinks businesses, saying no significant acquisitions 
were in its business plans. 
Mr Enrico said the opportunities for the slimmed-down PepsiCo were far greater than the company had viewed 
them 20 years ear-lier. 
A top priority for the company would be to improve profits in the international soft drinks business by 
concentrating on growth markets instead of trying to beat Coke on its own turf. 
"We are pretty realistic that we are not going to catch Coke in Japan or Germany, or some of these other parts of 
the world where they have a big head start and have done a great job building their business," Mr Enrico said. 
"But in places like China, India, eastern Europe and a number of other places around the globe, we think there 
are billions of customers up for grabs." 
On the salty snack side, Mr Enrico said experience had shown that PepsiCo could move its snack food brands 
around the world: "We took Doridos to the UK just about 18 months ago and it has built to a $60m brand already." 
Mr Michael Branca, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the remaining soft drink and snack food operations were 
"exceptionally powerful businesses with a predictable 15-20% long-term growth rate in earnings per share" - 
conceivably putting them on a par with Coca-Cola, with its predictable 18% growth rate. 
In a rare moment of humility for a chief executive, Mr Enrico confessed: "Clearly, we have stubbed our toe pretty 
big time here in the last couple of years." 
But he added: "We intend fully to learn the lessons from that and not repeat that. 
"We have got a whole new strategy that will stand us in far better stead than the one we were on before."
