2009 NOV 18 - (VerticalNews.com) -- Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE:BHI) announced that net income for the 
third quarter 2009 was $55 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared to $429 million or $1.39 per diluted share 
for the third quarter 2008 and $87 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the second quarter 2009. Net income for 
the third quarter 2009 includes expenses of $38 million before tax ($0.08 per share) associated with 
reorganization, severance and acquisition costs, and an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. 
As previously reported, net income for the second quarter 2009 included expenses of $54 million before tax 
($0.13 per share) comprised of $16 million ($0.04 per share) associated with employee severance and 
reorganization costs and $38 million ($0.09 per share) associated with increasing our allowance for doubtful 
accounts. 
Revenue for the third quarter 2009 was $2.23 billion, down 26% compared to $3.01 billion for the third quarter 
2008 and down 4% compared to $2.34 billion for the second quarter 2009. 
Chad C. Deaton, Baker Hughes chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Third quarter North 
America operating margins rebounded from the low set in the second quarter of 2009. Aggressive cost cutting in 
the first half of 2009 enabled us to absorb additional price decreases and improve profitability on modest activity 
increases. 
"International results were disappointing with revenue less than expected and price discounting greater than 
expected. Our operating profit margin was also impacted by the extra costs we are carrying to assure a smooth 
organizational transition we announced in May 2009. Given the progress we are making on this company 
transformation these additional costs should largely be behind us as we enter 2010. 
"Looking forward, gas-directed drilling in North America is gradually increasing and we believe this trend will likely 
continue through 2010. Internationally, we believe that customer spending reached its low point this quarter and 
that forecasts for increasing economic growth, particularly in China, India and the Middle East, combined with 
modest spare production capacity are supporting higher oil prices and laying the foundation for increased 
spending in 2010. 
"We are continuing to make good progress on the pending BJ Services transaction. Regulatory filings have been 
made in the US and in some international jurisdictions, and our preliminary proxy statement has been filed and is 
being reviewed by the SEC. We have received a 'second request' from the Department of Justice which is limited 
in product and geographical scope. As a result of the second request, we now project that the transaction will 
close in the first quarter of 2010. 
"With the pending addition of BJ Services, we expect to significantly advance our competitiveness as we improve 
our customer intimacy, operational effectiveness, and product portfolio." 
During the third quarter 2009, debt decreased $23 million to $1.81 billion and cash and short-term investments 
increased $125 million to $1.49 billion as compared to the second quarter 2009. Capital expenditures were $222 
million, depreciation and amortization expense was $177 million and dividend payments were $47 million in the 
third quarter 2009.

(c) 2009 Business News Americas (BNamericas.com) 
A planned merger between oil services companies Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI) and BJ Services (NYSE: BJS) 
will close sometime in the first quarter of next year, Baker CEO Chad Deaton told a webcast. 
In Latin America and the Caribbean, Baker's footprint includes a presence in Bogotá, Buenos Aires, Caracas, 
Mexico City and Rio de Janeiro. 
BJ's coverage in the region spans Argentina, Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, 
Peru, Trinidad and Venezuela. 
"We've established an integration team that is staffed and has been working to assure a smooth transaction once 
we close," said Deaton. 
"We made our most critical regulatory filings and are working with the different agencies to obtain the necessary 
clearance for the merger," he added. 
The US$5.5bn merger will allow Baker and BJ to compete with Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) and Halliburton 
(NYSE: HAL), the executive said previously. 
REGIONAL OUTLOOK 
Mexico will improve this quarter following project startup costs and activity is still strong in Brazil, Deaton said in 
the presentation. 
"Argentina is a mess. We don't see any bright stars there," according to the CEO. Baker has highlighted that 
country's high labor costs. 
And in Venezuela, an increase in payments will encourage Baker to resume taking on work there, he added.

Operational Highlights 
North America 
Revenue in North America reflected changes in the North America rig count which was down 52% year-over-year. 
The sequential quarterly improvement was primarily driven by a 13% increase in the North America rig count, 
where a strong seasonal rebound in Canada was partially offset by a 32% decrease in offshore drilling as 
offshore activity slowed during the Gulf of Mexico hurricane season. 
The sequential improvement in profit before tax and profit before tax margins demonstrated the advantages of our 
early and aggressive cost cutting in the first half of 2009 which overcame incremental price discounting in the 
third quarter 2009. 
During the quarter, and in collaboration with a major U.S. independent operator, our US Land geomarket team 
successfully installed the first 24-stage FracPoint(TM) EX open hole isolation completion system in the Williston 
Basin. 
In addition, we launched our IntelliFrac(TM) service, an integration of our advanced micro-seismic services with 
state-of-the-art fracturing and production enhancement services from BJ Services. This combined offering of 
services enables operators to monitor fracture dimensions during stimulation treatments and allows real-time 
control of fracture operations. 
Latin America 
Revenue declined year-over-year as increased revenue from the Mexico / Central America geomarket was offset 
by reduced revenue from the Venezuela and Argentina / Bolivia / Chile geomarkets. Revenue declined 
sequentially primarily due to lower activity in the Venezuela geomarket. Operating profit margin in the third quarter 
was adversely impacted by incremental costs in the Mexico / Central America and Brazil geomarkets associated 
with start-up activity, and higher labor costs in the Argentina / Bolivia / Chile geomarket. 
During the quarter we were awarded a contract for intelligent completions for the pre-salt Tupi field in Brazil 
valued in excess of $50 million.

In the Mexico/Central America geomarket, we operated on a record six rigs in the Alma marine integrated 
services project for PEMEX, and we completed the drilling phase of the first Alma well and started completion 
operations. In addition, we introduced FracPoint(TM) into the Mexico/Central America geomarket, and 
commenced operations on three ATG integrated contracts awarded by PEMEX to local integrated operations 
suppliers last quarter. Under these three contracts, Baker Hughes is providing individual product line well 
construction technologies and services as a subcontractor. 
Also during the third quarter, our newly-deployed BEACON center for Mexico became fully operational, providing 
permanent real-time monitoring visibility of ongoing operations allowing Baker Hughes experts from around the 
world to provide support on operational and technical challenges as they arise. 
Europe Africa Russia Caspian 
Revenue declined year-over-year in all geomarkets with the exception of Angola, with the largest declines in the 
Russia, UK and Norway geomarkets. Sequentially, revenues declined as the increases in the Norway, Sub 
Sahara Africa, and Caspian geomarkets were more than offset by declines in the UK, Russia, Continental 
Europe, Angola and Libya geomarkets. 
Baker Hughes drilled and completed the first well using our 9-5/8" steerable liner drilling system for a client in 
Norway. The system features INTEQ directional drilling systems, Hughes Christensen drill bits and Baker Oil 
Tools completion systems. 
In Azerbaijan we were awarded a $300 million contract in the third quarter 2009 for directional drilling, formation 
evaluation and completion systems. Work is expected to commence in January 2010. 
Middle East Asia Pacific 
The year-over-year revenue decline in the region was in line with the decline in the rig count, with higher revenue 
from the Australasia and India/Southwest Asia geomarkets being offset by lower revenue from all other Middle 
East Asia Pacific geomarkets. Compared to the second quarter 2009, revenue increases in the India / Southwest 
Asia, Indonesia, and Australasia geomarkets were more than offset by reduced revenue in the North Asia, Egypt, 
Gulf and Southeast Asia geomarkets. 
During the quarter we were awarded drilling, evaluation and completion contracts for a twelve well deepwater 
exploration program for a consortium of six major integrated oil companies operating in Indonesia. 
In the Gulf geomarket, we achieved a new milestone in reservoir characterization, performing one of the largest 
ever onshore 3D Vertical Seismic Profiling jobs for a major National Oil Company.

Oil field services company Baker Hughes has agreed to buy rival BJ Services Company in a cash-and-stock deal 
worth $5.5 billion. Baker Hughes CEO Chad Deaton said the purchase would allow it to expand internationally 
and compete for projects with companies engaged in all phases of the oil business. 
The deal is expected to produce $75 million in cost savings for Baker Hughes in 2010 and $150 million in 2011, 
and add to earnings per share in 2011, the company said. Deaton said the transaction would assist customers 
with unconventional gas and deepwater fields. 
"It will better position us to drive international growth and to compete for the growing large integrated projects by 
incorporating pressure pumping into our product offering," Deaton said. Pressure pumping comprised less than 
1% of Baker Hughes's 2008 revenue, but is now expected to account for 20% of revenue.

JIM CRANDELL, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Okay, our next presenting company will be Baker Hughes. 
And here from Baker Hughes is Chad Deaton, Chairman, President and CEO of the Company. Chad joined 
Baker Hughes almost five years ago following a 25-year career with Schlumberger culminating in him being 
Executive Vice President of Oilfield Services. And then he served for roughly two years as President and CEO of 
Hanover Compressor. 
Over the past five years under Chad's direction the Company has substantially ramped up its spending and its 
presence in the eastern hemisphere, going to a geographic structured management from a product line oriented 
one, and last week announced an acquisition agreement with BJ Services. I'm pleased to welcome him back to 
our conference. Chad? 
CHAD DEATON, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT, CEO, BAKER HUGHES, INC.: Well, thank you, Jim. Good morning, 
ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to be able to talk to you about a subject that Jim just referenced, which, to 
put it bluntly, we're pretty excited about in Baker Hughes today and that's the acquisition of Baker Hughes. 
I wanted to introduce a couple of the people, of course Peter who is going to talk later on in the presentation, talk 
a little bit about the financial part of this transaction. And for the first two-thirds or so I'm going to talk about the 
rationale and the strategic initiative or the reason why we felt this acquisition needed to be done. In the room also 
with us is Gary Flaharty, sitting back here who I think most of you know is in charge of our IR group. 
Clearly probably have two slides this time with the forward-looking statements and the risk factor. We will be 
issuing a proxy jointly with BJ and ourselves soon. So clearly I ask that you familiarize yourself with the various 
risk factors associated with that and other information you can find in the SEC and DOJ filings. 
Let me start with this slide and mainly focus on the right side for just a second because Baker Hughes is a 
100-year-old company. For a good significant portion of that time clearly the industry, E&P as well as service 
company, have been very much focused on that very top conventional hydrocarbons, gas, oil, traditional fields 
around the world, mainly Europe, US, etc., Middle East. But traditionally just conventional type services and 
equipment that was required. 
But over the last several years, probably the last five to 10 years, there's been a significant change in our client 
base. Significant change in terms of the complexity and the technology that's required to start delving into some of 
these other markets that you might call around the world. Deepwater, a good example of that was just last week 
on BP's announcement, and I can't remember 6000, 7000 feet of water and 35,000 feet of dirt, deep, deep 
challenging type drilling environment for the discovery. I'll talk a little bit more on that in a minute. 
Clearly unconventional gas, two, three years ago I don't think anybody in this room would have believed that the 
potential for unconventional gas in these shale plays, Marcellus, Haynesville, could radically change the way we 
look at gas in the US or position US in the world's gas situation. 
Unconventional oil same thing. Canada heavy oils, tar sands, Venezuela, Russia, a lot of heavy oil. Kuwait, a lot 
of challenges out there. Plenty of oil, plenty of technical challenges. 
And then there are two in there that I threw in, geothermal and carbon captured sequestration. In fact, if some of 
you are actually going to visit next week when we have our new open house for the new Celle research center in 
Germany, the extension of that along with a European investor conference. 
One of the things that you would see there, thanks to a provision from the German government and the European 
Union for that matter, Celle will become our center of excellence for geothermal research because they see this 
as a key area of energy in Europe going forward and a lot of that technology that will come out over the next 
years for geothermal is also going to be applied obviously in the deepwater plays where temperatures of 500Â° 
are common.

Page 19 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
And then carbon capture sequestration, clearly in Europe but increasingly becoming more of a situation and an 
issue here in the US and we're playing with some state governments, some universities along with some clients 
regarding a role that we'll play long-term in the sequestration of the carbon. And of course, clearly with the 
changing of the oil companies, the national oil companies, integrated operations in these last five years have 
really taken off. 
On the left side of this chart I think you've -- for those of you that have followed us over the last couple, three 
years, there are three areas that we've broken down that we said we need to be working with our customer and 
our client. And that was in being able to understand the reservoir; we didn't believe that we needed to be waiting 
around any longer waiting for the client to tell us what needs to be done and calling us out. 
Therefore we felt that we needed to be making the decisions with the client, especially the NOC, we needed to 
understand the reservoir much better. We need to be able to access the reservoir, in other words, mostly the 
drilling side to be able to drill these complicated, challenging extended reach wells and other wells around the 
world and to be able to pinpoint a target and hit it. 
And then of course the third area is producing of the hydrocarbon itself. And that alone, if you look at these deep 
discoveries in deepwater, proven they can drill them, but can you complete them? And that's a challenge. 
Baker Hughes traditionally has clearly played a very strong role in the bottom there, leaders in completions, 
chemicals, ESPs, artificial lift, etc. And have played a nice role in a big part of accessing the reservoir from main 
(inaudible) through the drilling side. Our LWD, MWD type operations at INTEQ, our bits from Hughes 
Christensen, of course fluids and formation evaluation on wireline as well as LWD. 
About a year and a half ago we really began to build out the reservoir capability of the Company. We made four 
acquisitions -- GCA, GMI, EPIC and Helix. Prior to that time most of our reservoir specialists, petrophysicists, etc., 
resided down into our individual product lines located in scattered places around. But due to these recent 
acquisitions we now have a reservoir technology consultancy group that is staffed with about 350 petrophysicists, 
geophysicists, etc., that are centered in key centers of excellence around the globe. 
This is a group that worked very closely with the national oil companies in Iraq in terms of the reservoir studies, 
Turkmenistan to validate their huge 200 trillion cubic feet finds, it was a GCA type study that had been done over 
the last couple of years. But an area that we clearly were still not playing in on accessing the reservoir as well as 
following down in producing is down in the area of cementing, coil tubing, hydraulic fracturing and offshore 
pressure pumping -- a big gap that we had in our portfolio. 
Also if you've been following us we've been pretty consistent in saying what, from an acquisition criteria 
standpoint what is it that we'd be looking for in acquisitions? And we said that we wanted to fill gaps that we had 
in our portfolio. The reservoir acquisitions filled that gap. We had a major gap in the pressure pumping side and 
the ones I put over there, BJ clearly fills that gap. 
We also said that if it made sense we would want to add to our existing product lines and complement them. And 
in the BJ acquisition there's about $1 billion of revenue I'll show you at the end that overlaps into our type of 
services that will enhance our other services. 
We wanted to make sure any acquisition continued to have something to focus on the reservoir on the production 
side of it, which this does. We believe this will make us much more competitive on integrated operations, which I'll 
talk to. And the other thing that we've always said is that we don't want to make an acquisition that didn't bring 
some kind of technology with it, some kind of intellectual property or some know how rather than just some piece 
of equipment, or whatever. 
And if you look at it you can see that we were missing this gap, if you look at the five major service companies out 
there that are our peer group and you look at the two on the left and you see what pressure pumping, just the 
pressure pumping side makes up and those two. 
And you can see that for one, for Schlumberger, it's about one-fourth of their global revenue, and if you look at 
Halliburton it's close to 40%. It's a big, big part of their total package integrated or just basic services around the 
world. And pro forma would put us at about 24% of our revenue would be coming through the pressure pumping 
side. 
So again, it's this critical mass; pressure pumping tends to be a little more capital intensive, that's true, but also 
people intensive. You tend to be larger into operations in key markets around the world. I'll show you where some 
of the areas where BJ plays strongly as well as we do; it will add some additional mass so that we can be able to

Page 20 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
compete better and offer a broader portfolio. I've already said it, but I think it makes Baker Hughes much more 
competitive internationally than where we were before. 
And the other thing that we've constantly talked about is that these gaps that we had in our portfolio we had no 
interest in going out and just making an acquisition to fill a box and check that box and say, okay, now we're in 
pressure pumping or we're in some area and yet find that we're number seven or eight or number nine in the 
marketplace. 
So we've always said that we need to be in the top two or three -- one, two or three because we feel that is what 
the clients will look at, take you seriously, they will know you when you go into Saudi or Brazil and you'll be a 
serious player on their critical wells. 
This acquisition will clearly fill that gap for us. The column on the left there is the size of the 2008 market, the 
history, so we know that, you can look at it. Those numbers on the left will total about $110 billion, that's the world 
that we play in with mainly against, again, our two major competitors. 
In pressure pumping and the coiled tubing, if you look at that it represents 25% of that $110 billion, an area again 
where Schlumberger and Halliburton played where we didn't play. And it's a big, big chunk of the market out there 
that we just weren't having access to. Along with this also there are some of the smaller type plays and we'll be 
number three in casing and tubing services which is a small business they have that's growing and one that we 
will keep. 
This core business of coil tubing, cementing, hydraulic fracturing as well as acidizing and their other businesses, 
we think we have the opportunity to grow those as time goes forward. I'll show you in a minute some of the 
rationale why we're thinking that. 
If you look according to Spears on a global basis, BJ has about 17% of the world's pressure pumping market, we 
believe it's higher than that in North America, which obviously shows to the shale plays, they're a serious player in 
the shale plays. But we also think that this is an opportunity for us to grow on the international side a lot of their 
pressure pumping capabilities. 
We see four key areas of some growth opportunities, I'll just highlight on these four, that would be in the 
international market, integrated operations deep water and the shale itself in North America. There are places 
around the world where our infrastructure is much stronger and we believe that we can -- they can piggyback off 
us to be able to expand and get in. 
Places -- for instance [Solvay], Russia where it's been publicly announced, BJ did this themselves, that they just 
had a tough time in Russia being able to compete as a single product line of hydraulic fracturing across 10 time 
zones, a mass geographical challenge in terms of having enough equipment to spread and spread themselves 
too thin. 
If I looked at Baker Hughes and said that we could only take one of our product lines into Russia we wouldn't 
have been able to make it either. But by having mass in seven product lines Russia is a key area for us, we're a 
major player in Russia. That doesn't mean that upon the acquisition we would immediately jump back in with 
pressure pumping or cementing or oil tubing or acidizing. 
But with the infrastructure that we have there, the client relationships that we have there, an integrated type 
operation or package which some customers are using, we could see where this would be a very easy 
opportunity for us to be able to expand and again critical mass over a shared base makes lots of sense. 
They're very strong in Asia. It's an area which we've often said is our next place of focus. Where the weakest area 
that we have is in Asia, they're strong there. Good client relationships, we have a good working relationship with 
them there and we think that's going to be an area of growth where they'll pull us through. 
West Africa, we've made a lot of investment in West Africa, Angola, Nigeria and other places over these last two, 
three years, they don't have a big presence there. But they do -- there is a lot of offshore stimulation work that 
takes place in there. The problem is getting access to a base or, as rigs go in with a cementing unit on it, having 
access to a base for repair, etc. Again our facilities are there. This is an area where I think we're both excited 
about what opportunities lie ahead in Africa. 
Brazil is an area where we're in a very strong position for the drilling, evaluation and fluid side and bit side. 
They're very strongly positioned in terms of offshore stimulation and sand control, it's one of their strongest areas. 
And it's one of the best areas to be strong in around the world.

Page 21 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The North Sea is -- again is another area where you've only got one or two product lines, the infrastructure and 
the cost of dealing and working in Norway and the UK is extremely burdensome. With only one or two product 
lines you don't play that well there. It's probably two of our strongest areas where we're probably a significant 
market share and we definitely have significant market share in both UK and Norway. 
And again, a lot of infrastructure ourselves that we believe that in time, now these are longer term contracts to 
roll, so you're not going to do it immediately. But North Sea is where we believe in time we will see a benefit from 
having BJ pumping and coil tubing and some other services there. 
Let me talk about Mexico and Saudi Arabia on the next slide because here are two examples where the national 
oil companies are looking at integrated type operations. In Mexico it's clearly more IPM project management 
where you have to go in and build the road, cut the trees, do everything else. BJ is strong in Mexico because of 
the fracturing and the cementing that's involved there. In fact they're stronger than we were in that area. 
But we've won several integrated type projects in Mexico and we're teaming up with them like the Alma Project 
offshore on four rigs going to five. That's about a $500 million contract over a couple year period of time. They're 
providing the cementing and some other services for us out there. Again it's about one-third of the revenue is 
going to them, two-thirds to us. This is a case where it makes sense to have it under one roof. 
Another example of integrated operations where we see growing is like Iraq as an example. The clients, whether 
they're the National Oil Company of Iraq or the ICO's from the Western countries or Russians, the Chinese 
themselves -- there's no infrastructure there. 
So when they go in and there are no bases, so they're looking for the service sector to come in and those that can 
come in and offer the biggest package, going back to my slide that shows all of the gaps that we filled now, this is 
a great benefit to them because logistically we can get established and provide a greater breadth of services. And 
again cementing, coil tubing, fracking, acidizing in existing fields is a big market and it's one that we need to play 
a bigger role in. 
Deepwater, it's an area where Baker Hughes shines, we do very well on deepwater rigs. We have a nice 
significant market share on the completion side, the drilling side, the logging side, the bit side. And this is an area 
where BJ excels in offshore stimulation and the offshore sand control and gravel grapple packing. These wells 
that I mentioned, they're drilled in the Gulf of Mexico, the Trident and the White well and the Jack well from 
Chevron, the recent discovery from BP, the Kaskida, Cascade well. 
If you look at these walls, they're ultra deep, they're ultra hot, they're going to require hydraulic fracturing 
someday in order to be able to produce them, they're extremely tight. Or others are going to require sand control, 
massive sand control type services. We predict that in the future some of these offshore wells may require up to 2 
million pounds of profit in order to be able to frac them. 
It takes a huge fleet to be able to offer that on a global basis, we're in that business today as Baker Hughes small, 
a little bit with two vessels, they have 10 vessels. So this will again put us in a good position going forward on a 
global basis, Brazil, Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and other places to be able to play in this market. 
I think one of the areas overlooked is BJ cementing, especially on these deepwater rigs. They made a very smart 
move a couple of years ago in that they decided to place a lot of cement units in those rigs as they were built. 
Obviously you're placing a lot of capital in there, you don't recognize anything for it for two years until those rigs 
go to work. But these units are buried into the rig and usually if you have the cement unit on the rig and you 
provide a good service you're going to get that rig. And again, there are three main players that play in this 
deepwater, BJ being one of them, and that's a good reputation in that area. 
And finally the fourth area is right here in the US with the shale Plays. There's no doubt that there's a lot of gas in 
place right now, there's a lot of competition in the fracturing side of this market in that the margins are bad. But 
we've seen this rodeo before and this is my sixth cycle when we've been through it. 
They all end the same way, eventually there's consolidation, there are failures, there's a realization that these 
can't be provided at zero cost benefit or zero cash flow. And in time people will come back and this business -- 
the good news is there's a lot of gas there, it's going to provide gas for this country for many, many years to 
come. But it's going to require hydraulic fracturing. 
We play in those areas as Baker Hughes today. But when you look at a ticket on a typical Haynesville well, a 
Marcellus well, about half of it comes from fracking, the other half comes from our various types of services from 
LWD and bits and mud, etc. So it use is a huge market which in time I think will come back.

Page 22 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The other side of it here is that this is a good mix in that some of our competitors are applying this reservoir and 
this imaging to be able to drill these wells and guide them into the reservoir prior to the frac itself, it's a package. 
And BJ was struggling with that package and of course we were providing part of the services but not getting 
anything on the frac side. This was independent of our terms working together. They didn't know anything about 
the pending acquisition or anything else. 
But we've teamed up with BJ on a new product that's coming out, it's actually going to be presented at the SPE in 
New Orleans, it's a joint project between our reservoir team capabilities and BJ's frac and geo mechanics team in 
terms of using some of our imaging technologies and tools looking at gas in place and how to best stimulate 
these wells and then monitor and measure that stimulation through wellbore monitoring during the actual frac 
process itself which we will team up and do together. 
In terms of the integration, and the step going forward obviously we have some regulatory issues that we need to 
present to the government and get approval. We're hoping that this closes by year end. In the meantime we are 
putting transaction teams together, transition teams jointly to work on seeing the best way to fold this group 
together. 
We have compatible cultures, we've worked on many projects around the world before, our people know each 
other, which we think is a benefit. They have a very heavy focus on client as well as on service quality, well site 
execution, which fits Baker Hughes very well, so we think that will be a nice marriage. And we do see that as time 
goes on and at the right pace that it will integrate into our geo market organization and many of their people as we 
get to know them who will have key roles in those geographic organizations around the world, not just around the 
pressure pumping side. 
And finally just real quick before I turn it over to Peter. I just want to highlight this point about these 
complementary services. They do about $1 billion a year, as I mentioned, in other type of services, process and 
pipeline services, they have a very nice business, we have a very small piece there that we'll team up and work 
with them. I mentioned they're in casing and tubular services, an area where we don't work. And then in the other 
three we're at various sizes in terms of the completions and, of course, our large chemical services group at 
Petrolite will benefit from their experience and knowledge as well. 
So as I said, we think that strategically this acquisition makes a lot of sense, it wasn't just done on the North 
America hopes of Haynesville and Marcellus, they're very well positioned in those areas, we think that's a bonus. 
But clearly on the international side we see fracturing, acidizing, cementing -- all the things that they can do and 
are doing will benefit us in the years to come. So with that I'm going to turn it over to Peter. 
PETER RAGAUSS, SVP, CFO, BAKER HUGHES, INC.: Thanks, Chad. We do think this is an attractive 
transaction for Baker Hughes and BJ's stockholders. It enables all the stockholders to participate in the upside. 
It's an 85% stock deal, 15% cash deal as modeled. And we also expect accretion in 2011 as we said in our press 
release. 
Baker Hughes will maintain a robust balance sheet, this does not stress the balance sheet of the combined 
company. We will maintain our strong credit ratings, these have been affirmed last week by the rating agencies. 
And we have the capacity to consider other opportunities. We have high cash balances between the two 
companies, we've got $1 billion in undrawn credit facilities, we have access to the capital markets at attractive 
rates. And we believe there are plenty of cost savings opportunities from eliminating redundant expenses. 
In terms of the deal mechanics, these were in the press release, but we're exchanging 0.40035 shares of Baker 
Hughes and $2.69 in cash per share of BJ Services, approximately 117 million new BHI shares to be issued 
which means BJ Services stockholders will own about 27.5% of the combined company. 
In terms of governance, we have agreed that two of BJ Services Board members will join the Baker Hughes 
Board of Directors. And as Chad said, we hope to get the deal closed by the end of the year. And of course that's 
dependent on the customary regulatory reviews. And we hope there are no delays there. 
In terms of the synergies, there are several buckets, if you will, major buckets of where we think the synergies 
come from. Early on much of it will come from corporate overhead, more traditional areas of synergies. There will 
be plenty of scope for property consolidation in terms of operating bases around the world as well as domestic, 
regional sales offices. We also see opportunities in the non-pressure pumping businesses as well, as Chad talked 
about. 
We also see rationalization of overlapping field resources and this basically means we won't need duplicate 
support functions as we move to the geo market structure over time. The total annual savings estimated, and

Page 23 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
these are based on readily identifiable opportunities, are $75 million in 2010, and $150 million in 2011. And as our 
integration teams get to understand the overlaps and the revenue synergies potential we would expect these 
numbers to increase and or be pulled forward. And those teams are just getting underway now. 
So we've been working on a lot prior to this acquisition; let me just walk through some of those for those of you 
who may not be as familiar with Baker Hughes as we are. But we expect to exit the downturn a much stronger 
company. The actions we've already been implementing are the geographic reorg which we announced in May, I 
think it was May 4 and that's undergoing and been pretty smooth so far. 
In terms of people strategy we've added a number of key executives in the past 12 months or so. A new head of 
the Eastern Hemisphere came in a couple of months ago. We just announced last week a new head of our Middle 
East geo market. We've also brought in four other enterprise-level functions on technology, reliability, we brought 
in a CIO and we brought in a supply-chain executive. And these are six big hires that we've made in the past 12 
months and these people are very aggressive in showing a lot of opportunity to us from taking enterprise 
approach to a loss of our previous division focus to functions. 
We have reduced the size of our workforce to meet the current market conditions. Roughly about 4,000 net down 
from year end. We've embarked on a program in shared services organizations, we began it last year when times 
were still good; it's a multiyear process but we're making big changes to our HR organization and our finance 
organization to reduce those costs. We've closed and consolidated a lot of facilities and that will continue. 
And in terms of supply chain and information technology, these new strategies are being developed by these new 
enterprise wide teams. In terms of optimizing the product portfolio, Chad started out this way and I'll end this way. 
We've made four acquisitions in the Reservoir Technology Group, GCA, GMI, EPIC and Helix. And just the latest 
but certainly the largest in a series of positive steps has been the BHI BJS merger. With that I'll turn it over to Jim 
for questions. 
JIM CRANDELL: Okay, thank you, Peter. Do we have any questions? 
UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you very much for a very good explanation of why you're doing this 
deal. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about why you're doing it now. I mean, you obviously have had 
opportunities in the past. And is there some message in there about your perception of the gas market in North 
America going forward? And your point about it being accretive in 2011, can you tell a little bit of about your gas 
price assumptions behind that and what would happen if gas stayed where it was today? 
CHAD DEATON: Why now? I don't think any of us are smart enough to know exactly where the bottom is on 
activity. Clearly a year ago it wasn't there or two years ago, valuations were extremely, extremely high. I've been 
asked the question for the last four years since I've come into the Company, when are you going to get into 
pressure pumping and specifically questions when are you going to buy BJ or one that these others? 
And looking at it in the past we just felt that the valuations were too high and it didn't make some sense and we 
wanted to do some other things on the reservoir first. We wanted to do some things along with geographical 
organization and when the time was right we felt it would be time to jump in. I don't think we are necessarily all the 
way through to the bottom it yet, definitely not in North America. 
I think internationally the oil prices holding in there. We're still fighting significant declines in major fields around 
the world. So oil I think is going to recover and start coming back in 2010. And again, a lot of this acquisition 
wants to position us strongly on the international side in integrated operations and in that area. 
Domestically I have no doubt, and I said it in the presentation, we're in a time when there's going to be have to be 
some consolidation, there's going to have to be some shake outs. 
I believe that gas is going to play a strong role in the US and Canada in the future. At $2 gas, if it stays there for 
the next five years it's going to be a problem, no doubt, in North America. It won't be just for us. The service 
companies out there in North America today cannot operate, there won't be any wells drilled at $2 gas. So that 
means there's got to be something, a breakthrough in terms of other energy or technology or something that 
offsets that. 
We look at the declines, yes, the Haynesville and Marcellus come on strongly, but we don't know yet how they're 
going to decline. They do decline significantly and that's going to be played out over time. We didn't assume a 
significant activity increase in 2010 when we looked at the dilution in 2010 and accretive in 2011. In fact, through 
2011 we show a modest increase in rig count and growth.

Page 24 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Partly we believe that due to consolidation and contraction and eventually pricing have to rise, we see this 
business, fracking business returning just like it has in the past to be a profitable business and a good business 
for a certain number of companies to be in. It you can't have 17 in it, but you can clearly have three or four in it. 
And I think that will happen in time. People can't continue to operate losing cash or losing money that they're 
operating at today. There's going to have to be a reckoning so (multiple speakers). 
PETER RAGAUSS: Yes, I'll just add on the 2010 versus 2011 assumptions. We have assumed that the current 
rig count is unsustainably low so we have assumed a modest increase in the back half of 2011 leading into -- 
sorry, back half of 2010 maybe leading into 2011. So that's the basic assumption, that there will be slightly more 
rig activity in 2011 than there is today. 
UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: In the back, Chad, Peter. Peter, as you highlighted, the Company's going 
through a fairly significant internal realignment, Chad and Peter, can you both speak how you're going to absorb a 
fairly sizable company? Is that disruptive? Is it opportunity? How do you just explain it? How you're managing its. 
CHAD DEATON: Well, I think it's an opportunity actually because we are going through a lot and taking our 
product line focus to a geographical focus. We are quite a ways down the path of the geographical side, the 
people are in place. We're in the process of optimizing it which is going to take a quarter or two. We've had a 
huge response from our clients, tremendous response internationally from the customers, they love it. I can't think 
of hardly any negatives that have come out of our client base. 
Our people are excited about it, internationally especially, where they see that we needed to have a stronger face 
going in to Norway or Equatorial Guinea or whatever is a stronger company. We see that, yes, this is a company 
that we have to roll in, but we don't have a lot of overlapping areas. We think that some of the synergies that 
Peter talked about will make sense. 
Already BJ as felt the pressure of not being included in certain operations or projects domestically as well is 
internationally because their competitors bring a bigger package or offer a perforating service at a discount or for 
free if they get the frac job, it puts pressure on them. 
So I think that the will from the people are there to make it happen and I think that our reorg organization from an 
operation side has gone, again, quite smoothly. And by the time we do take this on we're going to have seven, 
eight months under our belt from the reorg and the geo markets are established. So I think we'll handle it. 
PETER RAGAUSS: Yes, I would just say we were, in fact, discussing this yesterday with our integration kick off. 
The geo market in itself is -- the geo market reorganization is putting together six or seven product lines under 
general managers. And as Chad said, after seven or eight months we will have had that experience. And then 
when we think about the BJ operations we'll be adding one more to that mix which will be a more powerful mix. 
And so we will have gone through that experience starting last May. And we don't view this as particularly 
disruptive, in fact it will only strengthen each manager' arsenal, if you will, to attack the market. 
UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible) the case for North American pricing improvement and 
pressure pumping seems to be, if I hear you correctly, that things are so bad they just can't continue at this rate. 
But if utilization is less than 50% going forward, you have 13 publicly traded companies still in the business as 
well as at least one big private and some smaller privates. 
And then you have a customer base that, although I hear you emphasizing the technology, some of the major 
customers do view this as a commodity and care about new equipment and new equipment only. I mean if that's 
the backdrop that you're operating in what are the chances that you might have to slug this out at current prices 
for the next three to four years? 
CHAD DEATON: Well, I think we'll have to slug it out at current prices. I don't see how it can last three to four 
years because I don't know what's going to keep a Halliburton or a Schlumberger continuing to rebuild equipment 
and put it in at a loss. It's just not going to happen. And the smaller players are going to have to have some kind 
of cash flow in order to be able to replace equipment. 
So we've heard it from BJ, we also heard it both from Schlumberger as well as Halliburton on various calls in that 
the Haynesville and Marcellus is very tough on equipment. And when you look at it it makes sense. You're putting 
frac horsepower out on a location and not moving it for a month. And traditionally all the time that horsepower 
would roll back to the facility somewhere and a night crew of mechanics would come in and completely go 
through the truck and get it ready, the drivers would come out the next morning and drive somewhere else and 
frac a different well.

Page 25 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The maintenance is a challenge, it's an issue. So as you go through this equipment and cannibalize it, which 
people are tending to do if they don't have the where for all to rebuild it, it's going to take its toll. And I just don't 
think it's going to take four years for it to happen. Is it going to take a few more quarters? Possibly. 
JIM CRANDELL: Okay. Thank you very much. We'll have a breakout session down at the Riverside suite. Thank 
you. 
CHAD DEATON: Thank you.

TALES OF THE TAPE: Baker Looks To Shake Post-Bid Stock Slump 
TALES OF THE TAPE: Baker Looks To Shake Post-Bid Stock Slump 
By Brian Baskin 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

(c) 2009 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) shares took a hit after the company made a bid for a smaller 
rival, but the oilfield services company is betting on a big comeback next year. 
The proposed acquisition of BJ Services Co. (BJS) is Baker Hughes' answer to critics who say the company is 
ill-equipped to compete for business outside its home base in North America. Although BJ Services does most of 
its business in the U.S. and Canada, its main product line, pumping chemicals down oil and gas wells to improve 
production, is one of the few major services Baker Hughes doesn't offer. 
The deal was widely praised by analysts, who see the combined company better competing with international 
giants Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) and Halliburton Co. (HAL) for lucrative, large-scale oil projects. Morgan Stanley's 
Ole Slorer called Baker Hughes "back in the game," increasing his 12-month share price target to $75 from $70 - 
and more than double the current price near $36. 
"We've always said we need to be in the top two or three," in any service Baker Hughes offers, said Chief 
Executive Chad Deaton at a Barclays Capital conference in New York on Wednesday. "We feel that's what 
clients will look at ... when you go into Saudi [Arabia] or Brazil." 
All that's still well off in the future, however. In the meantime, Baker Hughes is temporarily branding itself the 
oilfield services company most exposed to the cratering North American natural gas market. 
Truly globe-spanning oilfield services companies can spread their business between natural-gas producers, 
which make up the bulk of spending in the U.S. and Canada, and oil producers, which dominate outside North 
America. That distinction has become especially important this summer, as natural-gas prices have fallen more 
than 40% since May to below $3 a million British thermal units, their lowest point since 2002, while oil prices have 
held steady around $70 a barrel, a historically high price. 
Houston-based Baker Hughes said Aug. 31 that it would acquire BJ Services Co. for $5.5 billion in cash and 
stock. Baker Hughes' shares dropped more than 10% immediately after the announcement, and are still down 
over 5%, trading recently at $36. The company's stock is up 13% this year. 
Stocks often dip after a company makes an acquisition, though that hasn't been the case with other big oilfield 
services deals in recent years. Offshore driller Transocean Inc. (RIG) shares jumped 5.4% the day it announced a 
$15 billion bid for rival GlobalSantaFe in July 2007. Smith International Inc. (SII) shares fell 1.5% the day it 
announced a $3.2 billion bid for W-H Energy Services in June 2008, but recovered a day later. 
Image Rehab 
The company will need some time to shake its reputation as an also-ran outside North America, analysts said, 
explaining much of the drop in the company's share price. 
Baker Hughes' stock has begun to reflect a slowly mounting perception that the company is not as well-equipped 
to grow outside North America as Schlumberger or Halliburton, or even a smaller rival Weatherford Ltd. (WFT). 
All four companies provide a broad range of services to oil and natural-gas producers, ranging from seismic 
surveys of potential new fields to boosting production out of aging reserves.

Page 27 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"In terms of market share, they're still significantly behind Halliburton in North America, and Schlumberger 
globally," said Mark Brown, an analyst with Pritchard Capital Partners in New York. "They're still behind in terms 
of scale." 
The long-term outlook for Baker Hughes also depends on a recovery in North American gas demand, which some 
market participants see happening in the first half of next year, as the U.S. pulls out of recession. After the 
acquisition, Baker Hughes will earn 48% of its revenue from North America, compared with 43% at Halliburton 
and under 30% at Schlumberger and Weatherford, according to Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., an energy-focused 
investment bank in Houston. 
Before the slump, producers were increasingly focused on "unconventional" gas reserves, found in 
difficult-to-access rock formations. That trend is likely to continue as demand bounces back, benefiting oilfield 
services companies that offer a broad array of tools and techniques. 
"We're bullish on North American natural gas, and Baker with the acquisition of BJ is going to have even more 
exposure to that market," said Joe Hill, an analyst with Tudor Pickering.

Baker Hughes Banks on Shale Gas in BJ Services Deal

the weekly gas market newsletter 
Baker Hughes Inc.'s $5.5 billion cash-and-stock trade to acquire shale fracturing expert BJ Services Co. may be 
the largest oilfield services acquisition in more than 10 years, but it won't be the last oilpatch transaction this year, 
experts said last week. 
BJ Services is one of the largest pressure pumpers in the world, a process used in unconventional natural gas 
plays to break up rock. Pressure pumping now accounts for 75% of BJ Services' business; it is expected to be 
20% of the combined company's revenue. In 2008 pressure pumping accounted for 1% of Baker Hughes' 
revenue. 
The merger would give the combined company the ability to compete around the world, said Baker Hughes CEO 
Chad Deaton. Because of the complexity involved in drilling today, services companies often work together by 
"bundling" their service offerings. 
"While we are merging with BJ now, as the industry consolidates, we see opportunities to grow, both in individual 
shale markets in North America and in the rest of the world in the future, and in deepwater drilling," said Deaton. 
"We've begun discussing the next step to integrate the business. We know each other; our organizations have 
worked closely with each other... 
"Our two companies have highly complementary products and services with very little overlap," he told energy 
analysts during a conference call. "Baker Hughes has a long record of partnering with BJ Services on major 
projects. The proposed merger will make Baker Hughes a stronger, more efficient service provider for our 
customers worldwide, by integrating pressure pumping with Baker Hughes' wide range of products and services." 
The impetus to merge was a natural, Deaton explained. The two companies began talking about possibly 
merging around two months ago, and the companies reached an agreement in the wee hours last Monday (Aug. 
31), he said. 
Companies with an array of oilfield services have an edge worldwide, said BJ Services CEO Bill Stewart. 
"We are seeing many of the pressure pumping jobs are being bundled into larger integrated projects," Stewart 
said during the conference call. By combining services, Baker Hughes expects annual cost savings of about $75 
million in 2010 and $150 million in 2011. 
"BJ Services broadens our portfolio by adding products, technologies and talented people that are key to helping 
our customers unlock value in their reservoirs, particularly in unconventional gas and deepwater fields," said 
Deaton. "It will better position us to drive international growth and to compete for the growing large integrated 
projects by incorporating pressure pumping into our product offering." 
The transaction also is a bet that natural gas will play a bigger role internationally. 
"We think the conventional type opportunities are the main driver" for the transaction today, said Deaton. "But 
U.S. unconventional gas will get bigger and prices will rebound. Down the line overseas these shale plays will 
come on, but three or four years down the line." Baker Hughes expects to see "some recovery" in gas rig drilling 
in 2010, but "not real aggressive." 
Baker Hughes is "doing the right thing at generally the right time," said Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities Inc. 
(TPH). There is a "clear operational fit," and the merger makes Baker Hughes "more competitive as pressure 
pumping is currently a gaping hole" when bidding for international work and bundled U.S. services. The merger 
"puts more on the plate while in the middle of transitioning to a geomarket organization..."

Page 29 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Baker Hughes would move into the No. 3 spot in market value behind oilfield services leaders Schlumberger Ltd. 
and Halliburton Co. National Oilwell Varco Inc. is now the No. 3 oilfield services provider. Based on closing stock 
market prices for Aug. 28, BJ Services stockholders would receive 0.40035 shares of Baker Hughes stock and 
$2.69 in cash for each share they own. Once the merger is completed, BJ Services shareholders would own 
more than a quarter stake in Baker Hughes, and two of its board members would join Baker Hughes' board. The 
transaction requires regulatory approvals, and it also requires approvals from both companies' shareholders. 
Morningstar analysts said they had "long anticipated such a deal between the two companies, as it fills major 
holes in both product lines and makes a great deal of strategic sense. Baker Hughes will be better able to 
compete by offering a more complete bundled services offering, which could help it win international integrated 
project-management efforts. The deal gives BJ Services' pressure pumping operations a bigger global platform, 
and probably makes reentering Russia a much more palatable option." 
Some BJ Services shareholders were unhappy with the merger price offered; the share price has fallen by more 
than half in the past year. Stewart was asked why the company would agree to a merger with gas prices so low. 
"We've been consistent in our belief that there is a tremendous surplus of natural gas," said Stewart. "We are 
doing well in a competitive North American market, but we don't expect to see a rebound real soon unless we get 
some consolidation [in the industry]. We do think there'll be some capacity come out of the market...wear and 
tear, if you will, from shale formations wearing on equipment. Demand is down, significantly, and that is 
contributing to an extended period of market recovery. 
"What BJ Services needs is a broader scope of product offering, and what BJ Services needs is a better 
position than what we currently have in the marketplace. What BJ Services needs is products, services other 
than pressure pumping. It just so happens that now is when Baker Hughes decided they were interested, and it 
fills a tremendous void in their service offering, and it makes us more competitive throughout the world. 
"You can't pick and choose the exact time that a combination comes together," Stewart said. "It just so happens 
that now is the time, and it's a good deal for both sets of stockholders." 
Deaton said he doesn't think his company's merger announcement will be the last of the year. There is "a lot of 
talk" about more acquisitions in the oil and gas business, he said. "We haven't seen any deals yet, but there's lots 
of chat." 
Gerson Lehrman Group analyst Michael Lynch said the transaction "continues the trend toward the creation of 
super-sized oilservice companies that began during the long oil industry slump of the 1980s. While the major 
international oil companies continue to be primary sources of work for these huge companies, over the last two 
decades, mega-contracts with national oil companies have become equally important... 
"Today, nearly all development wells require horizontal laterals and most are fractured for completion," said 
Lynch. "BJ Services is a leader in this technology and in addition has expertise in the drilling fluid business. Both 
of these abilities strengthen Baker Hughes. The international oil and gas business is set to recover faster than the 
general economies of the world. It is probably not the end of the consolidation." 
Domestic gas shale drilling is forecast to jump 50% or more in 2010, even though overall gas activity will be up by 
only half that (23%), said TPH analysts last week. 
"We expect [the] total U.S. rig count to grow 55% over the course of 2010" from an estimated 968 rigs in the last 
three months of 2009 to 1,500 by the end of 2010, said TPH. However, U.S. drilling activity isn't expected to 
increase much beyond 4Q2010 levels, said the TPH analysts. The 2011 year/year (y/y) increase is seen as 
"mostly a full year of the 2010 recovery." 
Because of the increased use of hydraulic fracturing on shale wells, TPH analysts think there is a "better recovery 
outlook" for pressure pumping than for drilling rigs. The coming years' forecast is "gas price dependent," said the 
TPH team. "We are confident 2010 gas prices will rise from current levels, but if it doesn't reach our $7.50/Mcf 
forecast level, activity and oil service earnings could under perform our expectations." Exploration and production 
companies also may not cooperate and could "sit on their hands more than we expect as [the] gas price 
improves," said the analysts. "If this happens, gas price is biased higher than we expect, while an oil service 
earnings recovery would be delayed." 
Analysts with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey/the Gerdes Group (STRH) agreed that companies are producing 
more gas with fewer rigs. According to the STRH analysts, fundamentals support a $7/Mcf gas price in 2010 and 
an $8 gas price in 2011. The U.S. gas rig count "needs to increase almost 15% next year to 900 rigs on average

Page 30 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
to maintain gas market balance, which is below our prior expectation of 975 gas rigs," wrote STRH analysts. "The 
lower level of rig activity next year is attributable to better-than-expected well/rig productivity." 
This year "we anticipate a 30%-plus increase in well/rig productivity, which compounds the 24% increase 
experienced in '08," said the STRH team. "Consequently, we now forecast a shallower U.S. gas production 
decline of almost 3 Bcf/d (5%) y/y by year-end and nearly 5 Bcf/d (8%) peak-to-trough decline by next summer. In 
'11, a 20%-plus increase in drilling activity (1,100 average gas rig count) appears necessary to increase 
production sufficiently to maintain gas market equilibrium."

Takeover of BJ Services brings sought-after skills under wing 
HOUSTON-based drilling services provider Baker Hughes is set to take on industry giants Schlumberger and 
Halliburton with its $5.5 billion acquisition of cross-town oilfield contractor BJ Services. 
Both boards approved the definitive merger agreement and company officials expect the deal to close by the end 
of the year pending regulatory clearance and shareholder approval. 
The agreement represents a 16.3% premium to BJ Services stockholders over the closing price of BJ Services 
stock on ?28 August. 
BJ Services stockholders will receive 0.40035 shares of Baker Hughes and $2.69 cash in exchange for each 
share of BJ Services common stock. 
Upon closing, and reflecting the issuance of new Baker Hughes shares, BJ Services stockholders will own about 
27.5% of Baker Hughes' outstanding shares. 
The Baker Hughes board will also expand to include two BJ Services board members. 
Baker Hughes chief executive Chad Deaton and BJ Services chief executive Bill Stewart described the merger 
as a complementary fit resulting in a broader array of products and services. 
Their combined strength is also expected to "better position us to drive international growth and to compete for 
the growing large integrated projects by incorporating pressure pumping into our product offering", said Deaton. 
Baker Hughes evidently cherished BJ Services' pressure pumping operations. BJ is number three in the 
pressure pumping sector behind Halliburton and Schlumberger, but such operations accounted for less than 1% 
of Baker Hughes' revenues in 2008. Now it is expected to generate about 20% of the combined company's 
revenues. 
The number of fields requiring pressure pumping is expected to grow, not only in North America but 
internationally, where Baker Hughes has a larger presence. 
In a conference call with investors following the merger disclosure, Deaton described pressure pumping as a 
"must-have capability". 
He said it can account for as much as 50% of a customer's total drilling costs, especially for unconventional wells 
in shale. 
Stewart also noted that pressure pumping is just one of a number of services being requested by customers to be 
bundled into larger, more integrated contracts. However, both officials appeared to downplay the agreement as 
an imminent sign of a rebound in the oil and gas industry, especially in North America. 
Stewart said there still remains a "tremendous surplus of natural gas" in North America and hence he does not 
expect a resurgence in drilling activity "unless we get some expedited consolidation" in the industry.

Page 32 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
However, some capacity in the market will come out he predicted, due to the extreme "wear and tear" from shale 
drilling. 
Analysts gave a mixed response to the deal. James Crandall with Barclays suggested that the deal could have 
been done with a lesser or no premium at all, and while accepting that pressure pumping will bolster Baker 
Hughes' product line, "we would not think that this will make a large difference in the company's ability to win 
large integrated projects". 
Meanwhile, a research note put out by analysts Tudor Pickering Holt called the deal "sensible". 
"Oilfield services' most obvious merger and acquisition transaction has finally happened," the investment 
company said. 
Layoffs will undoubtedly be a part of the merger, as Baker Hughes expects to realise annual cost savings of about 
$75 million in 2010 and $150 million in 2011. Sales offices and other facilities will also be consolidated over time. 
Baker Hughes expects the combination to be accretive to earnings per share in 2011. 
Should the deal fail to be consummated, the agreement calls for a break-up fee of $175 million. 
Goldman, Sachs is acting as Baker Hughes's financial adviser and Greenhill & Co is acting as BJ Services's 
financial adviser and rendered a fairness opinion to the board. Bank of America Merrill Lynch Securities also 
rendered a separate fairness opinion to BJ's board.

U.S.-based oilfield services company Baker Hughes has announced that it is to merge with BJ Services in a deal 
worth US$5.5 billion. A definitive merger agreement was signed by the boards of both companies on Monday (31 
August) and will see BJ Services shareholders receiving 0.40035 shares in Baker Hughes and cash of US$2.69 
in exchange for each share of BJ Services common stock. Upon deal close, and following the issuance of new 
Baker Hughes shares, BJ Services shareholders will own approximately 27.5% of Baker Hughes outstanding 
shares. 
Describing the products and services offered by both companies as "highly complementary with little overall", 
Baker Hughes CEO Chad Deaton explained that the deal enhanced his firm's "position as a top-tier global oilfield 
services companybroadening our portfolio by adding products, technologies and talented people that are key to 
helping our customers unlock value in their reservoirs, particularly in unconventional gas and deepwater 
fields".Significance: The merger is expected to offer operational synergies yielding annual savings of around 
US$75 million per year by 2010, and US$150 million per year by 2011, and will moreover expand the pressure 
pumping business within Baker Hughes to nearly 20% of the combined firm's revenues, up from just 1% last year. 
From a strategy perspective, the deal seems primarily geared to placing Baker Hughes in an advantageous 
position ahead of an expected resurgence in natural gas drilling, primarily from unconventional gas formations. At 
present, the North American gas industry has suffered from low demand from a weak economy, along with 
surging gas inventories, prompting prices to drop quite markedly relative to highs reached in the middle of last 
year. As a result, drillers have cut back on rigs and producers have cut both investments and output. With this 
deal, Baker Hughes appears to be banking on a medium-term recovery in both prices and industry activity. There 
is little doubt the move itself will prompt other oilfield services players to reassess their own competitive positions, 
so we may yet see further industry consolidation in the months ahead.

Oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc. said Monday that it will buy BJ Services Co. in a cash-and-stock 
deal valued at $5.5 billion that the company said will allow it to drive international growth and compete for projects 
of companies engaged in all phases of the oil business. 
The acquisition is expected to produce $75 million in cost savings for Baker Hughes in 2010 and $150 million in 
2011, and add to earnings per share in 2011. Baker Hughes Chairman, President and CEO Chad C. Deaton said 
in a statement that the transaction will particularly help customers with unconventional gas and deepwater fields. 
It will better position us to drive international growth and to compete for the growing large integrated projects by 
incorporating pressure pumping into our product offering, he added. Integrated oil companies are active in all 
phases of the business including production, refining, transportation and marketing. Pressure pumping made up 
less than 1 percent of Baker Hughes 2008 revenue, but is expected to comprise about 20 percent of the 
company's revenue after the deal is complete. BJ stockholders will receive 0.40035 shares of Baker Hughes and 
$2.69 in cash for each share they own. The deal represents a 16.3 percent premium to BJ's $15.43 Friday closing 
stock price, the companies said.

Oil and natural gas drilling consultant Baker Hughes Inc. said Monday it plans to acquire rival BJ Services Co. for 
$5.5 billion, saying the merger will enable more than $200 million in savings and synergies over two years and 
better position the firm to compete for large integrated projects in the growing deepwater and shale gas sectors. 
The deal combines Baker Hughes formidable army of engineers and global presence with BJ Services (BJS)

The deal will give BJS shareholders a 16.3 percent premium on their stock compared to Fridays closing price. 
BJS stockholders collectively will own approximately 27.5 percent of Baker Hughes outstanding shares. 
Baker Hughes officials see the merged entity generating a much larger chunk of its revenue from pressure 
pumping, which, like hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting water and other fluids underground to break open 
seams and cracks to more easily suck up oil and gas.

Baker Hughes fills a gap with BJ Services deal

Baker Hughes fills a gap with BJ Services deal

The Wall Street Journal Europe

Baker Hughes Inc. agreed to acquire BJ Services Co. for $5.5 billion, in an effort to create a new rival to global 
oilfield-service giants Schlumberger Ltd. and Halliburton Co. 
Monday's cash-and-stock deal, which company executives said could be completed by the end of the year, fills a 
key gap in Baker Hughes's offerings that had put it at a disadvantage compared with its larger rivals. BJ Services 
specializes in pressure pumping, in which a combination of water and chemicals are injected into a well to 
increase production. 
The deal is the first major merger in the oilfield-services sector since energy prices collapsed last year. Industry 
experts have predicted for months that the drop in prices would lead to a wave of transactions as larger 
companies snapped up weakened smaller players. But the deals have largely failed to materialize, at least in part 
because companies haven't been able to agree on how much assets are worth. 
Monday's announcement is a sign that the gap between buyers' and sellers' expectations is finally narrowing. 
After falling for much of the year, the number of drilling rigs operating in the U.S. has begun to creep upward in 
recent weeks, indicating oilfield activity already has reached its lowest point. That could spur more potential 
buyers to act before values start rising again. 
"We've heard a lot of companies talking about how North America is bottoming. Maybe the timing is right," said 
Mark Brown, an analyst with Pritchard Capital Partners in New York. 
But analysts also said Baker Hughes and BJ Services, both based in Houston, are uniquely well-matched, and 
few predicted a sudden surge in deals. The recovery in oil prices to more than $70 a barrel from less than $35 a 
barrel last December has taken some of the pressure off weaker companies. 
"There isn't a lot of obvious low-hanging fruit," said Simmons &Co. analyst Bill Herbert. 
For Baker Hughes, the third-largest Western energy services company by 2008 revenue, Monday's deal 
represents a chance to take advantage of two recent trends in the global energy industry. In recent years, 
pressure pumping has emerged as a key technology needed to tap huge new natural-gas fields that have been 
discovered in North America and elsewhere around the world. Meanwhile, state-run oil companies and global 
giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. are increasingly seeking to hire contractors that can 
oversee projects from start to finish -- giving an advantage to companies that offer a full range of services. 
Baker Hughes has largely missed out on both trends because it hasn't had the full range of services, including 
pumping, offered by its larger rivals. 
"As time went on, they were going to become more and more marginalized," said Simmons's Mr. Herbert. 
Merging the two companies "is making us much more competitive as we go after all these complex projects 
around the world," said Baker Hughes Chief Executive Chad Deaton, in a conference call with investors. 
Baker Hughes's acquisition, which must still be approved by both companies' shareholders, is actually a 
recombination. Baker Hughes spun off BJ Services as a separate company in 1991 in an effort to focus on its 
core drilling business.

Page 38 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
But the industry has changed since the two Houston-based companies split, and a reunification had long been 
rumored. 
The deal carries risks for Baker Hughes. BJ Services does most of its business in the U.S., at a time when Baker 
has been trying to emphasize its international operations. Mr. Herbert and other analysts said one key to making 
the deal work would be Baker's ability to export BJ's technology to foreign markets, where drilling activity has 
generally held up better than in the U.S. 
In recent years, BJ Services has emerged as a leader in hydraulic fracturing, a technology that allows oil and, in 
particular, natural gas to be produced from dense rock formations. 
New fracturing technologies developed by the company and others have helped fuel a boom in natural-gas 
production in North America. Industry experts expect similar techniques to spread to other continents in coming 
years. 
Following news of Monday's deal, Baker Hughes shares were down 10% at $34.30 in late-afternoon New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading, suggesting that investors think the pricetag for BJ Services is too high. 
BJ Services holders shareholders will get $2.69 in cash and 0.40035 share of Baker Hughes for each BJ 
Services share. That values BJ Services at a 16% premium to Friday's closing price. BJ shareholders will own 
slightly more than one-quarter of the combined company. 
Most analysts said the price seemed reasonable. BJ Services shares are down more than 40% from their 
52-week high as lower natural-gas prices have led to less drilling activity and less demand for its services. The 
company reported a $32.3 million loss for its fiscal third quarter ended June 30, compared with a $141.8 million 
profit a year earlier.

oil & gas 
Baker Hughes, the oilfield services provider, said yesterday it would buy oil pumping company BJ Services for 
$5.5bn in cash and stock to gain a foothold in the market for pressure pumping, which helps drillers extract more 
oil from ageing wells. 
The deal will boost the size of Baker Hughes' pressure pumping business to provide more than 20 per cent of its 
revenue, from less than 1 per cent today. 
The move puts it more in line with larger rivals Schlumberger and Halliburton, who derive an even greater 
proportion of their revenue from pressure pumping. 
Houston-based Baker Hughes will pay 0.40035 of a share of its own stock plus $2.69 in cash for each share of 
BJ Services - a 16 per cent premium to BJ Services' closing price last week. 
BJ Services shareholders will own 27.5 per cent of the combined company. 
Chad Deaton, chairman and chief executive of Baker Hughes, said in an interview that the companies signed the 
deal just hours before announcing the transaction yesterday morning, after talking about a transaction for several 
months. 
Baker Hughes once owned BJ Services but spun it off in the early 1990s. 
Mr Deaton said he expected oil and gas service companies to become increasingly integrated worldwide, and 
called BJ Services' pressure pumping and deepwater oil well capabilities "key components" of Baker Hughes' 
own integration effort. 
Pressure pumping services are in increasingly high demand as oilfields age worldwide and require enhanced 
technology to keep producing. 
"It has been a gap in our portfolio for quite some time," said Mr Deaton. 
Baker Hughes considered building its own pressure pumping business, he said, but felt it would be a challenge 
compared with buying BJ Services, the third-largest pressure pumper in the world. 
Industry analysts have been anticipating a round of mergers and acquisitions since the oil and gas sector took a 
combined hit from the economic downturn, the credit squeeze, and falling commodity prices. 
Valuing assets has been difficult, however, amid insecurity about oil and gas prices and the length of the 
downturn. 
A string of US natural gas producers have been forced into bankruptcy this year or into asset sales by their 
banks, which used annual reviews of some companies' debt to cut their permissible debt levels below existing 
borrowings.

Page 40 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Foreign companies have sensed opportunity in a US market desperate for cash, forming partnerships with small 
US natural gas companies that have provided them with acreage and expertise in big, new gas fields for billions 
of dollars. 
"I think our customers are feeling comfortable that oil looks a little better internationally," said Mr Deaton. He 
expected the US gas market, on the other hand, to remain challenging this year and next.

Oilfield service company Baker Hughes said yesterday it was to acquire smaller rival BJ Services in a 
£3.33billion cash and shares deal. 
The two US-based companies employ more than 2,000 people in the Aberdeen area, but with little overlap 
between their products and services any impact on jobs in the north-east is likely to be minimal. 
Baker says it expects to realise annual cost savings of about £45.5million next year and £91million in 2011 as it 
eliminates redundant costs, consolidates facilities, and trims field expenses. 
A spokesman said it was unlikely two corporate headquarters in Houston would be required and there might be 
some senior management and back-office rationalisation following the acquisition. 
On closing, and after new Baker Hughes shares are issued, BJ Services stockholders will own about 27.5% of 
Baker Hughes's shares. 
Baker chief executive Chad Deaton said: BJ Services broadens our portfolio by adding products, technologies 
and talented people that are key to helping our customers unlock value in their reservoirs, particularly in 
unconventional gas and deepwater fields. 
It will better position us to drive international growth and to compete (with oilfield service giants Schlumberger 
and Halliburton) for the growing large integrated projects by incorporating pressure pumping into our product 
offering. 
Our two companies have highly complementary products and services with very little overlap. 
Bill Stewart, CEO at BJ Services, said: We are very pleased to be joining forces with Baker Hughes and believe 
that this is an attractive combination for customers, employees, and BJ Services' stockholders. 
Although pressure pumping accounted for less than 1% of Baker Hughes's revenue in 2008, it is expected to 
generate about 20% of the combined group's income. 
The deal is subject to the approval of both companies' stockholders, but the firms anticipate that the transaction 
could close as soon as the end of this year. 
BJ Services is a provider of pressure-pumping, well-completion, production-enhancement and pipeline services. 
It has more than 16,000 employees in 50 countries worldwide  including 600-plus working in the Aberdeen area 
 and more than £3billion in annual revenue. 
Baker Hughes provides reservoir consulting, drilling, formation evaluation, completion and production products 
and services. 
It employs 36,000 people in 90 countries and in 2008 had revenue of £7.2billion. It has around 1,600 workers in 
the north-east.

The $5.5-billion US pairing of American oilfield services giants Baker Hughes and BJ Services creates an 
international player capable of tackling Canada's unconventional shale gas deposits, observers said Monday. 
The merger of the Texasbased rivals combines BJ's pressure pumping services --a critical step in performing the 
multistage fracturing needed to release natural gas from shale--with Baker Hughes'reservoir engineering and 
technology development capabilities, company representatives said. 
"Pressure pumping is a major item in many of today's E&P (exploration and production) projects, which makes it 
what we call a must-have capability for the top tier of the diversified international oilfield services companies," 
Baker Hughes president Chad Deaton told a conference call with analysts. "This is especially true for 
unconventional wells, where pressure pumping can account for half the customer's expenditure." 
"We're finding that many of the pressure pumping jobs are being bundled into larger integrated projects," added 
BJ CEO Bill Stewart. "As part of Baker Hughes, we'll be able to better position and to pursue business in respect 
to these new integrated projects." 
The deal is not expected to have a big impact in terms of job cuts on this side of the border, where BJ employs 
about 1,600 people. Although Baker Hughes is active in Canada, it had a much smaller presence than BJ prior to 
the deal. 
"In the big picture, this will allow Baker Hughes to offer more services and compete with Schlumberger and 
Halliburton," Blair Albers, BJ's vice-president of Canadian operations, told the Edmonton Journal. 
"I don't see there will be much, if any, change in Canada because we didn't compete against them with anything 
here," said Albers. 
Both companies have long and storied histories in the oilpatch. Baker Hughes was founded by Howard Hughes 
Sr. in 1909, while BJ was founded in 1872 by 31-year-old inventor Byron Jackson, who is credited with 
developing the submersible centrifugal pump. 
BJ bolstered its Canadian presence with the $750-million acquisition of Nowsco Well Services in 1996 and has a 
significant operations centre in Red Deer. With the acquisition, Baker Hughes will become the third-largest 
service company in the oilpatch. 
"BJ was a nice way for Baker Hughes to get a toe into Canada," said Tristone Capital analyst Jan Cerny. 
News of the deal sent shares of American service companies soaring, but the reaction was muted on this side of 
the border with Canada's two largest service firms each posting declines on the day--albeit smaller drops than the 
broader energy index. Flint Energy Services fell 11 cents to $10.32 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while Trican 
Well Service fell five cents to $10.14. 
Cerny said both companies could become takeover targets, particularly Trican, which has a large Russian 
division in addition to operations in Canada and the U. S. 
"It's certainly a possibility, but it would have to be a pretty big U. S. company that could afford to pay a significant 
premium."

Although the merged company is ideally suited to operate in emerging shale plays in Canada and the U. S., 
Deaton said large-scale shale gas development is still far off and wasn't part of the immediate rationale for doing 
the deal. 
"Down the line. I think these shale plays will come on, but I still think those are three, four years away probably." 
The deal comes at what some see as the bottom of the drilling market. Canadian rig activity is highly seasonal 
and starts to pick up in the fall, eventually peaking in the winter. Baker Hughes, which is noted for its weekly rig 
counts, reported on Friday that the number of active rigs in Canada rose by 20 to 184 active units for the week 
ended Aug. 28. However, that figure is down 252 rigs from the same period last year.

HOUSTON -- Baker Hughes Inc., seeking to cement its status as a top-tier energy-services company, agreed to 
acquire BJ Services Co. for $5.5 billion in cash and stock. 
The transaction, which company executives say could be completed as early as year-end, would give 
Houston-based Baker Hughes the ability to offer a full spectrum of oil-field services, as do larger rivals 
Schlumberger Ltd. and Halliburton Co. 
Crude-oil and natural-gas producers in the U.S. and abroad are showing an increasing preference for hiring 
contractors that can do everything from surveying potential hydrocarbon reservoirs to enhancing production from 
aging fields. 
The merger "is making us much more competitive as we go after all these complex projects around the world," 
Baker Hughes Chief Executive Chad Deaton said Monday in a conference call. 
The consolidation is expected to open more doors for Baker Hughes to major energy developments outside North 
America, which traditionally has been a major market for both Baker Hughes and BJ Services. Business in North 
America is biased toward exploration and production for natural gas, a sector that's likely to remain weak as 
prices have recently slumped to seven-year lows below $3 a million British thermal units. 
The acquisition "fills a compelling strategic need for BHI as [national oil companies] are calling for increasingly 
more, and not less, integration," Simmons &Co. analyst Bill Herbert said in a research note. 
Baker Hughes shares were down more than 8.5% at $34.80 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, 
a sign that investors were skeptical of the deal's price. 
BJ shareholders will get $2.69 in cash and 0.40035 share of Baker Hughes for each share of BJ held. That values 
BJ Services at a 16% premium to Friday's closing price. 
BJ shareholders would own slightly more than one-quarter of the combined company. 
Mr. Herbert said in his note that the premium paid for BJ Services "isn't offensive," but it represents about 30 
times the company's projected earnings for next year. By 2011, the multiple will fall to 15 times earnings, 
compared with a projected multiple of 12 at Baker Hughes for that year, he said. 
Baker Hughes expects to realize annual cost savings from the merger of about $75 million next year and $150 
million in 2011. The combination is expected to add to its earnings per share in 2011. 
Both companies, like many in the oil patch, have been reporting slumping results lately amid a price plunge that is 
crimping production and exploration as demand wanes for oil and natural gas.

Baker Hughes to buy BJ Services for US$5.5bn to compete with biggest players 
Baker Hughes to buy BJ Services for US$5.5bn to compete with biggest players

Oil services company Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI) will purchase fellow Houston-based firm BJ Services (NYSE: 
BJS) for US$5.5bn in order to compete with service companies Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) and Halliburton 
(NYSE: HAL) for major integrated projects, Baker Hughes chairman, president and CEO Chad Deaton told a 
webcast on Monday. 
BJ Services is the third largest player in the global pressure pumping market behind Halliburton and 
Schlumberger, whereas pressure pumping accounted for less than 1% of Baker Hughes' revenues in 2008. 
By comparison in 2008 pressure pumping accounted for 29% and 37% of the top two firms' revenues, he said 
without specifying which figure corresponded to which company. 
"Pressure pumping is a major item in many of today's E&P projects, which makes it what we call a must-have 
capability for the top-tier diversified oilfield service companies. This combination will allow us to approach the 
level that you see in those two players," Deaton said. 
Following the merger, pressure pumping will account for some 20% of Baker Hughes' revenues, which the 
company says will better position it to compete for integrated projects. 
Baker Hughes has incorporated BJ's projects and services into some bids on major contracts in the past, 
including a roughly US$500mn offshore project and other onshore projects in Mexico, Deaton said. 
The merger will also disable Halliburton and Schlumberger from marketing their relative advantage over firms with 
fewer services, BJ's CEO, chairman and president Bill Stewart said. 
"The combined company will have an arsenal of services and products that are what I call very complete. The two 
major competitors have been trying to take an advantage over others because their service offering was more 
complete than BJ, Baker or others. So now this puts Baker in a position of being able to offer anything that any of 
the two other major competitors can offer, and it doesn't allow them to market an advantage," Stewart said. 
The boards of directors of both companies have approved the merger agreement, which involves both stock and 
cash, Baker Hughes said in a statement released earlier Monday. 
The price offered for the shares represents a 16.3% premium to BJ Services' stockholders over the August 28 
closing price, according to the statement. 
Upon closing of the transaction, and reflecting the issuance of new Baker Hughes shares, BJ stockholders will 
own roughly 27.5% of Baker Hughes' outstanding shares. 
Baker Hughes anticipates savings of US$75mn in 2010 and US$150mn in 2011 as it eliminates redundant costs, 
consolidates facilities, and further rationalizes field costs. 
Deaton said BJ would initially operate as a division within Baker Hughes, similar to the previous purchases of 
consultancies Gaffney Cline and GeoMechanics International (GMI), but on a larger scale. 
"BJ is going to operate as BJ. They've got their facilities, their bases, and in time these things will move together, 
but we're not trying to roll BJ immediately into the geo-market structure. We want these guys to do what they do, 
and they do it very well. As time goes on, the other synergies will come forward and eventually they'll fit in just like 
the other Baker Hughes product lines," Deaton said. 
The company expects the deal to add to profits by 2011, the statement said.

Baker Hughes' board will be expanded to include two BJ Services board members. 
The merger is subject to approval of both companies' stockholders and could close by year-end. 
Baker Hughes' shares closed down 9.56% at US$34.45 on Wall Street on Monday, effectively reducing the size of 
the deal to closer to US$4.9bn. BJ Services ended the day up 4.08% at US$16.06.

Oil Services Strikes First Big Deal Since 2008

The faltering economy has been bad news for the oil and gas business. Gas prices have fallen off more than 75% 
from their peaks last summer. But oil and gas producers have been upping the number of oil and gas rigs recently 
in the hopes that an economic recovery will boost energy demand. In the run-up to the recovery, Baker Hughes , 
the biggest producer of drilling hardware, struck a deal to buy oil and gas gear maker BJ Services for $5.5 billion. 
BJ Services specializes in hardware to extract oil and gas from shale, especially offshore. The acquisition will 
beef up the companys unconventional natural gas and deepwater businesses. 
Baker Hughes bought BJ Services at a 16.3% premium to its August 28 stock price. The companys chief 
executive Chad Deaton said in a statement that he hopes the acquisition will boost earnings in 2011, saving the 
company roughly $75 billion in 2010 and $150 million in 2011. Deaton said the deal will better position us to 
drive international growth and add pressure pumping into our product offering, a part of the business that now 
makes up less than 1% of Baker Hughes revenues. The BJ Services deals should boost pressure pumping 
(which involves pumping fluid down a well to increase the wells production) to roughly 20% of Baker Hughes 
business. 
Some analysts say natural gas could get a boost this winter because it is used to heat millions of U.S. homes. It is 
also the energy source for manufacturers, which are ramping up production in hope of a sustained economic 
recovery. 
Traders Eye Midwest Manufacturing Update 
A slew of reports on the state of manufacturing -- from Japan to Brazil to Russia to the U.S.  will be kicked off by 
a much more regionally focused one, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which comes out at 9:45 a.m. 
Economists use the Chicago PMI as a barometer for the overall business environment in the Midwest. 
The measure is based on a survey that asks purchasing managers of manufacturers whether business was better 
this month than last. That kind of data may sound insignificant to some market-watchers, but the Chicago PMI 
often hints at whats going to happen to the indexs national equivalent, the Institute for Supply Management's 
Manufacturing PMI, which comes out on Tuesday. The Chicago PMI, released on the last business day of each 
month, moves with the national index 91 percent of the time, according to market analysis website Briefing.com. 
Economists predict this months Chicago index will rise to 47.2, up from 43.4 in July. A reading of 50 or above 
indicates growth in manufacturing. Anything below 50 is a sign of contraction. The U.S. dollar strengthened 
against the euro after the release of last years August Chicago PMI, which jumped on an increase in new 
manufacturing orders. The index hit its lowest point ever in March but has been climbing steadily since then. 
In July, the Chicago PMI jumped up several points from June, an indication that the broader economy is starting 
to recover. The sub-categories of new orders and employment fared the best, while other categories, such as 
inventories, did worse. Analysts say cash-strapped businesses are still trying to get rid of old inventory before 
they start taking on more. The category is expected to have improved this month, with GM and Chryslers 
assembly lines up and running again. 
In Japan, Traders Waver After Election Results 
Emerging-market investors have been waiting years for Japans economy to pull out of its decade-long slump. 
Todays parliamentary elections results may give them a glimmer of hope. Japanese voters ousted the countrys 
ruling party in parliament, the Liberal Democratic Party, which had ruled almost unchallenged for the past 54

Page 49 of 67 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
years. The opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, won by a landslide, grabbing 308 of the 408 seats in 
Japans lower parliament, up from 115 seats previously. The LDP lost 181 seats, down from 300 before the 
election to 119. The Japanese stock market responded positively to election news at first; traders sent the Nikkei 
to its highest level since October. But the market ultimately ended down 0.4% after a spike in the Japanese yen. 
Analysts had been expecting the opposition win, which may explain the Japanese markets tepid performance 
later in the day. But the DPJs plans to reform the economy could lift Japanese stocks in the long-term 
because the party plans to dole out government funds as a stimulus, says Naoki Kamiyama, chief strategist at 
Deutsche Bank in Tokyo, according to an article published by MarketWatch Monday. 
For example, Honda Motor could get a boost from the partys plan to continue offering government incentives for 
buying hybrid cars. But some analysts say exporters may suffer if the DPJ allows the yen to strengthen against 
foreign currencies in its efforts to boost domestic demand. The yen rose against other currencies following the 
election news, weighing on shares of Honda Motor, which slid 1.8 %. Canon Inc., the worlds biggest digital 
camera-maker, dropped 3.3%.

New York (Platts)--31Aug2009/801 am EDT/1201 GMT (Updating with details) 
US oilfield services company Baker Hughes will acquire peer BJ Services in a deal valued at $5.5 billion, Baker 
Hughes said Monday. 
Under the terms of the agreement, BJ Services stockholders would receive 0.40035 of a Baker Hughes share 
and $2.69 in cash for each share of BJ Services. That represents a 16.3% premium over BJ Services' closing 
share price on Friday, Baker Hughes said. 
Once the deal closes, BJ Services stockholders would own roughly 27.5% of Baker Hughes. 
"BJ Services broadens our portfolio by adding products, technologies and talented people that are key to helping 
our customers unlock value in their reservoirs, particularly in unconventional gas and deepwater fields," Chad 
Deaton, chairman and CEO of Baker Hughes, said. "It will better position us to drive international growth and to 
compete for the growing large integrated projects by incorporating pressure pumping into our product offering." 
Baker Hughes said it expects to realize annual cost savings of about $75 million in 2010 and $150 million in 2011 
"as it eliminates redundant costs, consolidates facilities, and further rationalizes field costs." 
The deal is expected to be accretive to earnings per share in 2011, said Baker Hughes. 
The board of directors of Baker Hughes will be expanded to include two members of BJ Services' board. 
"We are very pleased to be joining forces with Baker Hughes and believe that this is an attractive combination for 
all of BJ Services' constituencies...," BJ Services chairman and CEO Bill Stewart said. 
The deal is subject to the approval of shareholders of both companies and normal regulatory approvals; the board 
of each company has already approved the deal, which Baker says could close by the end of the year. 
The companies have scheduled a conference call for 7:30 am CDT (12:30 GMT) to discuss the deal.

HOUSTON (Dow Jones)-- Baker Hughes Inc.'s (BHI) $5.5 billion acquisition of BJ Services Co. (BJS) will result 
in $75 million in savings next year, starting with the reduction of redundant corporate costs, a Baker Hughes 
executive said Monday. 
"Initial cost savings will occur in some of the corporate overhead," said Chief Financial Officer Peter Ragauss in a 
conference call with investors. Other cost savings will come from the consolidation of property and regional 
offices that have been operating separately, he said. 
"It will be a rolling cost savings that increases over time," Ragauss said. 
The merger of the two oil field service companies, the first big oil patch deal since the price of commodities began 
tumbling in mid-2008, will be gradual, Baker Hughes Chief Executive Chad Deaton said. 
"BJ is going to operate as BJ," Deaton said. "They've got their facilities, their bases. Over time these things will 
move together," he said. 
The deal, the executives said, was prompted by the need to offer oil companies a more comprehensive set of 
services when tackling major projects, in order to compete with larger service companies like Schlumberger Ltd 
(SLB) and Halliburton Co. (HAL). 
The "predominant benefit is going to be overseas," where most of these major projects are, said BJ Services 
chief executive Bill Stewart. 
Baker Hughes expects the transaction to be accretive to earnings per share in 2011. The company predicts a 
"modest" increase in rig count, CEO Deaton said.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Baker Hughes Inc. entered a definitive agreement to acquire BJ Services in a 
stock-and-cash transaction valued at $5.5 billion, the providers of oilfield services announced Monday. 
"Our two companies have highly complementary products and services with very little overlap," said Chad 
Deaton, chairman, president and chief executive of Houston-based Baker Hughes (BHI, US), which projects that 
the deal will begin contributing to earnings starting in 2011. 
The companies see a particular opportunity in pressure pumping -- a technique used to unlock the full value of 
underground reservoirs. The number of fields requiring pressure pumping services is expected to grow, especially 
outside of North America, they said. 
Terms of the merger call for BJ Services (BJS, US) shareholders to receive 0.40035 of a share of Baker Hughes 
as well as cash in the amount of $2.69 in exchange for each of their BJ Services common shares. 
The deal carries an acquisition premium of about 16%, based on the Aug. 28 closing price on BJ Services stock, 
which rallied in pre-market trading. 
The merger will be put to a vote of both companies' shareholders and requires other customary approvals. The 
companies anticipate that the transaction could close as soon as the end of 2009. 
The companies expect to realize cost synergies of $75 million in 2010 and $150 million in 2011. 
BJ Services shareholders would own about 27.5% of Baker Hughes' outstanding shares pending completion of 
the merger. 
Baker Hughes is acquiring BJ Services in a stock-and-cash transaction valued at $5.5 billion, as the providers of 
oilfield services hope to capitalize on opportunities to provide pressure-pumping services.

HOUSTON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Small U.S. oil services companies Superior Well Services Inc and RPC Inc rallied 
on Monday as investors speculated they might be takeover targets after a deal between larger rivals was 
announced. 
Earlier in the day, Baker Hughes said it planned to buy BJ Services Co for $5.5 billion in cash and stock. 
While Baker Hughes' takeover deal will not kick off a "massive merger wave," it will give shares of smaller 
pressure pumping companies a lift, energy research firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co said in a note to clients on 
Monday. 
Pressure pumping services are used to increase natural gas or oil production by pumping liquids or sand into 
wells. 
Shares of Superior Well Services were up 12.9 percent at $9.27 in afternoon Nasdaq trading. RPC climbed 10.3 
percent to $9.11 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
On a conference call to discuss the deal, Baker Hughes Chief Executive Officer Chad Deaton said there was lots 
of talk about consolidation in the sector. 
"I think there's going to be consolidation on the pressure pumping side," Deaton said. "This is still going to be a 
very good business (once the market recovers)." (Reporting by Anna Driver in Houston and Matt Daily in New

Baker Hughes, the oilfield services provider, said on Monday it would buy BJ Services, a smaller rival, for $5.5bn 
in cash and stock to broaden its selection of products and services 
Baker Hughes will pay 0.40035 of a share of its stock, plus $2.69 in cash, for each share of BJ Services, which 
represents a 16 per cent premium to BJ Services' closing price on Friday. 
Chad Deaton, chairman and chief executive of Baker Hughes, said in an interview that the companies signed the 
deal just a few hours before announcing the transaction on Monday morning after talking about a potential 
transaction for several months. Baker Hughes once owned BJ Services, but spun it off in the early 1990s. 
The purchase of BJ Services will significantly boost Houston-based Baker Hughes' ability to perform pressure 
pumping services, which are in increasingly high demand around the world as oilfields age and require stimulation 
to keep producing. 
Baker Hughes' pressure pumping business will jump from less than 1 per cent of its revenue to more than 20 per 
cent when the deal is completed. That is still less, on a percentage basis, than the amount of revenue larger rivals 
Schlumberger and Halliburton derive from pressure pumping. 
Baker Hughes shares were down 3.65% at $36.70 in pre-market trading in New York on Monday.

BJ Services To Be Acquired By Baker Hughes In $5.5 Billion (U.S.) Deal 
BJ Services To Be Acquired By Baker Hughes In $5.5 Billion (U.S.) Deal 
DOB/Reuters

31 August 2009

Baker Hughes Incorporated announced today it will acquire BJ Services Company, a combination of two 
companies that in 2008 had combined Canadian revenues of more than $1 billion (U.S.). 
The Houston-based companies announced that their boards of directors have approved a definitive merger 
agreement which represents a transaction value of $5.5 billion for BJ Services and a 16.3% premium to its 
shareholders based on the closing price Aug. 28. 
The acquisition will add pressure pumping to Baker Hughes' product line, making it a major North American 
player in pressure pumping and better positioning it to drive international growth in competing against Halliburton 
Co. and Schlumberger Ltd. for large integrated projects. 
For the first three quarters of 2009, BJ's Canadian pressure pumping services business reported revenue of 
$250.7 million, including $23.3 million in the third quarter, a 76% decline from the previous quarter. 
"The transaction further enhances Baker Hughes' position as a top-tier global oilfield services company," Chad 
Deaton, Baker Hughes chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a prepared statement. "BJ 
Services broadens our portfolio by adding products, technologies and talented people that are key to helping our 
customers unlock value in their reservoirs, particularly in unconventional gas and deepwater fields." 
The two companies have highly complementary products and services with very little overlap and Baker Hughes 
has a long record of partnering with BJ Services on major projects, he added. 
"We are very pleased to be joining forces with Baker Hughes and believe that this is an attractive combination for 
all of BJ Services' constituencies," said Bill Stewart, BJ's chairman, president and CEO. "Customers will benefit 
from our wider and better-integrated array of services and technologies; our employees will enjoy the advantages 
and opportunities of being a part of a larger, stronger company; and BJ Services' stockholders will have the 
opportunity to continue to participate in the success of the combined enterprise." 
Pressure pumping accounts for about 75% of BJ Services' revenues. Although pressure pumping accounted for 
less than one per cent of Baker Hughes' revenues in 2008, it is expected to generate approximately 20% of the 
combined company's revenues, providing Baker Hughes with revenues from pressure pumping that approaches 
its two largest competitors, Halliburton and Schlumberger. 
Pressure pumping has grown in importance as customers have looked for new ways to unlock the full value of 
their reservoirs. The number of fields requiring pressure pumping services is expected to grow, especially outside 
of North America, where BJ Services can leverage Baker Hughes' extensive international presence as it pursues 
growth opportunities, said the companies. 
In Canada, Baker Hughes reported revenue of $621.49 million (U.S.) compared to BJ revenue of $522.05 million 
in 2008. According to the Canadian Oil Register, Baker Hughes had 1,600 employees in Canada in 2008. 
Baker Hughes' Canadian product line includes horizontal and directional drilling systems, oil tools and specialty 
chemicals. 
Baker Hughes expects to realize annual cost savings of approximately $75 million in 2010 and $150 million in 
2011 as it eliminates redundant costs, consolidates facilities, and further rationalizes field costs. 
BJ, which has a Sept. 30 year-end, has been struggling in recent months with the current downturn in natural gas 
prices, posting a net loss of $32.34 million or 11 cents per share worldwide in its third quarter and has reduced 
staff as part of its cost-cutting measures. The deal comes after natural gas prices fell to a seven-year low.

Under the agreement, BJ Services stockholders will receive 0.40035 shares of Baker Hughes and cash of $2.69 
in exchange for each share of BJ Services common stock. Upon closing, and reflecting the issuance of new 
Baker Hughes shares, BJ Services stockholders collectively will own approximately 27.5% of Baker Hughes' 
outstanding shares. The Baker Hughes board of directors will be expanded to include two BJ Services board 
members. 
Baker, which will pay about 10 times BJ Services' 2010 earning before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortization, expects the deal to add to profits by 2011. 
The merger is subject to the approval of both Baker Hughes' and BJ Services' stockholders as well as other 
customary approvals. The transaction is anticipated to close as soon as the end of the calendar year. 
Baker Hughes and BJ Services intend to file a joint proxy statement prospectus with the United States Securities 
and Exchange Commission as soon as possible. 
Baker Hughes currently ranks as the fourth-largest oilfield services company by market value. 
"This has long been eyed by Baker to establish a more competitive position against the other two players," said 
Capital One Southcoast analyst Pierre Connor. "It's not a huge premium, but I think the market has been holding 
up BJ's price in anticipation of something like this." 
Baker Hughes and BJ Services' combined market capitalization will be about $16.3 billion, putting it ahead of 
National Oilwell Varco Inc. in the oil services field, but well behind Schlumberger, worth $68.8 billion, and 
Halliburton, at $21.8 billion.

DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) agreed to an acquisition of fellow oilfield-services provider BJ Services Co. (BJS) for 
$5.5 billion in cash and stock, marking the first big deal since commodity prices began tumbling in mid-2008. 
Both companies, like many in the oil patch, have been reporting slumping results of late amid the price plunge, 
which is crimping production and exploration as demand wanes for oil and natural gas. 
BJ holders will get $2.69 in cash and 0.40035 share of Baker Hughes for each share of BJ. That values the stock 
at a 16% premium to Friday's closing price of $15.43. BJ holders will own slightly more than one-quarter of the 
combined company. 
'The transaction further enhances Baker Hughes' position as a top-tier global oilfield services company,' said 
Chairman and Chief Executive Chad C. Deaton, noting the deal adds 'products, technologies and talented people 
that are key to helping our customers unlock value in their reservoirs, particularly in unconventional gas and 
deepwater fields. It will better position us to drive international growth and to compete for the growing large 
integrated projects by incorporating pressure pumping into our product offering.' 
Although pressure pumping accounted for less than 1% of Baker Hughes' 2008 revenue, the company said it 
would make up some 20% of the combined company's revenue. Baker Hughes noted that would put the total 
figure near its two largest competitors. Though unnamed in a statement, the two biggest oilfield-services 
companies are Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) and Halliburton Co. (HAL). 
Deaton said 'very little overlap' exists between the two companies. Still, Baker Hughes expects to some $75 
million in cost savings next year and double that in 2011 as it eliminates redundant costs and consolidates 
facilities. Baker Hughes' costs currently run about $9 billion a year. 
The deal should add to per-share earnings in 2011 and might be complete as soon as year's end. -By Kevin

DEALWATCH: BJ Services Will Spur Growth For Baker Hughes 
DEALWATCH: BJ Services Will Spur Growth For Baker Hughes 
By Kevin M. Nichols 
A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN 
634 words 
31 August 2009

Dow Jones News Service 
DJ 
English 
(c) 2009 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones) -- There are few obvious synergies for Baker Hughes Inc (BHI) in its $5.5 billion deal to 
buy BJ Services (BJS). But this complimentary business has enough to drive growth for the oil services 
company. 
It's the first major oil filed services acquisition since Smith International (SII) bought W-H Energy Services in June 
2008 for $3.1 billion. 
Baker Hughes is paying a 16.3% premium over Friday's closing share price where BJ services shareholders will 
receive 0.40035 shares of Baker Hughes and cash of $2.69. This will allow BJ Services shareholders to partially 
enjoy in the combination's future growth. After all, less than a year ago it's stock was trading nearly 75% higher 
than where it closed last week. 
Baker Hughes is paying 66.4x next-12-months earnings per share, 39.1x 2010 EPS and 17.6x 2011 EPS. That's 
rich given the oil field services sector trades at an average of 19.3X next-12-months EPS, according to FactSet 
data. 
Baker Hughes' intentions are clear. It wants to compete against the likes of Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger 
(SLB) in the pressure pumping segment of oil services. Halliburton Co., the biggest player, generates 29% of 
revenues from this segment. Baker Hughes only gets around one percent of revenues from its pressure pumping 
unit, but the deal should increase that to around 20% by next year and it would like to approach the 30%+ level in 
up to two years, according to CEO Chad Deaton. 
Growth will come from the development of deepwater offshore drilling projects and utilizing Baker Hughes' 
international platform to expand BJ Services pressure pumping business overseas. 
Synergies are very low for such a large sized deal, only $75 million are expected in 2010 and $150 million in 2011 
which will come strictly from overhead and field cost savings. 
The acquisition will certainly fill in gaps in Baker Hughes' current portfolio and even bring in technologies that 
could help optimize its current fracturing, cementing and acidizing services. 
However, despite the benefits, the price paid by Baker Hughes raises eyebrows. Pressure pumping prices have 
been hit by overcapacity in the last couple of years. Yet, Baker Hughes is ponying up $4,500 per unit of 
horsepower for BJ Services' hydraulic fleet size. Spears & Associates estimates current construction costs would 
only be at most $750 per unit of horsepower for a build out; but that would also require an additional major capital 
expenditure. 
Some believe it is cheaper to build new equipment than buy competitors, effectively, Baker Hughes is paying a 
premium to get achieve its pressure pumping ambitions today, rather than wait. 
A key driver behind value from this acquisition will be to what extent oil demand increases, leading to a higher 
number of oil rigs serviced by Baker Hughes. In its due diligence, Baker Hughes used a "conservative" increase 
in North American rig counts for 2010 and insists it does not need a "massive" recovery in energy prices for 
accretion to occur. 
Baker Hughes has slightly increased U.S. rig count last week to 999, but the number is still down by 1032 year 
over year. The company also modeled in $2 billion of goodwill and expects no real increase in asset prices.

The deal is expected to close by the end of the calendar year and should be accretive to earnings by 2011. Upon 
completion, the deal should produce 2010 eps of around $2.00 according to Dow Jones Investment Banker 
calculations. The break up fee is a low $175 million, an indication the deal should not face any regulatory 
headwinds. [ 08-31-09 1337ET ]

Disney's purchase of Marvel is one of two transactions that give a last-day bump to this month's M&A activity. 
Two large corporate purchases nudged the semiconscious mergers-and-acquisitions market on the last day of 
August. 
The $5.5 billion merger of oilfield-services company Baker Hughes with BJ Services, and Walt Disney's $4 billion 
acquisition of Marvel Entertainment, put M&A activity at $23.4 billion for August. Even with the two big deals, it 
was the lowest total since the $23.2 billion registered last November, according to Thomson Reuters. 
Expected to be completed by year-end, Disney's stock-and-cash purchase will put more than 5,000 comic-book 
characters under its roof. The likes of Iron Man, X-Men, Captain America, and the Incredible Hulk will now rub 
ears with another superhero of sorts, Mickey Mouse. 
During a conference call, Disney executives touted the acquisition as a strategic move, and in fact CEO Robert 
Iger said it was not a "must-do deal." But it gives access to the licensing opportunity that Marvel's character library 
brings through movies, toys, games, and so on. 
Disney CFO Thomas Staggs said the decision to buy Marvel "was not principally driven by cost savings," 
although there will be some redundancies when the deal is complete. He has concluded that the deal will 
positively affect Disney's earnings per share starting in 2012. 
Under the agreement, Disney will pay Marvel's shareholders $30 per share in cash and give them approximately 
0.745 Disney shares for each Marvel share they own. In other words, Disney plans to pay $50 per Marvel share. 
And the company plans to repurchase at least as many shares as it issues within the next 12 months, Staggs 
promised. 
Disney executives demurred when asked what the specific impact will be on Marvel's business partnerships. 
However, they have not ruled out completely taking control of films with Marvel characters when the existing 
partnerships run out. Paramount is scheduled to handle five more pictures for Marvel. "It would clearly be in our 
best interest and more attractive if over time we ended up as the sole distributor," said Iger. 
Marvel has used third parties to distribute some of its films, such as "Spider-Man 3" and "Fantastic Four 2," and 
has also independently produced movies, such as "Iron Man." 
While Disney is acquiring Marvel's well-known brands  including hundreds of relatively unknown characters  
executives said they do plan to keep the Marvel name and its creative team. 
As for the other large deal announced Monday, Baker Hughes will give BJ Services's shareholders 0.40035 
shares of its common stock and $2.69 in cash for each of their BJ Services shares. Baker Hughes expects to 
save approximately $75 million in 2010 and $150 million in 2011 by cutting redundant costs, consolidating 
facilities, and rationalizing field costs, and it expects the deal to be accretive to earnings per share in 2011. "The 
proposed merger will make Baker Hughes a stronger, more efficient service provider for our customers 
worldwide," says Baker Hughes chairman Chad Deaton.
