UnitedHealth Group Inc. posted a 15% rise in third-quarter profit and said an enrollment decline in its commercial 
business stemmed in part from its decision to put profitability ahead of revenue growth. 
"We strengthened our discipline in pricing to costs across the commercial-benefits market even at the cost of 
membership growth," Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley told investors on a conference call. He also said the 
company needs greater execution on fundamentals and customer focus to address the declines. 
Revenue grew 4% to $18.68 billion, short of the average forecast of $18.99 billion by analysts in a Thomson 
Financial survey. 
The Minnetonka, Minn., company, the first managed-care company to post third-quarter results, reported 
improvement in the percentage of premiums spent on medical costs, which dropped to 79.5% from 81.1% a year 
earlier. This may reassure investors who were rattled by an unexpectedly high medical-cost ratio in the 
commercial business in the first half. 
Total membership increased from a year earlier to almost 71 million members, though the company had slightly 
more than that in the second quarter. UnitedHealth expects membership in its commercial business to decline in 
January and then strengthen throughout 2008, Mr. Hemsley said. 
The employer-sponsored health-plan market is highly competitive, and the two largest managed-care companies, 
UnitedHealth and WellPoint Inc., both have seen attrition this year in group-plan enrollment. 
Nonetheless, UnitedHealth now expects full-year per-share earnings of $3.49 or $3.50, after previously 
forecasting $3.43 to $3.48. 
The company expects 2008 earnings per share of $3.95 to $4, including contributions from Sierra Health, which 
it plans to acquire by the end of 2007, and $7 billion in share repurchases through 2007 and 2008. 
In a report, J.P. Morgan analyst William Georges called the 2008 outlook disappointing, although the third-quarter 
earnings exceeded Wall Street views, and the medical-cost ratio was lower than he had predicted. 
UnitedHealth delivered important stabilization of the medical-cost ratio in the quarter, while its enrollment growth 
will likely lag behind peers next year, Deutsche Bank analyst Scott Fidel wrote to clients.

United goes West with its latest deal; UnitedHealth Group has moved into the Southwestern United States 
by acquiring Las Vegas-based insurer Sierra Health Services.

UnitedHealth Group Inc. solidified its position as a major provider of health care services in the West with the 
announcement Monday of the $2.6 billion acquisition of Sierra Health Services Inc. of Las Vegas. 
The all-cash deal for the 850,000-member health maintenance organization and insurer comes one week after 
UnitedHealth said that it had concluded an internal probe into stock-options backdating and that it would wipe 
away $1.5 billion in stated profit as a result. Analysts had predicted that the end of the internal probe would see 
UnitedHealth become active in the acquisitions business again. 
It was slightly more than a year ago that UnitedHealth acquired PacifiCare Health Systems for $8.1 billion, its first 
major move into the highly populated West Coast market. 
Now, by adding Sierra, UnitedHealth will have strong positions in Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Oregon, 
Washington and Texas, as well as California. 
The increased Western presence by UnitedHealth could take on added significance for the company as more 
older Americans retire to those warm-weather states. 
UnitedHealth is a leading provider of Medicare prescription drug insurance and has a close business relationship 
with the AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, which sells UnitedHealth insurance 
products with the AARP brand. Sierra also has a significant base of business among seniors. 
Nevada, according to estimates by the Census Bureau, is among the fastest-growing states, and its population 
has been steadily climbing for the past two decades. 
UnitedHealth Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said the merger provides "scale and resources" to increase the 
range of services that can be offered to clients in the Southwest. 
Wall Street agreed. 
"The deal makes sense to us and fills a hole in [UnitedHealth's] coverage area: If [UnitedHealth's] goal is to be a 
truly national plan, it needed [Sierra], just as it needed California and PacifiCare," wrote analyst Sheryl Skolnick of 
CRT Capital Group. 
However, Skolnick noted, Sierra stumbled on the pricing of its drug benefit plan, known as Part D, and it expects 
to lose money on that insurance product this year. UnitedHealth previously acknowledged it had its own Part D 
problems last year, including poor marketing and slow rollout of products. 
Sierra has 300,000 Medicare-enrolled members in Nevada; UnitedHealth had about 25,000 in that state. 
"The key risk to the deal ... is whether or not [Sierra] has truly fixed the Part D loss problem, because if they 
didn't, a bad plan design this spring ... could haunt" UnitedHealth next year, Skolnick wrote. 
David Heupel, portfolio manager for the Thrivent Large Cap Growth Fund, said the Sierra deal is another example 
of UnitedHealth's well-established growth-by-acquisition strategy. 
Before PacifiCare and its 1.5 million members, UnitedHealth acquired Oxford Health Plans with 1.5 million 
customers in 2004 as well as Mid Atlantic Medical Services with 2 million members. Oxford covers the

northeastern part of the United States, including the New York City metropolitan area, and Mid Atlantic covers the 
Eastern seaboard. 
"Sierra has a lot of exposure in Las Vegas, and that is one of the fastest-growing urban markets in the country," 
Heupel said. "It's one thing to grow organically when you're not the dominant player, but if you really want to get 
into a market, you have to do it this way. 
"We've seen them do it with PacifiCare, we've seen them do it with Oxford, and this fits that mold," he added. 
The deal requires regulatory approval in several states, including California, Nevada and Texas. UnitedHealth 
said it expects the transaction to close by the end of 2007. 
UnitedHealth shares rose 27 cents to close at $53.27 Monday. Sierra's shares jumped $5.47 to $41.57 on the 
strength of the offer. 
Sierra had 2006 revenue of $1.7 billion. UnitedHealth's revenue was $71.5 billion.

By Angela Moore 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones) -- UnitedHealth Group on Monday said it agreed to acquire Sierra Health Services Inc. 
for about $2.6 billion, giving the health insurer a larger footprint in the fast-growing Southwest region and boosting 
its senior health care capabilities. 
Under the terms of the deal, UnitedHealth (UNH) will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Sierra, a diversified 
health care services provider, for $43.50 per share in cash. The offer provides a 21% premium to Sierra's closing 
price of $35.90 on Friday. 
UnitedHealth also reiterated that it plans to buy back about $4 billion to $4.5 billion in stock in 2007 under its 
ongoing share repurchase program. 
Sierra shares were up 17% in premarket trading. 
The deal, which has been approved by the boards of both companies, is expected to close by the end of the 
calendar year or sooner. It is subject to state and federal regulatory approvals, including in Nevada, California and 
Texas, approval by Sierra's stockholders, and other customary conditions, UnitedHealth said. 
"We have completed extensive due diligence, and expect Sierra's positive performance to continue," said Mike 
Mikan, chief financial officer of UnitedHealth, in a statement. "Sierra is a financially strong organization with very 
stable operations and systems, and has a long and well-recognized history of consistently and profitably 
delivering high-quality, affordable health care in Nevada." 
Sierra (SIE) provides health benefits and services, and serves about 310,000 employer-sponsored health plan 
members in Nevada and 320,000 people in senior and government programs throughout the U.S. 
Under the agreement, a wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealthcare, a UnitedHealth Group company, will 
merge with Sierra. The agreement requires Sierra to pay UnitedHealth a breakup fee of about $85 million in the 
event the deal is not consummated for certain specified reasons, such as Sierra's board changing its 
recommendation of the merger. 
UnitedHealth expects the acquisition will immediately add to earnings per share upon closing, adding earnings of 
about 4 cents a share in the first 12 months excluding any potential synergies. UnitedHealth will not include these 
earnings gains in its financial outlook until the transaction has closed. 
UnitedHealth said its financial synergies are expected to add up to $30 million in additional operating earnings to 
combined company results in calendar 2008, with additional gains to follow in subsequent years. 
The deal will be financed by UnitedHealth with cash on hand, cash flows from operations and normal capital 
market activities. 
The combined business in the Nevada region will continue under the leadership of Anthony Marlon, Sierra's 
chairman and chief executive, and his management team. 
"The combined enterprise will have the scale, resources and commitment to offer the most comprehensive range 
of affordable services to our clients in the Southwest, as well as for clients with business interests across the 
country," UnitedHealth's CEO Stephen Hemsley said in a statement.

The addition of Sierra complements UnitedHealth's businesses in the high-growth Southwest region, the company 
said. UnitedHealth said it already has solid market positions in the adjacent growth states of Arizona, California, 
Colorado and Utah. 
"The assets, brands and reputations of Sierra and Southwest Medical Associates will significantly strengthen our 
growth platform in the region. Sierra is widely recognized as the best-in-class local health benefits provider in 
Nevada," said David Wichmann, president of UnitedHealth's individual and employer markets business group. 
Sierra Health Services and UnitedHealth were served on this agreement by financial advisors Lehman Brothers 
and J.P. Morgan, respectively. [ 03-12-07 0912ET ]
