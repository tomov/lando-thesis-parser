Nucor Corp. has entered a deal to acquire LMP Steel & Wire Co. for $28 million. 
The acquisition will improve Nucor's position in the cold-finished steel market, the Charlotte, N.C.,-based mini-mill 
said Thursday. The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter, Nucor said. 
LMP, based in Maryville, Mo., makes cold-finished bars. With about 100,000 tons of capacity and 150 employees, 
the company primarily services the North American construction and original equipment manufacturer markets. 
"The acquisition of LMP is a solid growth opportunity for one of our core downstream businesses," Daniel 
DiMicco, Nucor's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. "LMP's highly 
complementary product offering and operations will be a good fit with our existing cold finish business." 
Nucor has made several acquisitions in the North American market this year to improve its downstream presence. 
In June, the company announced a $280-million bid for Magnatrax Corp., Alpharetta, Ga. (AMM, June 26). Nucor 
also had earlier acquired Harris Steel Group Inc., Toronto, for Canadian $1.25 billion ($1.19 billion) (AMM, Jan. 
3). 
Magnatrax makes metal building systems for the North American non-residential construction market and also 
operates fabrication plants and transportation facilities across the United States. 
Harris operates several business units, including Laurel Steel, a manufacturer and distributor of wire and wire 
products, welded wire mesh and cold-finished bar.
