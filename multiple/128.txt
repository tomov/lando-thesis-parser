Lehman Brothers took a large step to grow its private equity business with the acquisition of The Crossroads 
Group.Lehman is to buy the Dallas-based fund, which has made some investments in Europe, as party of plans 
to broaden its range of products. 
The bank refused to say how much it paid for the Crossroads Group. Crossroads has invested about $2bn in 200 
companies over the past 22 years. It has a fund of funds business and is indirectly invested in more than 5,000 
companies around the world. 
Lehman said in a statement: 'The new products Lehman Brothers and The Crossroads Group plan to offer include 
innovative private equity investment alternatives, such as securitized fund-of-funds, secondary investment funds 
and principal protected investment funds. 
It is Lehman's second notable acquisition in two months having bought fund management firm Neuberger in July. 
Dick Fuld, chairman and chief executive of Lehman wants to diversify the firm and reduce Lehman's dependence 
on fixed income. 
The deal comes at a time of increased buying and selling of private equity assets. Changes in capital adequacy 
rules in Basel II are making it more expensive to own private equity assets. These changes are prompting some 
firms to reduce their exposure to private equity. 
In July Deutsche Bank sold part of its private equity holdings to Credit Suisse First Boston. Buyers say that they 
are confident that the opportunity to profit from the asset class outweighs any extra capital cost. 
The Crossroads Group will become a part of Lehman Brothers' Private Equity Division, headed by Michael 
Odrich. Brad Heppner, chairman and chief executive of the Crossroads Group will join Anthony Tutrone as 
co-head of the private funds investment group, one of the five asset classes of Lehman Brothers' private equity 
business. 
Crossroads Group will keep its Dallas head office and Lehman said that all 55 employees 'are expected to remain 
with the business'.

Comment - Pros And Cons Of Lehman Deal - Will Lehman Get Value For Money From Its Acquisition Of 
Neuberger Berman? 
Investment banks have long aimed to smooth out the volatility of their business model by deriving some of their 
revenues from the steadier income streams of private client business. The potential of cross-selling and repacking 
products for clients with whom the firm has an existing and, they hope, close relationship is also compelling. 
Throughout the bull market this strategy was taken to new heights as investment banks sought to capitalise on 
the retail appetite for equities. But profits plummeted and many have muttered that the high prices paid for money 
managers at the peak of the market seemed a few million dollars too far when the equity wave broke over their 
heads. 
Now the bear seems a bit more bullish and investment banks are buying again. But will they get more value for 
money? Last month, Lehman Brothers entered a definitive agreement to acquire Neuberger Berman for 
$2.635bn, with about $63.7bn under management. Compare that to Chase Manhattan's acquisition of UK asset 
manager Robert Fleming, with $100m assets under management, for $7.75bn in April 2000. 
Lehman seems to have timed the transaction well: its share price is high and the price tag more manageable. The 
deal also continues CEO Dick Fuld's drive to build a broader business by extending Lehman's reach in private 
client services but the combined portfolio of assets of more than $100bn will still be dwarfed by that of players like 
Goldman Sachs, which boasts about $364bn. 
Pundits have asked whether earlier deals added real value to the acquirer or removed volatility from their revenue 
streams. Acquisitions such as DLJ by Credit Suisse or Paine Webber by UBS failed to garner the profitability in 
their private client business that purchasers expected. Paine Webber's broker-type structure seemed like a smart 
move in the stock market boom but in the subsequent fallout it looked less and less attractive. 
It is sometimes noted that the US can be a graveyard for European acquisitions. This may resonate with many 
European firms, but offers little explanation for dismal results. Is success or failure dictated as much by acquiring 
the right business model as by increasing assets under management? If decreased earnings volatility is a goal, it 
is senseless to buy a firm whose revenues are transaction-based and whose income streams will be subject to 
the same cyclical pressures as the parent. In this sense too, Neuberger Berman - with its fee-based business 
model - looks like a good play for Lehman. 
Much also rests on client approval. A lot of Fleming's clients jumped ship when it joined the Chase flotilla, and any 
lucrative private client business loses its lustre when the private clients take their assets elsewhere. It remains to 
be seen whether Neuberger Berman's clients will find dealing with Lehman a palatable option.

The Asian Banker 
ASABNK

Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (NYSE:LEH) and Neuberger Berman Inc. (NYSE:NEU) announced today that 
they have entered into a definitive agreement whereby Lehman Brothers will acquire Neuberger Berman in a 
transaction valued, at the time of the announcement, at approximately $2.625 billion (including $42 million in 
in-the-money options and less $255 million in net excess cash as of June 30, 2003 and excluding 1.6 million 
unvested restricted shares in employee compensation plans). Under the terms of the agreement, based on 
yesterday's closing stock price, each Neuberger Berman shareholder would receive an implied price of $41.48 
per share consisting of $9.49 in cash and 0.496 shares of Lehman Brothers common stock. The number of 
shares to be received by each Neuberger Berman shareholder may, however, be adjusted if the price of Lehman 
Brothers common stock is above $66.51 during a period shortly prior to closing, subject to a collar. 
Transaction Benefits* The acquisition of Neuberger Berman's Private Asset Management business will position 
Lehman Brothers as one of the industry's leading providers of services to high-net-worth investors * The addition 
will bring Lehman Brothers' client assets under management to over $100 billion* Neuberger Berman will expand 
Lehman Brothers' capabilities in the areas of mutual funds, wrap accounts, institutional separate accounts, and 
alternative investments* Lehman Brothers will provide Neuberger Berman's clients with access to an expanded 
range of investment products and services to manage risk or seek enhanced returns, including structured capital 
markets products, private equity, and other alternative and asset management products* Neuberger Berman's 
comprehensive portfolio of money management products will create incremental product opportunities to be 
distributed through Lehman Brothers' global network of institutional and high-net-worth clients* The combination is 
expected to further enhance Lehman Brothers' revenue diversification and earnings stability, raising the 
percentage of revenues from its Client Services Segment from 13% to 21%, on a pro forma basis for 2002 
Lehman Brothers Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard S. Fuld, Jr. said, "Neuberger Berman is an ideal 
partner for Lehman Brothers in every respect. Strategically, this acquisition meets our objectives of enhancing 
business diversification and growing our higher margin businesses. Financially, we expect the combination to 
further improve our ability to generate consistent and attractive cross-cycle results and create additional value for 
our shareholders. Culturally, Neuberger Berman is a wonderful fit with our One Firm culture. Its team-oriented 
culture, as well as the minimal overlap in our business platforms, should help ensure a smooth integration 
process. We look forward to welcoming everyone at Neuberger Berman as colleagues." 
Jeffrey B. Lane, president and chief executive officer of Neuberger Berman, added, "In Lehman Brothers, we 
have found the best possible partner. Neuberger Berman's strategy has been to diversify the breadth of the 
products and services we offer in order to meet client needs and be responsive to the ever-changing global 
securities markets. This strategy has helped us achieve solid performance across the business cycle for both our 
clients and shareholders. By combining our industry-leading private wealth and asset management platform with 
Lehman Brothers' wide range of products and geographic scope, we can create an even greater array of 
opportunities together." 
Subsequent to the closing of the transaction, Neuberger Berman will become part of Lehman Brothers' Client 
Services Segment's Wealth and Asset Management Division headed by Theodore P. Janulis. Jeffrey B. Lane will 
become a vice chairman of Lehman Brothers, a member of the Office of the Chairman, chairman of the Wealth 
and Asset Management Division, and chairman of Neuberger Berman. Robert Matza will become president of 
Neuberger Berman and remain its chief operating officer. In addition, Mr. Matza will join Lehman Brothers' 
Management Committee. 
Pursuant to the definitive agreement, each share of Neuberger Berman will be exchanged for $9.49 in cash and 
a fractional share of Lehman Brothers common stock based on the average trading price of Lehman Brothers 
common stock during a period of time shortly prior to closing. The exchange ratio would be fixed at 0.496 if the 
average stock price during that period were $66.51 or less. If the average stock price were greater than $66.51

Page 8 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
but not more than $73.00, the exchange ratio would vary so that Neuberger Berman shareholders would receive 
total per share consideration of $42.50. Above $73.00, the exchange ratio mechanics vary subject to a minimum 
exchange ratio of 0.411 if the average stock price were above $90.41. 
The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is subject to the approval of 
Neuberger Berman shareholders and other closing conditions, regulatory approvals, and termination events. As 
part of the overall transaction, the 32 active Neuberger Berman partners who lead most of the wealth 
management teams will convert their Neuberger Berman stock, including approximately $941 million in shares 
subject to transfer restrictions, into Lehman Brothers stock and cash on the same basis as the public 
shareholders. All Lehman Brothers stock received in exchange for these restricted shares will continue to be 
subject to similar transfer restrictions. Also, Lehman Brothers will establish a $120 million stock retention pool for 
key producers, subject to vesting. The transaction is expected to close during Lehman Brothers' 2003 fiscal fourth 
quarter. 
The transaction is intended to be tax-free with respect to the Lehman Brothers common stock to be received in 
the transaction by Neuberger Berman shareholders. Lehman Brothers was advised in the transaction by its own 
M&A advisory group, and Neuberger Berman was advised by Merrill Lynch.

Neuberger buy gives Lehman high-end leverage. 
Neuberger buy gives Lehman high-end leverage.

EW York brokerage firm Lehman Brothers has ac-quired a high-end equity management company, Neuberger 
Berman, in a bid to overcome missed opportunities in the late-1990s boom, recapture its glory days on Wall 
Street and take on bigger rivals.With most of its business in fixed income, the firm remained in the shadows of the 
bigger brokerages during the bull market in stocks at the end of the last decade. Since it was spun off from 
American Express in 1994, Lehman had sought to acquire an equities management firm to diversify its mainly 
debt underwriting and trading operations. 
Lehman's revenue last year from fixed-income business - $2.6bn (£1.6bn, E2.3bn) - was almost three times that 
from equities underwriting and trading ($1bn). In the second quarter, 65% of business came from bond trading or 
underwriting. 
As Wall Street brokerages go, Lehman is viewed as a second division firm behind the likes of Morgan Stanley 
and Merrill Lynch, both of whom bought huge money management companies during the boom.E 
"Since being spun off from American Express, Lehman Brothers has never generated the razzle-dazzle profits 
that characterise investment banks in boom years," said a recent research report by Multex Investor. "During the 
1990s, many large rivals posted returns on equity of 40% or more, a rate that Lehman couldn't even approach." 
But the sharp sell-off in the stock market after the dot.com bubble burst has changed all that. The flight from 
stocks and historically low interest rates caused bond markets to soar. Lehman's share price took off, gaining 
19% this year, outperforming the bigger securities firms and making the current merger possible. 
Last week Lehman announced that it had bought Neuberger, a firm serving mostly wealthy individuals, for $2.6bn 
in cash and stock. Neuberger Berman's $63.7bn under management gives Lehman a vehicle to compete in one 
of Wall Street's most elite businesses: providing financial services for high-end investors. It also raises to $100bn 
the amount of assets it will manage for clients when the deal is completed by the end of the year. 
Richard Fuld, Lehman's chief executive, was enthusiastic in a conference call with reporters. "When Neuberger 
is combined with our existing wealth and asset management group, Lehman Brothers will emerge as one of the 
leading providers of services to a highly desirable marketplace." 
Some analysts took a rather more moderate view of the acquisition. They are not holding their breath waiting for 
Lehman to catapult into the same league as Merrill or Goldman Sachs. 
Analysts say the deal is risky because its success amounts to a bet on a sustained recovery of the US stock 
market, not at all a sure thing. Kenneth Worthington, an analyst at CIBC World Markets who follows both Lehman 
and Neuberger, thinks Lehman won't need a late-1990s style boom to make it work, however. "That's why they 
got a good deal and the price was fair," he said. 
"The purchase price represents 4.1% of assets under management, which while not cheap is generally in line with 
historical industry norms," added Jeffery Harte, associate director of Sandler O'Neill in a note to investors. Harte 
upgraded Lehman to "buy" from "hold" on the news. 
The integration of the two firms should go smoothly enough, analysts say. Lehman is set to pay up to $120m in 
bonuses to senior Neuberger employees as an incentive to stay on. Lehman also wants to commit 30 top fund 
managers from Neuberger to three-year contracts. 
There shouldn't be friction between the two CEOs as Neuberger chief executive Jeffery Lane worked with Fuld at 
Lehman from 1969 to the 1989. He will become vice-chairman of Lehman.

Page 10 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"While Lehman will own every last share of Neuberger, it is going to be run as an autonomous business," Lane 
told reporters. 
Whether it succeeds in challenging Wall Street powerhouses, Lehman has come a long way from when German 
immigrant Henry Lehman opened a general store in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1844. His brothers, Emanuel and 
Mayer, joined him six years later to create Lehman Brothers. After the American civil war, the brothers moved to 
New York, helped to establish the Cotton Exchange and later undertook their first sales and trading of bonds 
during the railroad boom. 
They became members of the New York Stock Exchange in 1887. By the 1920s Lehman was arranging financing 
for Hollywood start-up ventures RKO, Paramount and 20th Century Fox. In the 1930s it underwrote the flotation 
for Dumont, the first television manufacturer. 
Oil was next on the agenda in the 1920s and in the 1950s Lehman underwrote the IPO for one of the earliest 
computer firms, Digital Equipment, now owned by Compaq, in a deal Lehman Brothers arranged. 
Lehman expanded to Paris in 1960 and London in 1972. After a series of mergers with Kuhn, Loeb & Co, and 
with Shearson and Rhoades, the firm became known as Shearson Lehman/American Express in 1984. When 
Amex sold it off 10 years later, it reverted to the name of the Alabama general store. 
Roy Neuberger, a Manhattan art collector who turned 100 a week ago, founded Neuberger in 1939. In 1950, it 
became one of the first firms to offer no-load mutual funds. Neuberger went public in 1999. 
But analysts caution that the combination of these venerable firms will still leave Lehman far from the top on Wall 
Street. While it will manage $100bn, Merrill recently had $471bn of assets under management and Morgan 
Stanley had $421bn.

NEW YORK -- Moving to ease its dependence on bond trading and underwriting, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
said yesterday that it agreed to acquire investment adviser Neuberger Berman Inc. for $2.63 billion in cash and 
stock. 
Despite Lehman's efforts to increase its presence in the equities arena, the sharp stock-market declines of the 
last few years have left Lehman largely dependent on its bonds business. The New York-based companies were 
reported to be in talks late last month. 
Under the agreement announced yesterday, each Neuberger Berman shareholder would receive about $41.48 
for each Neuberger share - $9.49 in cash and 0.496 share of Lehman. 
The deal represents a 2.6 percent premium to Neuberger's Monday closing share price of $40.44 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
Lehman shares fell 80 cents to $63.70 on the NYSE yesterday. Neuberger shares, up 20 percent since the 
companies' talks were disclosed in late June, slid 29 cents to $40.15. 
Financial-services giant Lehman said the acquisition of Neuberger's private-asset-management business would 
leave it as one of the industry's leading providers of services to wealthy investors. 
"Neuberger Berman is an ideal partner for Lehman Brothers in every respect," Lehman Brothers chairman and 
chief executive officer Richard S. Fuld Jr. said in a statement. "Strategically, this acquisition meets our objectives 
of enhancing business diversification and growing our higher-margin businesses." 
Jeffrey B. Lane, Neuberger's president and CEO, would become a Lehman vice chairman and lead the wealth 
and management business. Robert Matza would become president of Neuberger Berman and remain its chief 
operating officer. 
Both firms' boards have approved the deal, which is expected to close in Lehman's fiscal fourth quarter, subject to 
approval by Neuberger shareholders. Lehman's fiscal year ends in November. 
Neuberger, whose primary business is managing money for well-heeled investors through its 
private-asset-management group, had $63.7 billion in assets under management as of June 30.

Lehman Brothers has confirmed its anticipated purchase of fund manager Neuberger Berman, a deal aimed at 
enabling the investment bank to compete head on with the big Wall Street players such as Merrill Lynch.The 
$2.6bn (€2.2bn) cash and shares deal more than doubles Lehman's assets under management to $100bn and 
gives it a roster of some of the wealthiest investors in the US. 
Chairman and chief executive Richard Fuld has been trying for several years to expand Lehman beyond the fixed 
income business for which it is best known. He has poached investment bankers and expanded the equity trading 
arm, but this is the first major fund management deal. At $41.48 a share, of which $9.49 is cash and the rest 
Lehman stock, the deal is at a small premium to Neuberger's share price.

FOR YEARS, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. has been potential takeover prey for Wall Street rivals. Now, 
Lehman Chief Executive Richard Fuld Jr. is playing the role of hunter, using cash from Lehman's bond operations 
to help the firm diversify its operations. 
The firm announced it is buying money manager Neuberger Berman Inc. in a deal valued at $2.63 billion (2.32 
billion euros) in cash and stock, less than the $3 billion initially discussed, a figure some shareholders said was 
too steep. 
Lehman, long keen to reduce its reliance on bond trading and underwriting, aggressively expanded its stock 
businesses in the late 1990s, in areas such as mergers-and-advisory work and stock research. Despite its efforts, 
the bear market has left Lehman largely dependent on bonds, which turned out to be a blessing given how well 
the area did in the face of a turbulent stock market. In the second quarter, for instance, about 65% of Lehman's 
revenue came from bond trading or underwriting. With the acquisition of Neuberger, Mr. Fuld said the firm will 
now be a serious player in managing investor assets. 
The transaction comes as big brokerage houses such as Merrill Lynch & Co. have been wooing wealthy investors 
that are Neuberger's core clients. With the Neuberger purchase, Lehman will manage more than $100 billion in 
assets, though that still pales compared with some rivals. Merrill recently had $471 billion of assets under 
management and Morgan Stanley had $421 billion. 
"Sure we have a hill to climb," Mr. Fuld said of the highly competitive world of asset management. "But I have 
long been a believer that business begets business and this is a great start." 
Said Neuberger CEO Jeffrey Lane: "While Lehman will own every last share of Neuberger, it is going to be run 
as an autonomous business." 
For years, Lehman wasn't in a position to make big purchases. Rivals from Deutsche Bank to BankAmerica Corp. 
to Chase Manhattan Corp. all were interested in buying Lehman, particularly after the 1998 global market crisis 
hurt its stock price. Now, said Lehman Chief Financial Officer David Goldfarb, the firm is in position to buy a 
money-management firm catering to wealthy investors, saying: "Our strong relative performance over the past 
few years has created a currency to allow us to make this acquisition." 
Lehman shares were trading at nearly $68 each on the New York Stock Exchange when news leaked several 
weeks ago that the firm was in talks with Neuberger. Tuesday, Lehman shares traded down 85 cents, or 1.3%, to 
$63.65 each in late-afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. Neuberger shares initially surged on news of a 
possible deal but were down 43 cents, or 1.1%, to $40.01 each on the Big Board. 
Neuberger shareholders are getting $41.48 a share, a 2.6% premium to the company's price on Monday. 
However, the price marks a 21% premium to the asset manager's trading price before news of the merger talks 
broke last month. 
Neuberger shareholders will receive $9.49 in cash and 0.496 share of Lehman stock in the deal. The transaction, 
Lehman said, includes a collar that will adjust the number of Lehman shares distributed if the investment bank's 
stock is above $66.51 during a period shortly before closing.

For Jeffrey B. Lane, becoming a vice chairman at Lehman has a familiar ring. 
The 61-year-old chief executive of Neuberger Berman Inc. is slated to become a vice chairman of Lehman 
Brothers Holdings Inc. after Lehman completes its $2.6 billion acquisition of Neuberger. 
Mr. Lane's career illustrates how small the Wall Street world can be, particularly if you work for Sanford Weill, a 
serial acquirer of financial-services companies who now heads Citigroup Inc. 
Mr. Lane began his career at CBWL-Hayden Stone, the company Mr. Weill helped found and head, and ended up 
working on and off for Mr. Weill until 1998. By the mid-1980s, Mr. Lane was vice chairman and chief operating 
officer at Shearson Lehman Brothers, then a unit of American Express Co., whose president was Mr. Weill. In 
1985, Mr. Weill left American Express, but Mr. Lane stayed. 
Mr. Lane became president of Shearson Lehman in 1987, a post he held until he resigned in January 1990 after 
being demoted by then-Chairman and Chief Executive Peter Cohen. 
Less than two months later, Lane was snapped up by his old boss Mr. Weill, who had become head of Primerica 
Corp. Mr. Weill hired Mr. Lane to be president of the Primerica Holdings subsidiary. 
Mr. Lane continued to rise after subsequent Weill acquisitions, becoming a vice chairman at Smith Barney in 
charge of asset management, then vice chairman and group executive at Travelers. 
Mr. Lane left Travelers in July 1998 to become chief administrative officer at what was then called Neuberger 
&Berman. In October 1999, when Neuberger &Berman held its initial public offering, he became its president and 
chief executive. 
Despite his history at the firm, Mr. Lane says he has no intentions on vying for the CEO's job when Richard Fuld 
Jr. eventually steps down. "I'm 61 -- been there done that. I told Dick Fuld, `I don't want your job but if you want 
mine, we can talk,'" he joked.

Lehman Brothers, one of the great beneficiaries of the global bond boom, moved yesterday to diversify its 
business, unveiling a $2.6bn agreement to buy Neuberger Berman, a fund manager that focuses on wealthy 
investors. 
The deal has been expected since the two companies confirmed late last month they were in talks, but it comes 
at a dramatic moment for Wall Street. 
Rising longer-term interest rates in the US are raising concerns about the sustainability of earnings at investment 
banks such as Lehman, which has been making most of its revenues in the fixed-income markets. 
Richard Fuld, Lehman chairman and chief executive, denied that the Neuberger deal was motivated by 
Lehman's current view of the bond market. 
Rather, he portrayed the deal as part of a longer-term project to reduce Lehman's reliance on trading revenue and 
make more money from fees. The deal is expected to dilute earnings next year, underscoring its strategic 
dimension. 
"This combination would reduce our overall revenue volatility, improve the quality of our earnings and enhance 
our cross-cycle performance," Mr Fuld said. 
The deal, which is expected to close by November, subject to regulatory approvals, will give Lehman more than 
$100bn in assets under management. Its revenues from advising investors would rise from 13 to 21 per cent of 
the group total. 
Neuberger shareholders will receive an implied price of $41.48 a share, consisting of $9.49 in cash and 0.496 
shares of Lehman. The number of shares could be adjusted if Lehman shares are trading above $66.51 shortly 
before the closing. 
Worth $76.25 as recently as June, Lehman shares have fallen in recent weeks, reflecting anxieties about the deal 
and the weakness in the bond markets. Its stock was down 1.27 per cent to $63.68 in midday trading. 
The leaders of the two companies, Mr Fuld and Jeffrey Lane, Neuberger's chief executive, worked together at 
the old Shearson Lehman investment bank and they predicted their current corporate cultures would prove 
compatible. 
"Our starting point has always been culture," Mr Fuld said. "The fit with Neuberger is extremely strong." To 
further the integration of the two companies, Lehman set up a $120m stock retention fund for key producers. 
Neuberger will retain its name and operate as part of Lehman's wealth and asset management division headed 
by Theodore Janulis. 
Mr Lane will be a vice-chairman of Lehman, a member of its office of the chairman, chairman of the wealth and 
asset management division and chairman of Neuberger. Robert Matza will be Neuberger's president and chief 
operating officer.

Lehman Brothers has finally pulled off the acquisition of Neuberger Berman. Dick Fuld, Lehman's chairman and 
chief executive, insists that his eagerness to buy an asset manager is nothing to do with timing the market. It is 
hard, however, to escape the conclusion that Lehman has taken advantage of a peak in its predominantly fixed 
income earnings to buy itself some diversification into equities. 
The headline price of $2.625bn is lower than the $3bn at first mooted. But throw in a $120m employee retention 
plan - you always have to buy an asset manager twice over - and another $66m of restricted employee stock, and 
the price starts to climb above 26 times 2003 earnings. But only a small portion of this is to be paid in cash. 
Three-quarters of the consideration comes in the form of Lehman stock - which has fallen by 8 per cent, against a 
broadly flat market, since the deal first began to be discussed publicly a month ago. 
It is this stock element that is key to Lehman's motivation for the deal. After a blow-out second quarter, Lehman 
has been trading at its highest valuations, relative to its investment banking peers and to the overall market, since 
it floated in 1994. The temptation to take advantage of this highly valued stock, and at a time when asset 
managers' valuations are more depressed, seems to have proved too great. Technology companies, media 
groups and mobile phone operators can, however, testify that overpaying in overvalued stock still means 
overpaying.

LEHMAN Brothers yesterday confirmed its anticipated purchase of fund manager Neuberger Berman, a deal 
aimed at enabling the investment bank to compete head on with the big Wall Street players such as Merrill Lynch. 
The $2.6 billion ( £1.6 billion) cash and shares deal more than doubles Lehman's assets under management to 
$100 billion and gives it a roster of some of the wealthiest investors in America. 
Chairman and chief executive Richard Fuld has been trying for several years to expand Lehman beyond the fixed 
income business for which it is best known. 
He has poached investment bankers and expanded the equity trading arm, but this is the first major fund 
management deal. 
At $41.48 a share, of which $9.49 is cash and the rest Lehman stock, the deal is at a small premium to 
Neuberger's share price. 
In addition to its wealthy client list, Neuberger has some leading fund managers, although it has struggled to 
grow in the past three years due to the bearish stock market. 
Lehman said yesterday that job losses from the deal would be "minimal". The bank first revealed it was in talks in 
early July following repeated speculation. 
Theoretically, a rival could still launch a counter offer for Neuberger, but the fund manager would have to pay a 
$95m break-up fee to terminate the Lehman deal. 
Mr Fuld said the takeover "meets our objectives of enhancing business diversification and growing out higher 
margin business". 
Lehman shares were up 32 cents at $64.87 by early afternoon in New York yesterday, while Neuberger drifted 
down 14 cents at $40.30.

Lehman Will Acquire Neuberger --- Company to Widen Reach In Asset Management Through $2.6 Billion Deal

Lehman Will Acquire Neuberger --- Company to Widen Reach In Asset Management Through $2.6 Billion 
Deal

NEW YORK -- Dipping a toe into the lucrative waters of asset management, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
announced a $2.6 billion deal for Neuberger Berman Inc. 
Lehman, which is a small participant in the asset-management arena, has said for some time that it would like to 
increase that business, possibly through acquisition if the price and fit were right. The firm, which has done much 
of its growth internally, has been picky about acquisitions. 
The companies were in talks late last month, with speculation that Lehman wanted to expand its reach in the 
investment-management business as it bet that individual investors were headed back into the market in large 
numbers. 
Part of the allure of Neuberger is the assets it manages for wealthy individuals, which is a main focus for 
Lehman. Other asset managers that focus on this lucrative area are also on the watch list as acquisition targets. 
The Neuberger acquisition would propel Lehman beyond its traditional trading and underwriting of bonds, setting 
it up to compete more aggressively with Wall Street rivals such as Merrill Lynch & Co. and Morgan Stanley. 
Lehman has been criticized for relying too much on the bond market for revenue. While this strategy paid off as 
bond markets surged during a three-year stock-market swoon, Lehman has been anxious to diversify its revenue 
stream. 
The Neuberger deal fits with Lehman's strategy of improving diversification and "furthers our objective of deriving 
a higher portion of our revenue from fee-based activities," said Richard Fuld Jr., chairman and chief executive of 
Lehman, on a conference call with analysts. 
With the addition of Neuberger's $63.7 billion, Lehman will have more than $100 billion of assets under 
management. Still, it pales in comparison with other Wall Street giants. Merrill Lynch & Co., for example, had 
$471 billion of assets under management at the end of its second quarter in June. Morgan Stanley had $421 
billion and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. had $346 billion at the end of their fiscal second quarters in May. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Lehman will pay about $41.48 a share, consisting of $9.49 in cash and 0.496 
shares of Lehman common stock. The price is a 2.6% premium over Neuberger's closing price Monday of 
$40.44, and up 17% from where they were before talk of a deal. 
In a conference call held by the two companies, Lehman executives said job losses resulting from the deal will be 
"minimal" and that the deal likely will reduce its earnings per share only slightly in 2004. 
Both boards have approved the transaction. Regulators must still also approve the agreement. 
Lehman said the number of shares received by Neuberger shareholders may be adjusted within limits if Lehman 
stock is above $66.51 during a period shortly prior to closing. Lehman stock settled at $64.50 Monday. 
The deal's $2.6 billion price tag includes $42 million in options, less $255 million in net excess cash at June 30. It 
excludes 1.6 million unvested restricted shares in employee compensation plans. 
Lehman isn't the first suitor for Neuberger Berman, whose stock went public in 1999. A person familiar with the 
situation said last month that several financial institutions had expressed interest in the firm, though it wasn't clear 
if any of them might swoop in to prevent a Lehman deal.

advice from Merrill Lynch & Co.

NEW YORK (AFX) - Lehman Brothers said Tuesday it's buying asset manager Neuberger Berman for $2.6 
billion, a move that will make Lehman the industry's leading servicer of high net worth individuals. In a widely 
anticipated move, Lehman is paying a total $41.48 per share, $9.49 in cash and 0.496 in Lehman common stock, 
for Neuberger. The deal is offering a mere 2.6 percent premium to Neuberger's closing share price of $40.44 
Monday. But Neuberger's shares, off 53 cents to $39.91 in afternoon trading Tuesday, have gained nearly 14 
percent since talks were disclosed in June. "Strategically, this acquisition meets our objectives of enhancing 
business diversification and growing our higher margin business," said Lehman Chairman and CEO Richard Fuld. 
The boards of both companies have approved the transaction, which still needs the recommendation of 
Neuberger shareholders. 
The deal, which is subject to closing conditions, regulatory approvals and termination events, is expected to close 
in the fourth quarter. The acquisition will make Lehman the industry's leading provider of services to high net 
worth individuals. With Neuberger, Lehman is also expected to cut its reliance on bond trading and underwriting, 
which has driven the company's profit for the last several quarter. Interest rates have been at historic lows for 
several quarters, and Wall Street pros know that can't last forever. Lehman was widely viewed as needing to 
further diversify its income mix or suffer the consequences when the bond market eventually turned. Founded in 
1939, Neuberger has $63.7 billion in assets under management. The New York-based firm is known for 
managing the assets of high-net-worth individuals with accounts starting at $500,000. Lehman's stock shed $1 to 
$63.50. Similar cultures The deal brings together management teams that are very familiar with each other. Some 
years ago, American Express owned both Lehman Brothers and Shearson Hammill, when AmEx was building its 
brokerage operations. Jeff Lane, Neuberger's current CEO, was president and chief operating officer at 
Shearson from 1982 to 1989. Robert Matza, Neuberger's COO, was chief financial officer under Lane. Richard 
Fuld, now Lehman's CEO, ascended to prominence in 1989 when he became president of Shearson Lehman. He 
also succeeded Lane in the position. Serious talks between the firms began in June, though the two had 
discussed merging before. Lane and Matza's familiarity with Fuld helped speed negotiations, a person familiar 
with the discussion told CBS Marketwatch.com. Lane, on a conference call open to analysts Tuesday, said price 
was one of the considerations of the takeover. "The strategic and cultural fits between the company are so 
compelling," he said. "I am willing to own Lehman paper. Over time, Lehman and Neuberger will be much 
stronger together than separate." With the takeover, Neuberger will become part of Lehman's wealth and asset 
management unit. Lane will become chairman of Neuberger Berman and vice chairman of Lehman. He will also 
become a member of the chairman's office and chairman of wealth and asset management. Matza will become 
remain COO of Neuberger and assume the president position. On the cheap At $2.6 billion, the purchase price is 
lower than the $3 billion that was widely expected. "It's a somewhat low price," said analyst William Katz, of 
Putnam Lovell NBF Securities, said. "They have a superior footprint in the space versus what has been sold. By 
the same token, the company did indicate that price is sometimes a third consideration, with strategic and cultural 
fits being important as well." The $2.6 billion purchase is a little lower the $3 billion price tag made public in June, 
said analyst Reilly Tierney of Fox-Pitt, Kelton Inc. "If you didn't like price before you will probably like it now," he 
said. On the conference call, executives said there would be "de minimis" job reductions because of the addition 
of Neuberger's 1,250 employees. There is also a $95 million breakup fee Neuberger must pay if it terminates the 
merger agreement to accept a superior offer, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Neuberger is selling at 25.3 times expected 2003 earnings while Lehman on Monday was selling at 12 times 
expected earnings. Neuberger has also been losing assets of late, said analyst Richard Bove, of Hoefer & Arnett. 
Because the deal will close late this year, there will likely not be dilution to earnings for 2003. But Bove expects 
the transaction to dilute earnings next year by 3.8 percent. But Bove believes Lehman will make the deal work. 
About 90 percent of Lehman's sales force is transaction oriented, where they buy and sell stocks. "This sales 
force will be able to sell an array of fee based products and bring in money," Bove said. "This should both 
augment Neuberger's assets and increase the return on Lehman's sales." Private wealth management will now 
be 21 percent of Lehman's revenue, up from 13 percent, Tierney said. "This makes them a bigger player in that

business," he said. Lehman used its own mergers group for the deal while Simpson Thacher & Bartlett served as 
legal advisor. Greg Fleming, head of the financial institutions group at Merrill Lynch, led the deal for Neuberger.

Lehman finalises $2.6bn asset management acquisition 
Lehman finalises $2.6bn asset management acquisition

Lehman Brothers has agreed to pay $2.63bn (€2.3bn) for Neuberger Berman, the US asset management 
firm.The acquisition will expand Lehman's private client business and takes its assets under management to more 
than $100bn. Neuberger specialises in mutual funds, institutional accounts, and alternative investments. 
Analysts and investors will keep a close eye on how quickly the deal starts making money for Lehman. Bankers 
specializing in the financial services sector have been cautious about the potential for deals with asset 
management firms, believing that most are overvalued. 
Lehman paid $41.48 per share for Neuberger, a 2.5% premium to Monday's closing price but about 20% more 
than where the shares were trading before rumours of the deal surfaced one month ago. Lehman paid with 77% 
in its own stock and the balance in cash. 
But analysts say that Lehman's big incentive to buy Neuberger is the chance to diversify its sources of revenues. 
Lehman has become increasingly dependent on its bond business. The bank's fixed-income division contributed 
more than half of its revenues in the three months ended May 31, bringing in just under $1.2bn of revenues out of 
Lehman's total of $2.3bn. 
Richard Fuld, chairman and chief executive of Lehman said: "Strategically, this acquisition meets our objectives 
of enhancing business diversification and growing our higher margin businesses. Financially, we expect the 
combination to further improve our ability to generate consistent and attractive cross-cycle results." 
After the transaction closes, Neuberger Berman will become part of Lehman Brothers' wealth and asset

NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. on Tuesday said it will buy asset manager 
Neuberger Berman Inc. for $2.63 billion in a widely anticipated deal designed to help the Wall Street bank better 
compete for wealthy customers. 
The move beyond its traditional strengths in bond trading and underwriting comes at a time when Lehman is 
looking to broaden its revenue sources. 
The deal values Neuberger - which has over $63 billion in assets - at $41.48 per share, a 2.6 percent premium 
above the company's closing price on Monday. However, the price marks a 20.5 percent premium above 
Neuberger's trading price before the merger talks became public last month. 
"Neuberger has a big, high-net-worth client focus and that overlaps nicely with Lehman Brothers' retail, private 
client focus," said Jeffrey Harte, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. 
Lehman's shares fell 1.24 percent, or 80 cents, to close at $63.70 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Neuberger shares closed down 29 cents at $40.15. 
"The high-net-worth business is characterized by favorable demographics, growing demand for services ... and 
consistently high and sustained margins," Lehman Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Fuld said in a 
conference call. He added that building a similar business would be very difficult. 
Lehman's client assets under management will grow to over $100 billion - with about 40 percent in higher 
fee-generating equity investments - and will help provide a steadier stream of revenue than trading or stock 
underwriting. 
The New York investment bank said Neuberger CEO Jeffrey Lane, who has worked with Fuld in the past at 
Shearson Lehman, will become a vice chairman at Lehman, while the money management firm will keep its name 
and become part of Lehman's wealth and asset management unit. 
The high fees paid by wealthy investors make them attractive customers for banks and brokerages looking to 
build up consistent money-making businesses. On Tuesday, investment bank Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. said it hired 
two CIBC Oppenheimer executives to spearhead an effort to bring in more business from rich customers. 
SPREADING ITS WINGS 
Under Lehman's umbrella, Neuberger will for the first time be able to offer its products to an international 
audience, through the investment bank's global client base. 
Executives said they expect few layoffs from the merger since Neuberger's business and about 1,250 employees 
will essentially be added to Lehman's total of about 13,000 employees. 
To persuade top performers to stay at Neuberger, since in the past important employees have left merging firms, 
Lehman will set up a $120 million stock retention pool. 
Founded in 1939 by Roy Neuberger, the money manager is best known for its value-oriented mutual funds that 
take a conservative approach to investing. 
Lehman said it expects the merger to slightly lower per-share earnings in 2004 before breaking even in 2005.

Page 27 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The company expects the deal to generate $100 million in cost savings and additional revenue by the end of 
2005, with half of those synergies coming in 2004. 
Citing the merger, Standard & Poor's said they may raise Neuberger's credit ratings, while Fitch Ratings and 
Moody's Investors Service affirmed Lehman's ratings. 
The deal includes a $95 million break-up fee should either of the two sides fail to complete the merger. 
Bear Stearns analyst Daniel Goldberg said in a research note that the deal benefits Lehman with a big boost in 
the lucrative business of serving wealthy individuals, by expanding client assets overall and by increasing the 
firm's mutual fund offerings. 
Neuberger shareholders will receive $9.49 in cash and 0.496 shares of Lehman stock in the deal. The 
transaction includes a collar that will adjust the number of Lehman shares distributed if the investment bank's 
stock is above $66.51 during a period shortly before closing. 
With a number of state and federal regulatory approvals needed, Lehman said it expected the deal to close in its 
fiscal fourth quarter of 2003. (Additional reporting by Tom Johnson).

NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings on Tuesday said it agreed to buy asset manager 
Neuberger Berman for $2.6 billion, more than doubling the investment bank's client assets under management. 
The widely anticipated deal will allow Lehman to better compete with bigger rivals for wealthy customers and

The deal values Neuberger - which has over $63 billion in assets - at $41.48 per share, a 2.6 percent premium 
above the company's closing price on Monday. However, the price marks a 20.5 percent premium above

Lehman Brothers has finally pulled off the acquisition of Neuberger Berman. Dick Fuld, Lehman's chairman and 
chief executive, insists that his eagerness to buy an asset manager is nothing to do with timing the market. It is 
hard, however, to escape the conclusion that Lehman has taken advantage of a peak in its predominantly fixed 
income earnings to buy itself some diversification into equities. 
The headline price of $2.625bn is lower than the $3bn at first mooted. But throw in a $120m employee retention 
plan - you always have to buy an asset manager twice over - and another $66m of restricted employee stock, and 
the price starts to climb above 26 times 2003 earnings. But only a small portion of this is to be paid in cash. 
Three-quarters of the consideration comes in the form of Lehman stock - which has fallen by 8 per cent, against a 
broadly flat market, since the deal first began to be discussed publicly a month ago. 
It is this stock element that is key to Lehman's motivation for the deal. After a blow-out second quarter, Lehman 
has been trading at its highest valuations, relative to its investment banking peers and to the overall market, since 
it floated in 1994. The temptation to take advantage of this highly valued stock, and at a time when asset 
managers' valuations are more depressed, seems to have proved too great. Technology companies, media 
groups and mobile phone operators can, however, testify that overpaying in overvalued stock still means 
overpaying.

Lehman to Acquire Neuberger Berman in $2.63 Billion Deal

Moving to ease its dependence on bond trading and underwriting, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH) Tuesday 
said it agreed to acquire Neuberger Berman Inc. (NEU) in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $2.63 billion. 
Despite efforts to grow its presence in the equities arena, the sharp stock-market declines of the past few years 
has left Lehman largely dependent on its bonds business. The firms were reported to be in talks late last month to 
forge a deal that would help change that scenario. 
Under the agreement announced Tuesday, each Neuberger Berman shareholder would receive an implied price 
of $41.48 for each Neuberger share, comprising $9.49 in cash and 0.496 shares of Lehman Brothers common 
stock. 
The deal represents a 2.6% premium over Neuberger's share price of $40.44 at 4 p.m. Monday on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Lehman shares changed hands at $64.50 at 4 p.m. Monday, also on the Big Board. 
Lehman said the acquisition of Neuberger's private asset management business will leave it as one of the 
industry's leading providers of services to high-net-worth investors. 
"Neuberger Berman is an ideal partner for Lehman Brothers in every respect. Strategically, this acquisition meets 
our objectives of enhancing business diversification and growing our higher margin businesses," Lehman 
Brothers Chairman and Chief Executive Richard S. Fuld, Jr. said in a prepared statement. 
"By combining our industry-leading private wealth and asset management platform with Lehman Brothers' wide 
range of products and geographic scope, we can create an even greater array of opportunities together," Jeffrey 
B. Lane, Neuberger's president and CEO, noted. 
Mr. Lane will become a Lehman vice chairman, lead the wealth and management business, become chairman of 
the Neuberger Berman business as well as a member of Lehman's office of the chairman. Robert Matza will 
become president of Neuberger Berman and remain its chief operating officer. Mr. Matza also will join Lehman's 
Management Committee. 
Both firms' boards have approved the deal, which is expected to close in Lehman's fiscal fourth quarter, subject to 
approval of Neuberger shareholders. 
Neuberger, whose primary business is managing money for well-heeled investors through its 
private-asset-management group, had $63.7 billion in assets under management, as of June 30, 2003. 
Lehman's own mergers and acquisitions advisory group advised the firm in the deal, while and Neuberger 
Berman was advised by Merrill Lynch.

What A Small World: Neuberger's CEO Back In Lehman's Fold 
What A Small World: Neuberger's CEO Back In Lehman's Fold

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
WASHINGTON---(Dow Jones)- For Jeffrey B. Lane, the title of vice chairman at a company with the word Lehman 
in its name has a familiar ring. 
The 61-year-old president and chief executive of Neuberger Berman Inc. (NEU) is slated to become a vice 
chairman of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH) some time this fall, after Lehman completes its $2.6 billion 
acquisition of Neuberger. His new position comes nearly two decades after he served as vice chairman and chief 
operating officer at a predecessor company, Shearson Lehman Brothers. 
Lane's career path is an illustration of what a small world Wall Street can be, particularly if the majority of your 
work life was spent in the employ of Sanford Weill, a serial acquirer of financial services companies who now 
heads the mammoth Citigroup Inc. (C). It also provides insight into Lane's history of extreme loyalty to his 
superiors, a characteristic that should come in handy as he goes from heading his own publicly traded company 
to reporting to Richard S. Fuld Jr., chairman and chief executive of Lehman. 
Lane began his career at CBWL-Hayden Stone, the company founded and headed by Weill, and ended up 
working on and off for Weill until 1998, though the companies Weill controlled changed names quickly through 
mergers. By the mid-1980s, Lane was vice chairman and chief operating officer at Shearson Lehman Brothers, 
then a unit of American Express, whose president was Weill. Weill left American Express in 1985 after a power 
struggle, but Lane stayed, telling reporters that many long-time Shearson employees he spoke with had a "hollow 
feeling" at losing Weill, whom Lane called "our spiritual leader." 
Lane became president of Shearson Lehman in 1987, a post he held until he resigned in January 1990 after 
being demoted by then-Chairman and Chief Executive Peter Cohen, a longtime friend. 
When Cohen himself was ousted soon after, Lane described his former boss's downfall as a "business and 
human tragedy." 
Lane wasn't out of work for long. Less than two months later, he was snapped up by his old boss Weill, who had 
become head of Primerica Corp. since leaving American Express. Weill hired Lane to be president of the 
Primerica Holdings subsidiary, overseeing strategic planning for all of Primerica, with an emphasis on evaluating 
and advising the investment services and insurance businesses that made up Primerica Holdings. 
At the time, Lane said other companies had offered him more money, "but this was the best opportunity." 
Weill expanded his empire, adding on the Smith Barney brokerage; Shearson (but not Lehman) from American 
Express; and Travelers insurance. Lane continued to rise after each merger, becoming a vice chairman at Smith 
Barney in charge of asset management, then vice chairman and group executive at Travelers. 
Lane left Travelers in July 1998 to take the newly created position of chief administrative officer at Neuberger & 
Berman. In October 1999, when Neuberger & Berman held its initial public offering, he became its president and 
chief executive, a position he will continue to hold until later this year, when once again, he will work for a 
company with the word "Lehman" in its name.

By Cheryl Winokur Munk 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dipping a toe into the lucrative waters of asset management, Lehman Brothers 
Holdings Inc. (LEH) on Tuesday announced a $2.6 billion deal for Neuberger Berman Inc. (NEU). 
Lehman, which is a small player in the asset- management arena, has said for some time that it would like to 
increase that business, possibly through acquisition if the price and fit were right. The firm, which has done much 
of its growth internally, has been picky about acquisitions. 
Part of the allure of Neuberger is the assets it manages for wealthy individuals, which is a main focus for 
Lehman. Other asset managers that focus on this lucrative area are also on the watch list as acquisition targets. 
The Neuberger deal fits with Lehman's strategy of improving diversification and "furthers our objective of deriving 
a higher portion of our revenue from fee-based activities," said Richard Fuld Jr., chairman and chief executive of 
Lehman, on a conference call with analysts. 
With the addition of Neuberger's $63.7 billion, Lehman will have more than $100 billion of assets under 
management. Still, it pales in comparison with other Wall Street giants. Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER), for example, 
had $471 billion of assets under management at the end of its second quarter in June. Morgan Stanley (MWD) 
had $421 billion and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) had $346 billion at the end of their fiscal second quarter in 
May. 
Lehman will pay roughly 23% in cash and 77% in stock for Neuberger. The deal price, which some analysts 
believe is too lofty, includes $42 million in in-the-money options. It is less $255 million in net excess cash as of 
June 30 and excludes 1.6 million unvested restricted shares in employee compensation plans. Based on 
Monday's closing stock price, each Neuberger shareholder would receive an implied price of $41.48 a share 
consisting of $9.49 in cash and 0.496 shares of Lehman Brothers common stock. The number of shares received 
could change if Lehman's share price is above $66.51 during a period shortly prior to closing, subject to a collar. 
The deal, which requires various regulatory approvals as well as that of Neuberger shareholders, is expected to 
close during Lehman's fiscal fourth quarter. It includes a $120 million stock retention pool for key producers, 
subject to a five-year vesting period. The combination is expected to raise the percentage of revenue from 
Lehman's client services segment to 21% from 13% on a pro forma basis for 2002. 
Lehman said the deal will be slightly dilutive to earnings per share in 2004 and approximately break-even by 
2005. David Goldfarb, Lehman's chief financial officer, also said the job losses will be minimal from the 
combination. Neuberger is also subject to a $95 million breakup fee if it terminates the merger with Lehman to 
accept another proposal. 
As part of the deal, Neuberger's president and chief executive Jeffrey Lane will return to Lehman as a vice 
chairman and member of the office of the chairman. Lane, who spent his early years on Wall Street at Shearson 
Lehman, will also be chairman of Lehman's wealth and asset management division and chairman of Neuberger. 
Robert Matza will become president of Neuberger and remain its chief operating officer. He will also join 
Lehman's management committee.

Page 39 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"Lehman and Neuberger together are much stronger than either of the two companies separate," Lane said on 
the call. 
Ken Worthington, an analyst with CIBC World Markets Corp., said the deal "looks slightly better than we 
expected" for Neuberger shareholders. He said the deal was attractive to Neuberger because it had a hard time 
increasing its more profitable high-net worth business. Although he's not convinced Lehman will be able to help 
with that, as long as markets remain stable, he believes the deal will turn out well for the investment bank's 
shareholders. 
"They paid a reasonable price" as long as Neuberger gets 8% earnings growth for the next eight years, 
Worthington said. 
(He doesn't own shares of either company. CIBC also does not currently have an investment banking relationship 
with them.) 
Lehman served as its own adviser, while Neuberger was represented by Merrill Lynch. 
Shares of Lehman were down 1.2% to $63.72, while Neuberger was off 1.1% to $40.01.

UPDATE: Lehman Dips Into Asset Mgmt Waters With Neuberger

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dipping a toe into the lucrative world of asset management, Lehman Brothers 
Holdings Inc. (LEH) on Tuesday announced a $2.6 billion deal for Neuberger Berman Inc. (NEU). 
Lehman, which is a small player in the asset management arena, has said for some time that it would like to 
increase that business, possibly through acquisition if the price and fit were right. The firm, which has done much 
of its growth internally, has been picky about acquisitions. 
Part of the allure of Neuberger is the assets it manages for wealthy individuals, which is a main focus for 
Lehman. Other asset managers that focus on this lucrative area are also on the watch list as acquisition targets. 
The Neuberger deal fits with Lehman's strategy of improving diversification and "furthers our objective of deriving 
a higher portion of our revenue from fee-based activities," said Richard Fuld Jr., chairman and chief executive of 
Lehman, on a conference call with analysts. 
With the addition of Neuberger's $63.7 billion, Lehman will have more than $100 billion of assets under 
management. Still, it pales in comparison with other Wall Street giants. Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER), for example, 
had $471 billion of assets under management at the end of its second quarter in June. Morgan Stanley (MWD) 
had $421 billion and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) had $346 billion at the end of their fiscal second quarter in 
May. 
Lehman will pay roughly 23% in cash and 77% in stock for Neuberger. The deal price, which some analysts 
believe is too lofty, includes $42 million in in-the-money options. It is less $255 million in net excess cash as of 
June 30 and excludes 1.6 million unvested restricted shares in employee compensation plans. Based on 
Monday's closing stock price, each Neuberger shareholder would receive an implied price of $41.48 a share 
consisting of $9.49 in cash and 0.496 shares of Lehman Brothers common stock. The number of shares received 
could change if Lehman's share price is above $66.51 during a period shortly prior to closing, subject to a collar. 
The deal, which requires various regulatory approvals as well as that of Neuberger shareholders, is expected to 
close during Lehman's fiscal fourth quarter. It includes a $120 million stock retention pool for key producers, 
subject to a five-year vesting period. The combination is expected to raise the percentage of revenue from 
Lehman's client services segment to 21% from 13% on a pro forma basis for 2002. 
Lehman said the deal will be slightly dilutive to earnings per share in 2004 and approximately break-even by 
2005. David Goldfarb, Lehman's chief financial officer, also said the job losses will be minimal from the 
combination. Neuberger is also subject to a $95 million break-up fee if it terminates the merger with Lehman to 
accept another proposal. 
As part of the deal, Neuberger's president and chief executive Jeffrey Lane will return to Lehman as a vice 
chairman and member of the office of the chairman. Lane, who spent his early years on Wall Street at Shearson 
Lehman, will also be chairman of Lehman's wealth and asset management division and chairman of Neuberger. 
Robert Matza will become president of Neuberger and remain its chief operating officer. He will also join 
Lehman's management committee. 
"Lehman and Neuberger together are much stronger than either of the two companies separate," Lane said on 
the call.

A WALL STREET JOURNAL ONLINE NEWS ROUNDUP 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH) will acquire Neuberger Berman Inc. (NEU) in a 
cash-and-stock deal valued at $2.63 billion. 
Under the terms of the deal, Lehman will pay about $41.48 a share, consisting of $9.49 in cash and 0.496 shares 
of Lehman common stock. The price as announced represents a 2.6% premium over Neuberger's closing stock 
price Monday of $40.44. 
The companies will hold a conference call to discuss details of the deal Tuesday morning. 
Lehman Brothers said the number of shares received by Neuberger shareholders may be adjusted if Lehman 
stock is above $66.51 during a period shortly prior to closing, subject to a price collar. Lehman stock closed at 
$64.50 Monday. 
The companies were reported to be in talks late last month, with speculation that Lehman wanted to expand its 
reach in the investment-management business as it bet that individual investors were headed back into the 
market in large numbers. 
The acquisition would propel Lehman beyond its traditional trading and underwriting of bonds, setting it up to 
compete more aggressively with Wall Street rivals such as Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) and Morgan Stanley 
(MWD). Lehman has been criticized for relying too much on the bond market for revenue. While this strategy paid 
off as bond markets surged during a three-year stock-market swoon, Lehman is anxious to diversify its revenue 
stream. 
"If we found a good opportunity, we'd certainly pursue it, especially given the value of our currency today," said 
Lehman CEO Richard Fuld Jr. at an investor conference in June. 
The Neuberger acquisition represents a reversal of Lehman's strategy of distancing itself from individual 
investors, which represents a segment of Neuberger's business. In 1995, for instance, Lehman sold off about 
20,000 brokerage accounts with assets of less than $25,000 to rival Prudential Securities Inc. In recent years, 
Lehman's focus on individuals has centered on wealthy clients, most recently buying the "high net worth," or 
rich-investor, business of rival Societe Generale's (F.SGF) SG Cowen Securities in 2000. 
Lehman isn't the first suitor for Neuberger Berman, whose stock went public in 1999. One person familiar with the 
situation said last month that several financial institutions have expressed interest in the firm, though it wasn't 
clear if any of them would swoop in to prevent a Lehman deal.

(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH), seeking to lessen its reliance on bond trading 
and underwriting, agreed to acquire Neuberger Berman Inc. (NEU) in a cash-and-stock deal worth $2.63 billion. 
Lehman, which had confirmed early this month that it was in talks with Neuberger about a potential combination, 
said in a press release Tuesday that based on Monday's close each Neuberger shareholder would receive 
$41.48 a share consisting of $9.49 in cash and 0.496 of a Lehman common share. 
The offer represents a 2.5% premium to the close of Neuberger's shares Monday. The shares fell 2.3% to $40.44 
on the day. 
Lehman, which noted that the boards of both companies have approved the deal, said the acquisition of 
Neuberger's private asset management business will leave Lehman as one of the industry's leading providers of 
services to high-net-worth investors. 
Lehman said the 32 active Neuberger partners who lead most of the wealth-management teams will convert their 
Neuberger stock, including about $941 million in shares subject to transfer restrictions, into Lehman stock and 
cash on the same basis as the public shareholders. The Lehman stock they receive under the deal will be subject 
to the same restrictions. 
Lehman said it plans to set up a $120 million stock retention pool for key producers, which will be subject to 
vesting. 
Unlike a traditional brokerage firm with armies of brokers, Neuberger had just 43 brokers catering to wealthy 
clients at the end of last year. 
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that retention issues had become a focal point of the 
negotiations. Neuberger has talked to a number of suitors over the years, and talks have faltered before because 
potential suitors weren't willing to pay enough to retain key staff, the Journal reported, citing a person familiar with 
the matter. 
As part of the deal, Lehman will fold Neuberger into its client services segment's wealth and asset-management 
unit, which is led by Theodore P. Janulis. 
Neuberger President and Chief Executive Jeffrey B. Lane will become a vice chairman of Lehman, a member of 
the office of the chairman, chairman of the wealth and asset-management division and chairman of Neuberger. 
Robert Matza will become president of Neuberger and remain its chief operating officer. 
Lehman plans to discuss the planned acquisition in a conference call at 9:30 a.m. EDT. 
Lehman said the deal's $2.63 billion price tag includes $42 million in in-the-money options less $255 million in net 
excess cash at June 30 and excludes 1.6 million unvested restricted shares in employee compensation plans. 
Neuberger, which had $63.7 billion in assets under management at June 30, generated about 70% of its profits 
from its private-asset-management unit at the end of last year. 
Lehman said the acquisition would increase the amount of revenue its client-services unit contributed in 2002 to 
21% from 13% on a pro forma basis.

Page 44 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The company also said the deal will boost its client assets under management to more than $100 billion and will 
expand its capabilities in mutual funds, wrap accounts, institutional separate accounts and alternative 
investments. 
"Strategically, this acquisition meets our objectives of enhancing business diversification and growing our higher 
margin businesses," Lehman Chairman and Chief Executive Richard S. Fuld Jr. said in the statement. 
Lehman said the number of shares it will pay each Neuberger stockholder may be adjusted if Lehman shares 
rise above $66.51 shortly before closing. 
The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares traded recently at $64.89, up 39 cents, or 0.6%, on 
composite volume of 1.1 million shares. Average volume is 2.81 million shares a day. 
If the average stock price exceeds $66.51 but stays below $73, the deal calls for the exchange ratio to be 
modified so Neuberger shareholders get $42.50 a share. In case Lehman's shares exceed $73, the exchange 
ratio mechanics vary subject to a minimum exchange ratio of 0.411 if the average stock price surpasses $90.41. 
The company said the deal, which it expects will close in its fiscal fourth quarter, is set up to be tax-free to 
Neuberger shareholders. 
Lehman received advice from its own mergers and acquisitions group on the deal, while Neuberger sought 
advice from Merrill Lynch & Co Inc. (MER). 
Neuberger's Big Board-listed shares traded recently at $40.32, down 12 cents, or 0.3%, on composite volume of 
928,200 shares. Average daily volume is 452,629 shares.

excluding 1.6 million unvested restricted shares in employee compensation plans). Under the terms of the

implied price of $41.48 per share consisting of $9.49 in cash and 0.496 shares of Lehman Brothers common 
stock. The number of shares to be received by each Neuberger Berman shareholder may, however, be adjusted 
if the price of Lehman Brothers common stock is above $66.51 during a period shortly prior to closing, subject to 
a collar.

average stock price during that period were $66.51 or less. If the average stock price were greater than $66.51

Investors Balk at Lehman-Neuberger Talks --- Critics Suggest Acquisition Would Be a Smart Move But Price Tag Is Too High 
Investors Balk at Lehman-Neuberger Talks --- Critics Suggest Acquisition Would Be a Smart Move But 
Price Tag Is Too High 
By Susanne Craig and Tom Lauricella

3 July 2003 
The Asian Wall Street Journal 
AWSJ

English 
(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
In early June, Lehman Brothers Chief Executive Richard Fuld Jr. told an investor conference at Manhattan's 
Plaza Hotel that he was interested in buying a money-management firm if he could find one for sale "at the right 
price." 
Some on Wall Street believe he has found the right firm, but at a steep price. 
Since the disclosure last week that Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. is in advanced discussions to buy Neuberger 
Berman Inc. for about $3 billion in stock and cash, investors have spoken with their wallets. On Tuesday, Lehman 
shares slid 2.5% to $67.73 each in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange trading, even with a rally in brokerage 
stocks. The share price was down 1.2% during morning trading Wednesday. Neuberger shares rose 6% 
Tuesday to $39.90 on the Big Board and were up three cents Wednesday in morning trading. (Tuesday, Lehman 
confirmed it is talking with Neuberger about a "potential combination with that company.") 
"Sure it might be a good idea from a diversification standpoint, but at what cost to shareholders are they willing to 
do this deal?" said Paul Fusco, a senior research analyst with John Hancock Advisors, which owns 1.3 million 
Lehman shares, a holding that has remained unchanged during recent months. 
Lehman, keen to get away from its reliance on bond trading and underwriting, expanded its stock businesses 
between 1999 and 2001, in areas such as mergers-and-acquisitions advice and stock research. Despite its 
efforts, the broad stock-market decline of the past three years has left Lehman largely dependent on bonds. 
During the second quarter, for instance, about 65% of Lehman's revenue came from bond trading or underwriting. 
As a result, the firm has made no secret about its desire to broaden its business lines. Last year, it made an 
unsuccessful bid for finance company CIT Group. 
Among the most sought-after businesses these days on Wall Street are companies catering to the wealthiest 
investors, which is where Lehman has set its sights with its interest in Neuberger. A deal would partly reverse 
Lehman's strategy of distancing itself from individual investors; details of the transaction aren't expected to be 
announced this week, according to people familiar with the matter. 
There are legitimate reasons for investors to question the outcome of such a deal for Lehman. Wall Street is 
littered with problematic acquisitions of money-management firms by brokerage firms. Merrill Lynch & Co. still is 
working through problems -- including poor performance and employee and client defections -- arising from its 
1997 purchase of Mercury Asset Management of London. 
In a recent research note, financial analyst Brad Hintz of Sanford C. Bernstein said the $3 billion price tag for 
Neuberger is "mighty bold," suggesting in an interview that it should be closer to $2.7 billion. With Neuberger's 
$56.3 billion in assets as of March 31, the $3 billion purchase figure puts the deal's price to 
assets-under-management ratio at 5.3%, a much higher percentage than some other recent deals, which have 
come in at an average of about 3.2%. For instance, Charles Schwab Corp. last week agreed to buy the private 
money-management unit of State Street Corp. for $365 million, or about 3.2% of State Street's $11.5 billion in 
assets under management. 
Mr. Hintz said if Lehman pays $3 billion, it would achieve an internal rate of return of just 8.9% on the investment. 
However, if Lehman can negotiate the price down to about $2.7 billion, the deal's internal rate of return -- a 
measure that gauges the cash return on Lehman's investment -- would increase to about 12%, more in line with 
the return of its other businesses.

Neuberger, a person familiar with the matter said, has assets valued at between $62 billion and $63 billion, a 
bump-up that Mr. Hintz said would make the deal slightly more attractive to Lehman shareholders. He said 
Lehman doesn't have a history of overpaying for assets, which should give Lehman shareholders some solace as 
the negotiations progress. Neuberger declined to comment on its current asset level. 
A factor in the price that Lehman pays -- and ultimately in the success of any deal -- is the amount of money 
Lehman would have to set aside to retain Neuberger's top employees. Indeed, retention issues have become a 
central point in the current negotiations, according to a person familiar with the talks. Neuberger has talked to a 
number of suitors during the years, and talks have faltered before because potential suitors weren't willing to pay 
enough to retain important staff, a person familiar with the matter said. 
Neuberger's primary business is managing money for well-heeled investors through its 
private-asset-management group. Unlike a traditional brokerage firm with an army of brokers, Neuberger had just 
43 brokers catering to wealthy clients at the end of last year. 
With the private-asset-management unit generating almost 70% of Neuberger's profit as of the end of 2002, the 
success of an acquisition of Neuberger could hinge on Lehman's ability to retain those advisers, whose 
relationships with clients is paramount. 
The advisers, and to a greater extent the in-house money managers with whom they work closely, are large 
shareholders in Neuberger; 69% of the company is owned by employees and retired principals, who have been 
subject to a multiyear lockup limiting their ability to sell shares acquired when Neuberger went public during 
October 1999. The acquisition of Neuberger could free those employees to sell their stakes and walk unless they 
became subject to another lucrative lockup, analysts say. 
Lehman, according to people familiar with the matter, has been insistent in negotiations that, for the deal to work, 
all the active principals at Neuberger remain at the new company. Neuberger had no comment on the terms of 
the lockup. 
Money managers are notoriously quick to leave a firm if they believe they are being micromanaged. "It comes 
down to a question of autonomy," said Christopher Acito, a principal at Casey, Quirk & Acito, a 
money-management consulting firm in Darien, Connecticut. "If the money managers are allowed to remain 
autonomous within Lehman, then that becomes an easier acquisition." 
One factor that could make a union easier is the relatively short tenure of Neuberger's president, Jeffrey Lane. 
The 60-year-old executive joined Neuberger during July 1998 and has had plenty of experience working under 
the umbrella of big brokerage firms. He spent his early years on Wall Street at Shearson Lehman, where he rose 
through the ranks to serve as president in 1987-89. After the Travelers Group acquired parts of Shearson's 
businesses, Mr. Lane went to work for Citigroup Inc.'s chairman and CEO, Sanford Weill, heading up Smith 
Barney's asset-management group, eventually becoming a vice chairman. 
Another reason for Lehman to bargain for a better price is that there isn't much room for cost savings, said Robert 
Lee, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. Aside from some overlap between the prime brokerage 
businesses, there isn't much in the way of overlap to integrate, said Kenneth Worthington, who follows Lehman 
and Neuberger for CIBC World Markets. "It would need to be run largely as a separate company from Lehman."

Lehman Sets Sights on Neuberger Berman Despite Critics 
Lehman Sets Sights on Neuberger Berman Despite Critics

IN EARLY JUNE, Lehman Brothers Chief Executive Richard Fuld Jr. told an investor conference at Manhattan's 
Plaza Hotel that he was interested in buying a money-management firm if he could find one for sale "at the right 
price." 
Some on Wall Street believe he has found the right firm, but at a steep price. 
Since the disclosure last week on Thursday that Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. is in advanced discussions to buy 
Neuberger Berman Inc. for about $3 billion in stock and cash, investors have spoken with their wallets. Lehman 
shares have fallen 2.5% to $67.73 on the New York Stock Exchange, even with yesterday's rally in brokerage 
stocks. Neuberger shares have surged 6% to $39.90 on the Big Board. (Yesterday, Lehman confirmed it is 
talking with Neuberger about a "potential combination with that company.") 
"Sure it might be a good idea from a diversification standpoint, but at what cost to shareholders are they willing to 
do this deal?" says Paul Fusco, a senior research analyst with John Hancock Advisors, which owns 1.3 million 
Lehman shares, a holding that has remained unchanged in recent months. 
Lehman, keen to get away from its reliance on bond trading and underwriting, aggressively expanded its stock 
businesses between 1999 and 2001, in areas such as mergers-and-acquisitions advice and stock research. 
Despite its efforts, the broad stock-market decline of the past three years has left Lehman largely dependent on 
bonds. In the second quarter, for instance, about 65% of Lehman's revenue came from bond trading or 
underwriting. As a result, the firm has made no secret about its desire to broaden its business lines. Just last 
year, for example, it made an unsuccessful bid for finance company CIT Group. 
Among the most sought-after businesses these days on Wall Street are companies catering to the wealthiest 
investors, which is where Lehman has set its sights with its interest in Neuberger. A deal would partly reverse 
Lehman's strategy of distancing itself from individual investors; details of the transaction aren't expected to be 
announced this week, according to people familiar with the matter. 
There are legitimate reasons for investors to question the outcome of such a deal for Lehman. Wall Street is 
littered with problematic acquisitions of money-management firms by brokerage firms. Merrill Lynch &Co., for 
example, still is working through problems -- including poor performance and employee and client defections -- 
arising from its 1997 purchase of London-based Mercury Asset Management. 
In a recent research note, financial analyst Brad Hintz of Sanford C. Bernstein said the $3 billion price tag for 
Neuberger is "mighty bold," suggesting in an interview that it should be closer to $2.7 billion. With Neuberger's 
$56.3 billion in assets as of March 31, the $3 billion purchase figure puts the deal's price to 
assets-under-management ratio at 5.3%, a much higher percentage than some other recent deals, which have 
come in at an average of about 3.2%. For instance, Charles Schwab last week agreed to buy the private 
money-management unit of State Street Corp. for $365 million, or about 3.2% of State Street's $11.5 billion in 
assets under management.

investment. However, if Lehman can negotiate the price down to about $2.7 billion, the deal's internal rate of 
return -- a measure that gauges the cash return on Lehman's investment -- would increase to about 12%, more in

Lehman Appears to Advance Talks to Acquire Neuberger 
Lehman Appears to Advance Talks to Acquire Neuberger

Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., betting that individual investors are headed back into stocks, is in advanced 
discussions to buy investment manager Neuberger Berman Inc. for about $3 billion (2.6 billion euros) in stock 
and cash, according to people familiar with the situation. 
An acquisition of the money-management firm would propel Lehman Brothers Holdings beyond its traditional 
trading and underwriting of bonds, setting it up to compete more aggressively with Wall Street rivals such as 
Merrill Lynch & Co. and Morgan Stanley. Lehman has been criticized for relying too much on the bond market for 
revenue. While this strategy paid off as bond markets surged during a three-year stock-market swoon, Lehman is 
anxious to diversify its revenue stream. 
"If we found a good opportunity, we'd certainly pursue it, especially given the value of our currency today," said 
Lehman CEO Richard Fuld Jr. at an investor conference earlier this month. 
The talks still could collapse, and no board meetings have been set to approve any transaction, the people 
familiar with the situation said. Indeed, discussions between the two firms have been on and off for some time. 
But the talks recently have intensified. A Lehman spokeswoman declined to comment. Jeffrey Lane, Neuberger's 
president and chief executive, also declined to comment. 
A Neuberger acquisition would represent a reversal of Lehman's strategy of distancing itself from individual 
investors, which represents a segment of Neuberger's business. In 1995, for instance, Lehman sold off about 
20,000 brokerage accounts with assets of less than $25,000 to rival Prudential Securities Inc. In recent years, 
Lehman's focus on individuals has centered on wealthy clients, most recently buying the "high net worth," or 
rich-investor, business of rival Societe Generale's SG Cowen Securities in 2000. 
Some traders had believed Lehman would back away from this business, but that doesn't seem to be in the 
offing. In 2002, federal prosecutors charged Frank Gruttadauria, one of the brokers Lehman inherited from 
Cowen, with stealing millions of dollars from his clients. Mr. Gruttadauria currently is serving a seven-year prison 
term. 
Rumors about a potential deal circulated among investors Wednesday, sending shares of Neuberger Berman up 
9.2% on the New York Stock Exchange, while Lehman shares edged lower. 
Midafternoon Thursday, Neuberger Berman shares were up 8.1% at $40.65, while Lehman's were off 2.6% at 
$67.69. 
Lehman isn't the first suitor for Neuberger Berman, whose stock went public in 1999. A person familiar with the 
situation said several financial institutions have expressed interest in the firm, though it wasn't clear if any of them 
would swoop in to prevent a Lehman deal. Founded in 1939 to manage money for wealthy individuals, 
Neuberger Berman now manages $56.3 billion of assets. The firm had net income of $21.8 million, or 32 cents a 
share, in the quarter ended March 31. The bulk of its profit -- $27.1 million before taxes -- came from its 
private-asset division, compared with $18.1 million from mutual funds and institutional business. 
Neuberger still caters largely to wealthy clients, individuals with a minimum of $500,000 to invest. In addition, it 
has about $17 billion in mutual-fund assets under management, compared with total assets under management 
of approximately $56 billion. On the institutional side, Neuberger also manages money largely for foundations, 
endowments and corporate pension funds.

"Lehman is feasting on high but clearly unsustainable fixed-income revenue," says Reilly Tierney, an analyst at 
Fox-Pitt, Kelton in New York. "This type of deal would make sense for them, because it will help them sustain 
revenue when fixed income rolls over." 
In pursuing Neuberger Berman now, Lehman is also looking to snare a deal before prices get too rich. In the last 
round of big asset-management deals, companies such as Merrill Lynch made big acquisitions near the top of the 
bull market and are still struggling to make those deals pay off. Just Wednesday, Charles Schwab Corp. agreed 
to buy the private asset-management unit of State Street Corp. for $365 million. And last week, American Express 
Co., looking to expand its money-management business overseas, reached a deal to buy British-based 
Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings for about $570 million. 
Lehman has been on the prowl for acquisitions for a while, making an unsuccessful bid for CIT Group last year.

Shares of Neuberger Berman, a money manager that may sell itself to Lehman Brothers, rose 6.5 per cent to 
$40.05 yesterday. 
They have gained 16 per cent since word of talks between the two came out on Wednesday, and touched a 
52-week high of $41.17 yesterday. 
Investors are betting that Dick Fuld, Lehman chief executive, is eager to expand his asset management business 
and will buy Neuberger, which has $56.3bn under management. Lehman's goal is to persuade investors to see 
the company as more than a fixed-income trader. 
Talks continue, people involved in the transaction said, but an announcement is not imminent. 
The gain in shares is not expected to markedly change the amount of money Lehman would pay for Neuberger. 
Money management companies typically sell for between 1 per cent and 4 per cent of assets, though recent 
transactions and asking prices have pushed closer to the 5 per cent range, bankers and analysts said. This is 
especially the case when clients are wealthy and most of the assets are equity. About 55 per cent of Neuberger's 
assets are in equities and most clients have $500,000 or more to invest. 
Lehman and Neuberger Berman have talked of a price of about $3bn. Both declined to comment.

NEW YORK (AFX) - Lehman Bros. is in talks to acquire asset-management firm Neuberger Berman for about $3 
billion, a person familiar with the negotiations told CBS MarketWatch Thursday, and Neuberger shares surged to 
a 52-week high on news of the talks. Shares of Neuberger Berman raced as much as 9.5 percent higher to notch 
a 52-week high before closing at $40.05, up 6. 5 percent. If it completes the deal, Lehman is expected to cut its 
reliance on bond trading and underwriting. Neuberger, with $56.3 billion in assets under management, is known 
for managing the assets of high-net-worth individuals with accounts starting at $500,000. Lehman shares dropped 
$1.71, or 2.5 percent, to $67.77 Thursday. The asset-management space has seen other recent 
mergers-and-acquisitions activity. Earlier this week, Charles Schwab inked a deal to buy the private asset 
management unit of State Street Corp. for $365 million. 
Last week, American Express announced plans to acquire Threadneedle Asset Management for nearly $570 
million. Lehman is clearly seeking to replace its money-management division, said analyst Richard Bove, of 
Hoefer & Arnett. "Lehman's brokers are among the highest producers in the industry, but they may not be as 
profitable as they could be," Bove wrote in a research note. "This is because 90 percent of their business is 
believed to be transaction-oriented, and only 10 percent comes from fixed fees." Last week, Lehman said 
second-quarter revenue from fixed income jumped to $1.19 billion from $676 million. The New York-based 
securities firm is also preparing for the day when its fixed-income business weakens, Bove said. In December, 
Lehman purchased the fixed-income money-management division of Lincoln Capital. Lehman "sees money 
management as a good offset to fixed-income trading," Bove said. While the market rebound of the past two 
months has helped, the past few years have been hard for all asset managers, said analyst Robert Lee of Keefe, 
Bruyette & Woods. "There have been pressure on assets and on fee rates," Lee said. The $3 billion price is "in 
line" with expectations, he said. Neuberger declined to comment. A return If Lehman and Neuberger were to join 
forces, it would represent the height of irony for the firms. Some time ago, when American Express was building 
its brokerage operations, it owned both Lehman Bros. and Shearson Hammill. Jeff Lane, the current Neuberger 
chief operating officer, held that same position with the American Express brokerage operation. Robert Matza, 
Neuberger's current COO, was chief financial officer under Lane. Richard Fuld, Lehman's chief executive, 
ascended to prominence in 1989 when he became president of Shearson Lehman. He also succeeded Lane in 
the position. "All of these people have known each other for decades and have worked together in the past, " 
Bove said. Amex in 1994 spun off Lehman into an independent, separately traded company. Shearson in 1992 
was sold back to Sanford Weill, who merged it with Smith Barney. Weill is now Chairman and CEO of Citigroup.

a 52-week high on news of the talks. Shares of Neuberger Berman raced as much as 9.5 percent higher to notch 
a 52-week high before changing hands more recently at $40.81, up 8.5 percent. If it completes the deal, Lehman 
is expected to cut its reliance on bond trading and underwriting. Neuberger, with $56.3 billion in assets under 
management, is known for managing the assets of high-net-worth individuals with accounts starting at $500,000. 
News of the negotiations caused Neuberger's stock to surge nearly 9 percent, or $3.29, to $40.89 in afternoon 
trading Thursday. Lehman shares dropped $1. 89, or 2.7 percent, to $67.59. The asset-management space has 
seen other recent mergers-and-acquisitions activity. 
Earlier this week, Charles Schwab inked a deal to buy State Street Corp. for $365 million. Last week, American 
Express announced plans to acquire Threadneedle Asset Management for nearly $570 million. Lehman is clearly 
seeking to replace its money-management division, said analyst Richard Bove, of Hoefer & Arnett. "Lehman's 
brokers are among the highest producers in the industry, but they may not be as profitable as they could be," 
Bove wrote in a research note. "This is because 90 percent of their business is believed to be 
transaction-oriented, and only 10 percent comes from fixed fees." Last week, Lehman said second-quarter 
revenue from fixed income jumped to $1.19 billion from $676 million. The New York-based securities firm is also 
preparing for the day when its fixed-income business weakens, Bove said. In December, Lehman purchased the 
fixed-income money-management division of Lincoln Capital. Lehman "sees money management as a good 
offset to fixed-income trading," Bove said. While the market rebound of the past two months has helped, the past 
few years have been hard for all asset managers, said analyst Robert Lee of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. "There 
have been pressure on assets and on fee rates," Lee said. The $3 billion price is "in line" with expectations, he 
said. Neuberger declined to comment. A return If Lehman and Neuberger were to join forces, it would represent 
the height of irony for the firms. Some time ago, when American Express was building its brokerage operations, it 
owned both Lehman Bros. and Shearson Hammill. Jeff Lane, the current Neuberger chief operating officer, held 
that same position with the American Express brokerage operation. Robert Matza, Neuberger's current COO, 
was chief financial officer under Lane. Richard Fuld, Lehman's chief executive, ascended to prominence in 1989 
when he became president of Shearson Lehman. He also succeeded Lane in the position. "All of these people 
have known each other for decades and have worked together in the past," Bove said. Amex in 1994 spun off 
Lehman into an independent, separately traded company. Shearson in 1992 was sold back to Sanford Weill, who 
merged it with Smith Barney. Weill is now Chairman and CEO of Citigroup. This story was supplied by

NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a leading Wall Street firm, is in talks to buy 
asset management firm Neuberger Berman Inc. for about $3 billion, a source familiar with the matter said on 
Thursday. 
Officials at both companies declined to comment. 
If completed, an acquisition would allow Lehman to establish a bigger presence in the asset management 
business and move beyond its traditional strengths of bond trading and underwriting. Money management is seen 
as providing a steadier stream of revenue than trading or stock underwriting. 
"Lehman is clearly seeking new sources of revenue to prepare for the day when fixed income trading weakens," 
said Richard Bove, an analyst at Hoefer & Arnett, who said he thinks a deal with Neuberger is likely. 
Once acquired, Neuberger could add 22 cents to Lehman's 2004 per-share earnings, Merrill Lynch analyst Guy 
Moszkowski said in a research note. 
Neuberger shares jumped $3.33, or 8.9 percent, to $40.93 while Lehman shares were off $1.33, or 1.9 percent, 
at $68.15 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Founded in 1939 by art buff Roy Neuberger, the New York-based company focuses on wealthy clients and has 
about $56.3 billion under management. Like most of the industry, it has suffered during the stock market decline 
and posted falling revenue and fewer assets. 
FORMER COLLEAGUES 
Several top executives at the firms are linked by their connections to American Express Co., when it owned 
Lehman's predecessor companies. 
Neuberger Chief Executive Jeff Lane was chief operating officer of American Express' brokerage unit, while 
Lehman CEO Richard Fuld was in its investment banking group, Bove said. 
There has been a modest flow of deals recently among asset management companies. Charles Schwab Corp. on 
Wednesday said it agreed to buy State Street Corp.'s private asset management unit for $365 million. American 
Express Co. earlier this month agreed to buy UK fund manager Threadneedle from insurer Zurich Financial 
Services for $570 million.

Lehman Talks With Neuberger About a Deal --- Bond Powerhouse Looks to Follow Individual Investors Returning To Market in $3 Billion Proposal 
Lehman Talks With Neuberger About a Deal --- Bond Powerhouse Looks to Follow Individual Investors 
Returning To Market in $3 Billion Proposal

LEHMAN BROTHERS Holdings Inc., betting that individual investors are headed back into stocks, is in advanced 
discussions to buy investment manager Neuberger Berman Inc. for about $3 billion in stock and cash, according 
to people familiar with the situation. 
An acquisition of the money-management firm would propel Lehman Brothers Holdings beyond its traditional 
trading and underwriting of bonds, setting it up to compete more aggressively with Wall Street rivals such as 
Merrill Lynch &Co. and Morgan Stanley. Lehman has been criticized for relying too much on the bond market for 
revenue. While this strategy paid off as bond markets surged during a three-year stock-market swoon, Lehman is 
anxious to diversify its revenue stream. 
"If we found a good opportunity, we'd certainly pursue it, especially given the value of our currency today," said 
Lehman CEO Richard Fuld Jr. at an investor conference earlier this month. 
The talks still could collapse, and no board meetings have been set to approve any transaction, the people 
familiar with the situation said. Indeed, discussions between the two firms have been on and off for some time. 
But the talks recently have intensified. A Lehman spokeswoman declined to comment. Jeffrey Lane, Neuberger's 
president and chief executive officer, also declined to comment. 
A Neuberger acquisition would represent a reversal of Lehman's strategy of distancing itself from individual 
investors, which represents a segment of Neuberger's business. In 1995, for instance, Lehman sold off about 
20,000 brokerage accounts with assets of less than $25,000 to rival Prudential Securities Inc. In recent years, 
Lehman's focus on individuals has centered on wealthy clients, most recently buying the "high net worth," or 
rich-investor, business of rival Societe Generale's SG Cowen Securities in 2000. 
Some traders had believed Lehman would back away from this business, but that doesn't seem to be on the 
offing. In 2002, federal prosecutors charged Frank Gruttadauria, one of the brokers Lehman inherited from 
Cowen, with stealing millions of dollars from his clients. Mr. Gruttadauria currently is serving a seven-year prison 
term. 
Rumors about a potential deal circulated among investors yesterday, sending shares of Neuberger Berman up 
$3.17, or 9.2%, to $37.60 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Lehman shares fell 76 cents to 
$69.48 in an overall down day for the markets. 
Lehman isn't the first suitor for Neuberger Berman, whose stock went public in 1999. One person familiar with the 
situation said several financial institutions have expressed interest in the firm, though it wasn't clear if any of them 
would swoop in to prevent a Lehman deal. 
Founded in 1939 to manage money for wealthy individuals, Neuberger Berman now manages $56.3 billion of 
assets. The firm had net income of $21.8 million, or 32 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31. The bulk of 
its profit -- $27.1 million before taxes -- came from its private-asset division, compared with $18.1 million from 
mutual funds and institutional business. 
Neuberger still caters largely to wealthy clients, individuals with a minimum of $500,000 to invest. In addition, it 
has about $17 billion in mutual-fund assets under management, compared with total assets under management 
of approximately $56 billion. On the institutional side, Neuberger also manages money largely for foundations, 
endowments and corporate pension funds.

"Lehman is feasting on high but clearly unsustainable fixed-income revenue," says Reilly Tierney, an analyst at 
Fox-Pitt, Kelton in New York. "This type of deal would make sense for them, because it will help them sustain 
revenue when fixed income rolls over." 
In pursuing Neuberger Berman now, Lehman is also looking to snare a deal before prices get too rich. In the last 
round of big asset-management deals, companies such as Merrill Lynch made big acquisitions near the top of the 
bull market and are still struggling to make those deals pay off. 
Just yesterday, Charles Schwab Corp. agreed to buy the private asset-management unit of State Street Corp. for 
$365 million. And last week, American Express Co., looking to expand its money-management business 
overseas, reached a deal to buy British-based Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings for about $570 million. 
Lehman has been on the prowl for acquisitions for a while, making an unsuccessful bid for CIT Group last year.

Purchase brings Fuld closer to realising dream - NEUBERGER BERMAN.

Buying money manager Neuberger Berman would put Lehman's chief executive, Dick Fuld, closer to his goal of 
getting investors to think of his investment bank as more than just a fixed-income house, something he has 
pursued since Lehman was spun off from American Express in 1994. 
Mr Fuld has invested in the firm's equity trading and underwriting business, expanded abroad, and hired 
investment bankers to hammer away at the market share held by rivals such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan 
Stanley in the mergers and acquisition business. 
But he has not as yet created a sizeable asset management business. He took a small step into the market with 
the purchase of the fixed-income capital management business of Lincoln Capital Management in January, but 
that transaction was nowhere near the size of Neuberger Berman's $56.3bn of assets. 
Talks with Neuberger Berman are ongoing, say people involved with the transaction. The price could be about 
$3bn, they say. 
Neuberger Berman has been unable to significantly increase earnings since its October 1999 initial share sale, 
thanks in large part to the three-year bear market in stocks. But it has a list of wealthy clients and talented money 
managers that could serve as a good foundation for Mr Fuld to build an asset management business, if he can 
get the personalities to mesh, analysts said. 
The business also has a team of analysts untainted by the Wall Street research settlement and covers about 190 
stocks. 
Lehman and other financial services firms are eager to enter the money management businesses because the 
units generally provide a steady stream of fees that can be used to offset swings in other areas. 
Its former owner, American Express, agreed to purchase Threadneedle Asset Management, one of London's 
best-known fund managers, for about $540m earlier this month. 
Neuberger Berman would put Lehman closer to rivals, but not that close. Goldman has $346bn in assets under 
management, more than six times that of Neuberger. But Neuberger Berman, in addition to assets, does have a 
strong reputation and recognisable name. 
Roy Neuberger founded the firm that became Neuberger Berman in 1939. His idea was to manage money for 
wealthy individuals, a business that would in turn make him enough money to collect art. He was a success on 
both counts given that part of his collection of 20th century art is in a museum at the State University of New York 
at Purchase. 
Lehman declined to comment and a spokesman for Neuberger did not return a call seeking comment.

Lehman Brothers is in talks to acquire Neuberger Berman, the New York-based asset manager, for about $3bn, 
according to people involved in the transaction. 
Negotiations are at an advanced stage but an announcement is not expected this week and the talks could still 
fall apart. 
Dick Fuld, Lehman's chief executive, has stated his interest in rebuilding an asset management business which 
the bank has been without since being spun off from American Express in 1994. 
Lehman made its first move in January when it bought the fixed-income capital management business of Lincoln 
Capital. 
Jeff Lane, Neuberger's chairman and chief executive, has been looking for a buyer in part because the company 
has struggled to grow since its October 1999 initial public offering. It currently has about $56.3bn under 
management. 
Other Wall Street investment banks have also been looking to expand in money management, which provides a 
more reliable income stream than volatile underwriting and merger advice. Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Merrill 
Lynch, said: "It probably is the best business in financial services." 
Lehman is not expected to pay much more than Neuberger's market value of $2.64bn. The shares rose 9 per 
cent to a 52-week high of $39.20 yesterday. 
Lehman will have to convince senior management that the cultures of the two companies will fit, including 
vice-chairman Marvin Schwartz, who is the largest individual shareholder, with 6 per cent. Renowned investor 
Roy Neuberger founded the firm that became Neuberger Berman in 1939.

Lehman Brothers is in talks to acquire Neuberger Berman, the New York-based asset manager, for about $3bn, 
according to people involved in the transaction. 
Negotiations are ongoing and an announcement is not likely to be made this week, the people said, adding that 
talks could still fall apart. Lehman declined to comment and a spokesman for Neuberger did not return a call 
seeking comment. 
Neuberger Berman manages about $56.3bn in assets. Jeff Lane, its chairman and chief executive, is said to 
have been offering the company to buyers in part because it has not been able to grow assets under 
management or earnings significantly since its October 1999 initial share sale. 
A purchase would be Lehman's second of an asset manager this year. The investment bank bought the 
fixed-income capital management business of Lincoln Capital Management in January. 
Chief executive Dick Fuld has said he is interested in buying asset managers - a business Lehman has been 
largely out of since being spun off from American Express - for the right price. 
Wall Street investment banks have been eager to enter or expand their money management businesses. The 
units provide a steady stream of fees that can be used to offset swings in other areas such as underwriting and 
advising on mergers, are not capital intensive, and grow with the markets, said analysts. 
"Asset management is a terrific business," said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. "It probably is the 
best business in financial services. This is why investment banks want to get involved." 
But it is also why people stay out, he said, because the companies often sell at a very high price. He declined to 
comment specifically about Lehman and Neuberger. Lehman is not expected to pay much more than 
Neuberger's market value of $2.64bn. 
Shares of Neuberger reached a 52-week high of $39.20 yesterday as investors speculated it had found a buyer. 
Still, many people will have to be convinced of the merits of the transaction, including fund manager and 
vice-chairman Marvin Schwartz, who is the largest individual shareholder, according to Securities and Exchange 
Commission filings. As of May, he owned about 4.29m shares, or 6.1 per cent of those outstanding. Citigroup is 
listed as the largest shareholder. 
Renowned investor Roy Neuberger founded the firm that became Neuberger Berman in 1939. 
His idea was to manage money for wealthy individuals, a business that would in turn make him enough money to 
collect art. 
In 1950, Neuberger Berman became one of the first firms to sell no-load mutual funds to individual investors. 
Neuberger Berman has a respected research department that covers 190 stocks.

Shares of Neuberger Berman, a money manager that may sell itself to Lehman Brothers, rose 6.5 per cent to 
$40.05 on Thursday. 
They have gained 16 per cent since word of talks between the two came out on Wednesday, and touched a 
52-week high of $41.17 on Thursday. 
Investors are betting that Dick Fuld, Lehman chief executive, is eager to expand his asset management business 
and will buy Neuberger, which has $56.3bn under management. Lehman's goal is to persuade investors to see 
the company as more than a fixed-income trader. 
Talks continue, people involved in the transaction said, but an announcement is not imminent. 
The gain in shares is not expected to markedly change the amount of money Lehman would pay for Neuberger. 
Money management companies typically sell for between 1 per cent and 4 per cent of assets, though recent 
transactions and asking prices have pushed closer to the 5 per cent range, bankers and analysts said. This is 
especially the case when clients are wealthy and most of the assets are equity. About 55 per cent of Neuberger's 
assets are in equities and most clients have $500,000 or more to invest. 
Lehman and Neuberger Berman have talked of a price of about $3bn. Both declined to comment.

Buying money manager Neuberger Berman would put Lehman's chief executive, Dick Fuld, closer to his goal of 
getting investors to think of his investment bank as more than just a fixed-income house, something he has 
pursued since Lehman was spun off from American Express in 1994. 
Mr Fuld has invested in the firm's equity trading and underwriting business, expanded abroad, and hired 
investment bankers to hammer away at the market share held by rivals such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan 
Stanley in the mergers and acquisition business. 
But he has not as yet created a sizeable asset management business. He took a small step into the market with 
the purchase of the fixed-income capital management business of Lincoln Capital Management in January, but 
that transaction was nowhere near the size of Neuberger Berman's $56.3bn of assets. 
Talks with Neuberger Berman are ongoing, say people involved with the transaction. The price could be about 
$3bn, they say. 
Neuberger Berman has been unable to significantly increase earnings since its October 1999 initial share sale, 
thanks in large part to the three-year bear market in stocks. But it has a list of wealthy clients and talented money 
managers that could serve as a good foundation for Mr Fuld to build an asset management business, if he can 
get the personalities to mesh, analysts said. 
The business also has a team of analysts untainted by the Wall Street research settlement and covers about 190 
stocks. 
Lehman and other financial services firms are eager to enter the money management businesses because the 
units generally provide a steady stream of fees that can be used to offset swings in other areas. 
Its former owner, American Express, agreed to purchase Threadneedle Asset Management, one of London's 
best-known fund managers, for about $540m earlier this month. 
Neuberger Berman would put Lehman closer to rivals, but not that close. Goldman has $346bn in assets under 
management, more than six times that of Neuberger. But Neuberger Berman, in addition to assets, does have a 
strong reputation and recognisable name. 
Roy Neuberger founded the firm that became Neuberger Berman in 1939. His idea was to manage money for 
wealthy individuals, a business that would in turn make him enough money to collect art. He was a success on 
both counts given that part of his collection of 20th century art is in a museum at the State University of New York 
at Purchase. 
Lehman declined to comment and a spokesman for Neuberger did not return a call seeking comment.
