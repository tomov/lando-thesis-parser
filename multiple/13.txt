United States Steel Corporation announced that it has completed the acquisition of Stelco Inc. and that Stelco 
has been renamed U.S. Steel Canada Inc. Commenting on the acquisition, U.S. Steel Chairman and CEO John 
Surma said, "We welcome the customers, employees and communities of Stelco to the U. S. Steel family. This 
acquisition expands the footprint of our North American flat-rolled operations with facilities on both sides of the 
Great Lakes to better respond to customer needs, including the ability to process U.S. Steel Canada slabs at 
other U.S. Steel facilities." In this transaction, each share of Stelco common stock has been converted into the 
right to receive $38.50 Canadian per share, and warrants to acquire Stelco common stock have been converted 
into the right to receive $27.50 Canadian. CIBC Mellon Trust Company has been appointed Depositary for both 
common stock and warrants. 
Holders of common stock and warrants should submit certificates for their common stock and warrants together 
with the required letter of transmittal to the Depositary. Questions can be directed to the Depositary at (800) 
387-0825. U.S. Steel has financed the acquisition cost of approximately $1.2 billion and the refinancing of 
approximately $750 million of existing Stelco debt through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under a 
$500 million three-year term loan and a $400 million one-year term loan, and $400 million of sales under a 
receivables purchase agreement that expires in 2010. In addition, U.S. Steel named the management team for 
U.S. Steel Canada. Douglas R. Matthews has been named president and general manager- U.S. Steel Canada; 
William C. Harrison has been named vice president and chief financial officer- U.S. Steel Canada; Charles J. 
Shuster has been named director-human resources, U.S. Steel Canada; Scott D. Buckiso has been named plant 
manager-Lake Erie Works; and Bryan P. Vaughn has been named plant manager-Hamilton Works. The changes 
are effective immediately. "The leadership team that will oversee U.S. Steel Canada is composed of individuals 
with strong, diverse backgrounds acquired during years of service at U.S. Steel facilities in the United States and 
Central Europe," said Surma. "Their experience, coupled with the talents and expertise of the employees they will 
work side-by-side with, will help ensure a smooth transition for the operations and the customers they serve." 
Matthews arrives in Canada from U.S. Steel Serbia, an integrated steelmaking operation with annual raw steel 
production capability of 2.4 million net tons. As vice president and general director of U.S. Steel Serbia since May 
2006, he has been responsible for overseeing all activities at facilities in Smederevo, Sabac and Kucevo. 
Harrison has spent the last four years serving as controller at Great Lakes Works near Detroit, Mich. Shuster was 
recently promoted to manager of employee relations for Mon Valley Works, which has facilities near Pittsburgh 
and Philadelphia, Pa., after spending nearly one and a half years in the same role at Great Lakes Works. Buckiso 
has acted as general manager-finishing at U.S. Steel Serbia's Smederevo location since September 2006. 
Vaughn has served as plant manager for the Irvin Plant and Fairless Plant, Mon Valley Works' finishing facilities 
located just outside Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, Pa., respectively, since June 2006. Additional Biographical

US Steel’s acquisition of Stelco is expected to be finalised soon now that it has received all regulatory clearances 
from the US and Canada. The Canadian Minister of Industry approved the deal yesterday, Steel Business 
Briefing learns. 
As part of the deal with the Canadian government, US Steel agreed to increases in production and exports from 
Canada as well as making significant capital expenditures at Stelco's facilities. It has also agreed to funding 
commitments toward Stelco's pension plan. 
"We are pleased with this news which confirms that the Minister of Industry is satisfied that US Steel's acquisition 
of Stelco will be of net benefit to Canada,” says John Surma.

American steelmaker U.S. Steel has announced that it has purchased Canadian steelmaker Stelco in a deal 
worth US$1.1 billion. "With major facilities located on both sides of the Great Lakes, this acquisition will 
significantly increase our ability to respond to market demands and our customers' needs," said U.S. Steel CEO 
John Surma in a statement. The move is expected to strengthen U.S. Steel's automotive business, despite 
acquiring a company that lost US$187 million for 2006 due to reductions in automotive business. The move will 
increase U.S. Steel's steelmaking capacity from 26.8 to 33.0 million tons, with 25 million of it in North America. 
The deal, which is expected to close by year-end, would make U.S. Steel the fifth-largest steelmaker in the 
world.Significance: The shake-up of the North American steel industry is largely over, with massive bankruptcies, 
consolidations, and then skyrocketing prices now being followed by a period of calming prices and slower 
acquisitions. 
Stelco emerged from bankruptcy in March 2006, but is not yet profitable. Presumably the economies seen by 
combining the two companies and eliminating overlapping areas will help to bolster U.S. Steel's revenues.

Stelco's new owners eased concerns yesterday that the company's Hamilton operations and jobs might be in 
jeopardy. 
Only hours after announcing a definitive agreement to buy the struggling steel giant, senior United States Steel 
Corp. officials told union leaders they plan to invest in operations and maintain job levels. 
Wayne Fraser, director of the Ontario and Atlantic divisions of the United Steelworkers, said U.S. Steel plans to 
invest $100 million to upgrade the Hamilton site, including a pickle line and coke works, in efforts to fully utilize 
operations. 
"They told us that it didn't make sense to do a deal like this unless there was full utilization of the steel-making 
capabilities at Hamilton," Fraser said in an interview after the meeting. "The investment will happen sooner or 
later." 
A cloud has hung over the future of the once-mighty Hamilton operations for several years because of a lack of 
investment in replacing aging equipment and adding new technology. 
U.S. Steel officials, including chief executive officer John Surma, also assured the union that the current 
workforce level of about 3,600 at Stelco's Hamilton and Lake Erie operations would remain relatively stable, 
according to Fraser. 
"They seemed sincere," he said. "I'm optimistic. It should be good news." 
Stelco has already slashed its workforce by more than 2,500 jobs since early 2004 through asset sales, 
shutdowns and early retirements. 
U.S. Steel announced with Stelco late Sunday that it will buy the Hamilton-based steel maker for $38.50 a share 
in cash, or about $1.15 billion. Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel will also assume $760 million (U.S.) in debt. 
The two companies also said Stelco's four biggest shareholders - Tricap Management, Sunrise Partners LP, 
Appaloosa Management LP and the steel maker's chief executive officer Rodney Mott - have agreed to the sale. 
They hold more than 76 per cent of Stelco's stock. 
The offer represents a 43 per cent premium on Stelco's closing price on the Toronto Stock Exchange last Friday. 
After the announcement, the stock price zoomed up $10.70, or 39.7 per cent, to close at $37.63 in trading 
yesterday. 
Stelco, a Canadian industrial icon for almost a century, becomes the last of the country's big four steel makers to 
fall into foreign hands as part of an international consolidation trend sweeping the sector during the last two years. 
The company gained court protection from creditors in 2004 and emerged last year as a smaller company with 
less debt after a protracted restructuring. 
Mott, a turnaround specialist in the steel industry, has worked on cutting Stelco's unprofitable operations and 
trimming the workforce further to improve productivity.

Page 13 of 48 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Stelco posted five-consecutive quarters of net losses since pulling out of court protection, but Mott said yesterday 
the company is now making money. 
Surma also noted that it appears Stelco's financial fortunes are improving. 
"I think we're moving in at the right time because all those projects are starting to bear fruit," he said. 
Surma said Stelco fits well with U.S. Steel because slab output from Hamilton and Lake Erie will expand his 
company's semi-finished capabilities to feed its finishing facilities for both flat-rolled and tubular products south of 
the border. Stelco produces about 4.2 million tons of raw steel annually. 
U.S. Steel expects annual pre-tax synergies of more than $100 million (U.S.) as a result of the acquisition. 
Stelco also has joint-venture interests in iron ore operations in Canada and the U.S. plus a stake in a leading 
edge galvanizing line. 
Surma said U.S. Steel was impressed with Stelco's productivity improvements and competitive slab costs at the 
Hamilton operations. 
"I think we're going to be just fine," he said. 
Fraser said U.S. Steel also told the union that it will strive to make sure pension plans are fully funded well before 
a 2015 target date. 
The company has agreed to add a letter to the union's contracts to seal management's commitments, Fraser 
noted. 
Gretchen Haggerty, chief financial officer for U.S. Steel, told analysts earlier that the company plans to make 
"significant" capital expenditures at Stelco's Hamilton and Lake Erie operations. 
Furthermore, Haggerty said U.S. Steel will guarantee Stelco's pension funding obligations with the Ontario 
government and also make a voluntary contribution of $31 million to employee plans. 
However, Ontario New Democrat Leader Howard Hampton said the sale is not in the long-term interests of the 
province's economy. 
The sale won't have much impact when the economy is humming, but when conditions decline the Hamilton 
operations face job cuts, he told reporters at Queen's Park yesterday. 
"I find it disturbing that some of Canada's and Ontario's leading companies, whether it be Inco, Falconbridge, 
Stelco, Dofasco, have all been sold off under the McGuinty government and the decisions will no longer be made 
in Ontario," Hampton added. 
"The decisions will be made in places like Brazil, Switzerland or the United States. In the long-term that's going to 
come back to bite us."

PITTSBURGH 
United States Steel Corp. is buying the Canadian steel maker Stelco Inc. for about $1.1 billion in a move 
expected to bolster its position as a supplier to the North American automotive industry. 
The Pittsburgh-based company said slabs produced at Stelco's Lake Erie and Hamilton plants will supply 
finishing facilities for flat-rolled steel - used in the auto and appliance industries - and tubular steel used mostly in 
the energy sector. 
After the acquisition, U.S. Steel will become the world's fifth-largest steel maker. It will have with a production 
capacity of about 33 million net tons of raw steel annually, up from its currently yearly capacity of 26.8 million 
tons. 
Stelco emerged from bankruptcy protection last year and announced plans to cut 15 percent of its work force. 
John Surma, U.S. Steel's chairman and chief executive, said the deal would increase U.S. Steel's ability to 
respond to market demands and customer needs. 
"We have some optimism about the long-term outlook for North American steel," he said in a conference call 
Monday. "(Stelco) fits nicely into our Midwestern consumption patterns." 
Global steel makers have been consolidating in recent years to deal with intense competition, the need for major 
reinvestment in aging mills and new opportunities in Asia. 
Last year, U.S. Steel bought Texas-based Lone Star Technologies Inc., which makes welded pipe used in oil 
fields, for $2 billion. 
Charles Bradford, an industry analyst with Bradford Research/Soliel Securities in New York, said the acquisition 
would strengthen U.S. Steel's position in the automotive sector. 
He noted that the automotive industry accounted for the largest portion of Stelco's business, and that the 
combination would raise U.S. Steel's automotive industry shipments from 18 percent to 22 percent of total 
business. 
The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, subject to review by regulators.

UPDATE 5- US Steel to acquire Stelco for $1.1 bln (Adds CEO, analyst comments, updates stock prices) 
By Michael Erman and Jonathan Spicer 
New York/TORONTO, Aug 27 Reuters - US Steel Corp agreed to acquire Stelco Inc for $1.1 billion, bagging the 
last big Canadian-owned steelmaker and strengthening its position in flat-rolled steel products in North America. 
Chief Executive Officer John Surma said the deal, announced late on Sunday, will make US Steel the world's 
fifth-largest steelmaker. 
He added that the deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, would not preclude US Steel from making further 
acquisitions. In June, the company completed the $2.1 billion acquisition of tubular steelmaker Lone Star 
Technologies. ``I don't think we're going to put up the stop sign -- this is a very dynamic industry,'' he told Wall 
Street analysts on a conference call on Monday. 
Stelco emerged from bankruptcy protection last year and put itself up for sale in June after a wave of foreign 
takeovers in the industry. 
Pittsburgh-based US Steel, which itself was a subject of takeover talk this year before giant German industrial 
conglomerate ThyssenKrupp denied an approach, said it would buy Stelco for C$38.50 per share, a 43 percent 
premium over the company's closing stock price of C$26.93 on Friday. 
US Steel would also pay down the majority of Hamilton, Ontario-based Stelco's debt, which was about $760 
million as of June 30, according to a joint statement late on Sunday night. 
The companies said shareholders owning more than 76 percent of Stelco's shares have agreed to support the 
deal. 
During the conference call, Surma said that in addition to the shareholder support, the steelworkers' unions also 
backed the deal. ``I can say the steelworkers approve of our transaction and support it. It's full steam ahead.'' 
The companies did not say what role Stelco CEO Rodney Mott would play after the acquisition and Surma said 
only: ``He can speak for himself.'' When called by Reuters, Mott's office said he was tied up with meetings. 
Surma said that the US company would acquire Stelco's Lake Erie Works in Nanticoke, Ontario, which produces 
some 2.9 million tons per year, and the Hamilton Works, which produces around 2.6 million tons of steel slabs, or 
large blocks of semifinished steel. ``This is a very important strategic transaction as it enhances our position in 
flat-rolled manufacture. ``This brings us to 33 million plus tons, of which about 25 million tons are in North 
America, making us the fifth-largest steelmaker in the world,'' said Surma. 
A company spokesman said ArcelorMittal, Nippon Steel Corp, Tata Steel and JFE Holdings make more steel. 
Most of US Steel's steelmaking capacity is flat-rolled steel, used in the manufacture of automobiles, airplanes and 
appliances. Asked whether US Steel would sell off any assets, such as Stelco's bar-making capacity, Surma said 
it was too early to say. 
Stelco's slab production of approximately 900,000 tons per year would fit nicely with US Steel, which has excess 
capacity at its rolling mills. ``If North American flat-rolled demand continues to gain, then the overall position of 
those who have slab capacity will be substantially enhanced.''

Page 16 of 48 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
US Steel projects the deal will bring annualized pretax synergies of more than $100 million by the end of 2008. 
The transaction should boost earnings per share in 2008, excluding synergies and the impact of purchase 
accounting adjustments. 
US Steel would guarantee pension funding obligations under an agreement between Stelco and the province of 
Ontario and would also make a voluntary contribution of approximately $31 million to Stelco's main pension 
plans. 
Analysts have said Stelco's stock could be overvalued if the company's underfunded pension and other 
obligations were taken into account. That bill totaled C$1.7 billion in December, though it has likely declined by as 
much as C$300 million since then as interest rates have risen, Scotia Capital's David Tyerman estimated last 
month. 
Credit Suisse analyst David Gagliano said the deal would be ``a logical acquisition ... given Stelco's production 
mix and physical proximity to US Steel's Midwestern US operating base.'' 
But 23 times projected 2008 earnings ``is a fairly steep price to pay, and we suspect it was the price required to 
get 76 percent of Stelco's shareholders on board.'' 
Analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research said Stelco's earnings have been depressed as they rebuilt some 
facilities and expanded others. ``I think the earnings are likely to be a lot higher in coming quarters than they were 
last quarter.'' 
US Steel shares were up 39 cents at $93.78 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Stelco shares 
were up C$10.72 at C$37.65 in Toronto. ($1$1.05 Canadian) (Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Steve

Shareholders owning more than 76 percent of Stelco's outstanding shares, including Tricap Management Ltd., 
Sunrise Partners LP, Appaloosa Management LP and Rodney Mott, the CEO of Stelco, have committed to 
supporting the transaction. 
U.S. Steel said it will pay for the acquisition and retire the majority of Stelco's existing debt through a combination 
of cash on hand, existing financing facilities and proceeds under two new senior credit facilities, which total $900 
million and were underwritten by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Scotia Capital. 
U.S. Steel expects the deal will save more than $100 million by the end of 2008, and add to 2008 earnings per

The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, subject to review by regulators.

NEW YORK, TORONTO -- Shortly before 5 p.m. Sunday, John Surma could feel things slipping away. 
His company, Pittsburgh-based United States Steel Corp., had recently submitted an offer for Stelco Inc., 
Canada's last remaining independent steel company, in an attempt to consolidate its grip on the North American 
market and keep pace with larger foreign rivals. 
Only now, there was a problem. Stelco's chief executive officer, Rodney Mott, was phoning to tell him that 
Russian steel giant OAO Severstal had just lobbed in a higher offer, and the company was leaning toward 
accepting it, according to people familiar with the matter. 
A short while later, Mr. Mott phoned again with a proposition: Stelco, which wanted to bring its auction to a 
conclusion before yesterday morning, would invite both companies to table their best and final bids by 9 that 
night. After huddling with his advisers, and discussing the matter for several hours with unions and the 
government of Ontario, Mr. Surma took one last shot: a $1.1-billion (U.S.) offer that would vault U.S. Steel up a 
notch to become the world's fifth-largest steel maker. 
A half hour later, he received a congratulatory phone call telling him he had won. 
For Mr. Surma, the acquisition boosts his company's steel production by 5.5 million tons to 33 million tons: Huge 
by North American standards, but still less than a third of the annual output of Dutch producer ArcelorMittal. 
The global industry has undergone significant consolidation in the past few years, as deep-pocketed suitors from 
India, Russia and Germany have looked to take advantage of rising steel prices and increasing demand from 
developing countries such as China. The whirlwind of takeover activity has claimed all of Canada's steel 
producers, including Dofasco , Algoma , and most recently, Ipsco , each of which was sold to a foreign acquirer. 
“Last-minute auctions in the steel industry [are] getting fairly common now,” said one person who works on these 
deals. “It's cheaper to buy than it is to build.” 
Mr. Surma estimated yesterday that the Stelco purchase would result in annual cost savings of $100-million, and 
that the company's leading-edge Lake Erie operation would strengthen U.S. Steel's position in the lucrative 
flat-rolled steel market. Flat-rolled steel is used in the manufacturing of automobiles, appliances, and office 
furniture. 
Yet some analysts suggested that U.S. Steel's recent buying spree might also be motivated by a desire to thwart 
an unwelcome takeover approach. This spring, the company paid $2.1-billion to acquire Lone Star Technologies, 
a Dallas-based steel maker. U.S. Steel has also expanded into Europe, and boasts steel mills in Slovakia and 
Serbia. 
“Although the deal is a strategic fit for [U.S. Steel], the company's recent bolt-on strategy seems more of a 
defensive play,” Brian Niemiec, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group, said in a research note yesterday. 
He said the company was rumoured this year to be a target. 
That might have seemed unthinkable a decade ago, but given the emergence of powerful players like 
ArcelorMittal, itself the product of a pending merger between the top two industry players, analysts say no steel 
producer is immune to consolidation.

In a conference call with analysts yesterday, Mr. Surma said the Stelco deal would not preclude further 
acquisitions. 
The company has a healthy balance sheet, and has promised to inject $100-million into Stelco's Hamilton plant. It 
said it has no plans to reduce the company's roster of 3,600 employees, and pledged to retire $760-million of 
Stelco debt. The deal is expected to close before the end of the year. 
U.S. Steel, Severstal, Algoma and others considered bidding for Stelco when the company was in creditor 
protection, but the advances were rebuffed. Since the Canadian company emerged from creditor protection last 
year with Mr. Mott at the helm, it has sold assets and trimmed jobs in Hamilton. 
David MacGregor, an analyst with Longbow Research in Cleveland, said the deal appears to be a good fit. And 
although U.S. Steel is widely viewed as a consolidator rather than a target, Mr. MacGregor said its purchase of 
Stelco could make it more appealing to hungry suitors. “They'd make a great acquisition now,” he said. “With one 
transaction, [a buyer] could be one of the leaders in the North American market. In this day and age, you just can't 
rule that out.”

Stelco agrees to Dollars 1.1bn US Steel takeover.

Stelco, Canada's last domestically controlled steelmaker, has agreed to a USDollars 1.1bn cash bid by 
Pittsburgh-based US Steel, continuing a flurry of consolidation in the global steel industry. 
The deal will boost US Steel's raw steel capacity by 5.5m tons a year to about 33m tons. 
While the combined group will be less than a third the size of ArcelorMittal, the global industry leader, the move 
could help dampspeculation that the Pittsburgh group was vulnerable to a predator. The acquisition is sure to fan 
debate in Canada about the "hollowing out" of domestic industry. 
Four other Canadian steel groups - Dofasco, Ipsco, Algoma Steel and Harris Steel - have fallen into foreign hands 
over the past two years. 
But Jim Forbes, head of PwC's global metals practice, said: "It's much better to have a foreign-controlled 
company that's buying value assets than an independent playing in a field of global, integrated players." 
Mr Forbes added:"If you're an orphan steel plant making three, four or five million tons, it's very difficult to operate 
in isolation." 
Stelco's jewel is its Lake Erie works, which is the most modern integrated steel plant on the continent but 
currently has excess slab capacity. 
John Surma, US Steel's chief executive, said it would convert 900,000 tons of that slab into higher margin 
finished products. US Steel foresees the acquisition producing annual pre-tax cost savings of more than Dollars 
100m by the end of 2008. 
Mr Forbes predicted that Stelco's facilities would become more specialised. "They may not stay in all the product 
lines they're in." 
Mr Surma said the deal would also expand US Steel's customer base. Its exposure to the automotive industry will 
grow from 18 per cent to 22 per cent of total shipments. 
Stelco, based in Hamilton, south-west of Toronto, put itself up for sale this year after emerging from a lengthy 
court-supervised restructuring. 
Rodney Mott, chief executive, said: "Our goal was to re-establish Stelco as a competitive steel company and 
position it to be part of a larger, stronger company that can provide additional security for our employees and their 
communities." 
US Steel has offered CDollars 38.50 for each Stelco share, a 43 per cent premium over Friday's closing price. 
Owners of more than 76 per cent of Stelco shares have backed the transaction, US Steel said. US Steel shares 
were little changed in early trading yesterday.

By Laura Mandaro 
SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones) -- United States Steel Corp.'s latest acquisition, a $1 billion deal to buy Canada's 
Stelco Inc., shows merger interest in the metals sector has yet to be extinguished by volatile credit markets. 
Late Sunday, U.S. Steel Corp. (X) said it would acquire Stelcofor C$38.50 a share, or C$1.1 billion. The buyout 
price works out to the equivalent of $36.56 a share, or a 43% premium over Hamilton, Ontario-based Stelco's 
Friday close of C$26.93 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
Shares of U.S. Steel closed down 0.4% in New York trading Monday, while Stelco shot up 39.7% in Toronto. 
U.S. Steel said the purchase would strengthen its position as a supplier of flat-rolled steel products to a slow but 
steadily growing North American market. The Pittsburgh-based company is gaining two major steel plants that 
together churn out 6.6 million tons of raw steel a year, lifting its capacity to 33 million tons of raw steel. U.S. Steel 
plans to use Stelco's steel slabs in its own plants, where it will turn the raw metal into higher margin, 
manufactured products. 
"We're optimistic about the long-term steel environment in North America," said U.S. Steel CEO John Surma in a 
conference call Monday. 
One analyst also interpreted U.S. Steel's acquisition strategy as part of a broader effort to bulk up to forestall any 
potential takeover bid. 
"Although the deal is a strategic fit for [ U.S. Steel], the company's recent bolt-on strategy seems more of a 
defensive play at this stage," wrote Brian Niemiec, Susquehanna Financial Group commodities analyst, in a 
morning note. 
"The company may be trying to ward off any unwanted approaches," he added. 
Stelco, for its part, made clear in June that it was for sale, a strategic decision following its emergence from 
bankruptcy in 2006. 
The deals come as private-equity players and bankers forecast that the pace of large acquisitions, particularly 
leveraged buyouts, will ebb as borrowing becomes more expensive. But strategic deals, at least on a smaller 
scale, have continued. 
In fact, U.S. Steel said Monday that it had lined up loans to fund the Stelco acquisition that carry rates similar to 
those on the credit facilities it arranged with a previous purchase, the $2.1 billion June buyout of steel-pipe maker 
Lone Star Technologies (LSS) . U.S. Steel is paying about 62.5 basis points over the London Interbank Offered 
Price on the Lone Star facilities, said U.S. Steel CFO Gretchen Haggerty. 
Along these lines, No. 2 U.S. steel producer Nucor Corp. (NUE) said Monday that it's completed the previously 
disclosed acquisition of Magnatrax, a provider of custom-engineered metal building systems for the North 
American non-residential construction market, for $280 million in cash. 
Shares of Nucor closed down nearly 3% at $53.47 Monday. 
Holders of more than 76% of Stelco -- including Chief Executive Rodney Mott as well as Appaloosa Management 
and two other investment firms -- have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the U.S. Steel deal, the companies 
said in a statement.

Page 26 of 48 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Terms also call for Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel to assume Stelco's $730 million of net debt at June 30. The 
company said it would fund the deal and retire Stelco's debt using a combination of cash on hand, current credit 
lines and $900 million of new senior credit lines underwritten by J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Scotia Capital. 
U.S. Steel sees the deal generating more than $100 million of pre-tax synergies by the end of next year and 
contributing to earnings on an adjusted basis for 2008. 
The deal, which the companies hope to close this year, is subject to antitrust review in the U.S. and Canada. J.P. 
Morgan advised U.S. Steel, while CIBC and UBS advised Stelco. 
CEOs and deals 
Just six weeks ago, the chief executives of two major steelmakers -- U.S. Steel's own John Surma and Lakshmi 
Mittal of Arcelor Mittal (MT) -- told the Associated Press that they saw more consolidation ahead, particularly 
across continents and within China's fragmented and fast-growing industry. 
In 2006, Arcelor bought Mittal Steel, creating the No. 1 global steelmaker. That deal still is under regulatory 
review. 
On Sunday, the U.K. Telegraph reported that China may bar Arcelor Mittal from bidding for a stake in steelmaker 
Laiwu. Arcelor is already part owner of Hunan Valin Steel Tube & Wire, and the report said the country was 
uneasy about having both stakes in one company's hands. 
Other deals were announced by Tata Steel (TATLY) of India, Evrazof Russia and Nucor Corp. (NUE) , based in 
Charlotte, N.C. 
In Australia, OneSteelclosed a deal for Smorgon Steel, andJapan's Mitsuibought Steel Technologies (STTX) . 
And on Aug. 22, Canada's Gerdau (GNA) received U.S. antitrust clearance to acquire Chaparral Steel (CHAPV) . 
Stelco had reviewed alternatives 
On June 1, Stelco said that with help from CIBC and UBS, it had begun a review of strategic alternatives, "in light 
of the ongoing consolidation in the steel industry." 
In July, Stelco reported a second-quarter net loss that widened to C$41 million from C$39 million in the first 
quarter, as sales rose 18% to C$717 million. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 
sharply on a quarter-to-quarter basis. 
As part of the deal, U. S. Steel said it has made commitments to Ontario regarding Stelco's main pension plans 
and operations in Canada's most populous province. 
Specifically, U. S. Steel plans "significant" capital spending at Stelco's Hamilton and Lake Erie facilities. 
U.S. Steel is guaranteeing Stelco's pension-funding obligations under a 2006 agreement between Stelco and the 
province. The acquiring company will also make a voluntary contribution of $31 million to Stelco's main pension 
plans when the deal closes. [ 08-27-07 2202ET ]

PITTSBURGH (AP) - United States Steel Corp. is buying Canadian steel maker Stelco Inc. for about $1.1 billion 
(euro810 million) in a move expected to bolster its position as a supplier to the North American automotive 
industry. 
The Pittsburgh-based company said the cash deal will increase its production capacity to about 33 million net 
tons of raw steel annually, up from its current yearly capacity of 26.8 million tons, making it the world's fifth-largest 
steel maker. 
Steel slabs produced at Stelco's Lake Erie and Hamilton plants will be sent to U.S. Steel facilities that finish 
flat-rolled steel -- used in the auto and appliance industries -- and tubular steel used mostly in the energy sector, 
the company said. 
Stelco emerged from bankruptcy protection last year and announced plans to cut 15 percent of its work force 
after settling a new four-year contract with the United Steelworkers union. 
John Surma, U.S. Steel's chairman and chief executive, said the planned acquisition was important strategically. 
"We have some optimism about the long-term outlook for North American steel," he said in a conference call with 
analysts and reporters Monday. "(Stelco) fits nicely into our Midwestern consumption patterns." 
Surma said Stelco's management team had done an "excellent job" of restructuring the company, partly through 
facility shutdowns, and that it could become a "very high-performing" part of U.S. Steel's business. 
Rodney Mott, Stelco's president and chief executive, said in a statement that the goal of the restructuring was "to 
re-establish Stelco as a competitive steel company and position it to be part of a larger, stronger company that 
can provide additional security for our employees and their communities." 
U.S. Steel said it plans major capital improvements at Stelco's Hamilton and Lake Erie plants. It is also 
guaranteeing Stelco's pension funding obligations under an agreement reached last year with the province of 
Ontario. U.S. Steel also will make a voluntary contribution of $31 million (euro22.7 million) to Stelco's main 
worker pension plan. 
Global steel makers have been consolidating in recent years to deal with intense competition, the need to reinvest 
in aging mills and new opportunities in Asia. 
Earlier this year, U.S. Steel completed a $2 billion (euro1.46 billion) deal to acquire Texas-based Lone Star 
Technologies Inc., which makes welded pipe used in oil fields. 
Charles Bradford, an industry analyst with Bradford Research/Soliel Securities in New York, said U.S. Steel's 
acquisition of Stelco would improve its position in the automotive sector. 
He noted that the automotive industry accounted for the largest portion -- 38 percent -- of Stelco's business, and 
that the combination would raise U.S. Steel's automotive industry shipments from 18 percent to 22 percent of total 
business. It will also expand U.S. Steel's customer base in the construction industry. 
It is also a good fit geographically, he said, pointing to the close proximity of Stelco's Lake Erie plant -- the most 
modern integrated steel plant in North America -- to a U.S. Steel facility in the Detroit area.

U.S. Steel said the deal would strengthen its position as a supplier of flat-rolled steel products to the North 
American market. 
Under terms of the deal, U.S. Steel will pay 38.50 Canadian dollars ($36.73) per share for Stelco's 30 million 
shares outstanding. As of June 30, Stelco had about $760 million (euro556.45 million) of net debt on its balance 
sheet. 
Shareholders owning more than 76 percent of Stelco's outstanding shares, including Tricap Management Ltd., 
Sunrise Partners LP, Appaloosa Management LP and Rodney Mott, the CEO of Stelco, have committed to 
supporting the transaction. 
U.S. Steel said it will pay for the acquisition and retire the majority of Stelco's existing debt through a combination 
of cash on hand, existing financing facilities and proceeds under two new senior credit facilities, which total $900 
million (euro658.95 million) and were underwritten by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Scotia Capital. 
U.S. Steel expects the deal will save more than $100 million (euro73.22 million) by the end of 2008 and add to 
2008 earnings per share, excluding the impact of purchase accounting adjustments. 
The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, subject to review by U.S. and Canadian regulators. 
Shares of U.S. Steel fell 38 cents to $93.01 (euro68.1) Monday.

NEW YORK/TORONTO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - U.S. Steel Corp agreed to acquire Stelco Inc for $1.1 billion, bagging 
the last big Canadian-owned steelmaker and strengthening its position in flat-rolled steel products in North 
America. 
Chief Executive Officer John Surma said the deal, announced late on Sunday, will make U.S. Steel the world's 
fifth-largest steelmaker. 
He added that the deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, would not preclude U.S. Steel from making further 
acquisitions. In June, the company completed the $2.1 billion acquisition of tubular steelmaker Lone Star 
Technologies. 
"I don't think we're going to put up the stop sign -- this is a very dynamic industry," he told Wall Street analysts on 
a conference call on Monday. 
Stelco emerged from bankruptcy protection last year and put itself up for sale in June after a wave of foreign 
takeovers in the industry. 
Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, which itself was a subject of takeover talk this year before giant German industrial 
conglomerate ThyssenKrupp denied an approach, said it would buy Stelco for C$38.50 per share, a 43 percent 
premium over the company's closing stock price of C$26.93 on Friday. 
U.S. Steel would also pay down the majority of Hamilton, Ontario-based Stelco's debt, which was about $760 
million as of June 30, according to a joint statement late on Sunday night. 
The companies said shareholders owning more than 76 percent of Stelco's shares have agreed to support the 
deal. 
During the conference call, Surma said that in addition to the shareholder support, the steelworkers' unions also 
backed the deal. "I can say the steelworkers approve of our transaction and support it. It's full steam ahead." 
The companies did not say what role Stelco CEO Rodney Mott would play after the acquisition and Surma said 
only: "He can speak for himself." When called by Reuters, Mott's office said he was tied up with meetings. 
Surma said that the U.S. company would acquire Stelco's Lake Erie Works in Nanticoke, Ontario, which 
produces some 2.9 million tons per year, and the Hamilton Works, which produces around 2.6 million tons of steel 
slabs, or large blocks of semifinished steel. 
"This is a very important strategic transaction as it enhances our position in flat-rolled manufacture. 
"This brings us to 33 million plus tons, of which about 25 million tons are in North America, making us the 
fifth-largest steelmaker in the world," said Surma. 
A company spokesman said ArcelorMittal , Nippon Steel Corp , Tata Steel and JFE Holdings make more steel.

Most of U.S. Steel's steelmaking capacity is flat-rolled steel, used in the manufacture of automobiles, airplanes 
and appliances. Asked whether U.S. Steel would sell off any assets, such as Stelco's bar-making capacity, 
Surma said it was too early to say. 
Stelco's slab production of approximately 900,000 tons per year would fit nicely with U.S. Steel, which has 
excess capacity at its rolling mills. "If North American flat-rolled demand continues to gain, then the overall 
position of those who have slab capacity will be substantially enhanced." 
U.S. Steel projects the deal will bring annualized pretax synergies of more than $100 million by the end of 2008. 
The transaction should boost earnings per share in 2008, excluding synergies and the impact of purchase 
accounting adjustments. 
U.S. Steel would guarantee pension funding obligations under an agreement between Stelco and the province of 
Ontario and would also make a voluntary contribution of approximately $31 million to Stelco's main pension 
plans. 
Analysts have said Stelco's stock could be overvalued if the company's underfunded pension and other 
obligations were taken into account. That bill totaled C$1.7 billion in December, though it has likely declined by as 
much as C$300 million since then as interest rates have risen, Scotia Capital's David Tyerman estimated last 
month. 
Credit Suisse analyst David Gagliano said the deal would be "a logical acquisition ... given Stelco's production 
mix and physical proximity to U.S. Steel's Midwestern U.S. operating base." 
But 23 times projected 2008 earnings "is a fairly steep price to pay, and we suspect it was the price required to 
get 76 percent of Stelco's shareholders on board." 
Analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research said Stelco's earnings have been depressed as they rebuilt some 
facilities and expanded others. "I think the earnings are likely to be a lot higher in coming quarters than they were 
last quarter." 
U.S. Steel shares were up 39 cents at $93.78 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Stelco shares 
were up C$10.72 at C$37.65 in Toronto. ($1=$1.05 Canadian) (Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and

Stelco, Canada's last domestically controlled steelmaker, has agreed to a US$1.1bn cash bid by 
Pittsburgh-based US Steel, continuing a flurry of consolidation in the global steel industry. 
The deal will boost US Steel's raw steel capacity by 5.5m tons a year to about 33m tons. 
While the combined group will be less than a third the size of ArcelorMittal, the global industry leader, the move 
could help damp speculation that the Pittsburgh group was vulnerable to?a?predator.?The?acquisition is sure to 
fan debate in Canada about the "hollowing out" of domestic industry. 
Four other Canadian steel groups - Dofasco, Ipsco, Algoma Steel and Harris Steel - have fallen into foreign hands 
over the past two years. 
But Jim Forbes, head of PwC's global metals practice, said: "It's much better to have a foreign-controlled 
company that's buying value assets than an independent playing in a field of global, integrated players." 
Mr Forbes added:"If you're an orphan steel plant making three, four or five million tons, it's very difficult to operate 
in isolation." 
Stelco's jewel is its Lake Erie works, which is the most modern integrated steel plant on the continent but 
currently has excess slab capacity. 
John Surma, US Steel's chief executive, said it would convert 900,000 tons of that slab into higher margin 
finished products. US Steel foresees the acquisition producing annual pre-tax cost savings of more than $100m? 
by ?the end of ?2008. 
Mr Forbes predicted that Stelco's facilities would become more specialised. "They may not stay in all the product 
lines they're in." 
Mr Surma said the deal would also expand US Steel's customer base. Its exposure to the automotive industry will 
grow from 18 per cent to 22 per cent of total shipments. 
Stelco, based in Hamilton, south-west of Toronto, put itself up for sale this year after emerging from a lengthy 
court-supervised restructuring. 
Rodney Mott, chief executive, said: "Our goal was to re-establish Stelco as a competitive steel company and 
position it to be part of a larger, stronger company that can provide additional security for our employees and their 
communities." 
US Steel has offered C$38.50 for each Stelco share, a 43 per cent premium over Friday's closing price. 
Owners of more than 76 per cent of Stelco shares have backed the transaction, US Steel said. US Steel shares 
were little changed in early trading on Monday.

By Laura Mandaro 
United States Steel Corp.'s (X) latest acquisition, a $1.1 billion deal to buy Canada's Stelco Inc. (STE.T), shows 
merger interest in the metals sector has yet to be extinguished by volatile credit markets. 
Late Sunday, U.S. Steel Corp. said it's acquiring Stelco for C$38.50 a share. The buyout price works out to the 
equivalent of $36.56 a share, or a 43% premium over Hamilton, Ontario-based Stelco's Friday close of C$26.93 
on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
Shares of U.S. Steel rose 0.6% to $93.94 in New York trading, while Stelco shot up 40% to C$37.74 in Toronto. 
U.S. Steel said the purchase would strengthen its position as a supplier of flat-rolled steel products to the North 
American market. 
One analyst interpreted U.S. Steel's acquisition strategy as part of a broader effort to bulk up as a means of 
forestalling any potential takeover bid. 
"Although the deal is a strategic fit for [ U.S. Steel], the company's recent bolt-on strategy seems more of a 
defensive play at this stage," wrote Brian Niemiec, Susquehanna Financial Group commodities analyst, in a 
morning note. 
"The company may be trying to ward off any unwanted approaches," he added. 
Stelco, for its part, made clear in June that it was for sale, a strategic decision following its emergence from 
bankruptcy in 2006. 
The deals come as private-equity players and bankers forecast that the pace of large acquisitions, particularly 
leveraged buyouts, will ebb as borrowing becomes more expensive. But strategic deals, at least on a smaller 
scale, have continued. 
Along these lines, No. 2 U.S. steel producer Nucor Corp. (NUE) said Monday it's completed the previously 
disclosed acquisition of Magnatrax, a provider of custom-engineered metal building systems for the North 
American non-residential construction market, for $280 million. 
Shares of Nucor slipped 0.2% to $54.99. 
Holders of more than 76% of Stelco - including Chief Executive Rodney Mott as well as Appaloosa Management 
and two other investment firms - have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the U.S. Steel deal, the companies 
said in a statement. 
Terms also call for Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel to assume Stelco's $730 million of net debt at June 30. U.S. Steel 
said it would fund the deal and retire Stelco's debt using a combination of cash on hand, current credit lines and 
$900 million of new senior credit lines underwritten by J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Scotia Capital. 
U.S. Steel expects the deal to generate more than $100 million of pre-tax synergies by the end of next year and 
contributing to earnings on an adjusted basis for 2008.

Page 37 of 48 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The deal, which the companies hope to close this year, is subject to antitrust review in the U.S. and Canada. J.P. 
Morgan advised U.S. Steel, while CIBC and UBS advised Stelco. 
CEOs And Deals 
Just six weeks ago, the chief executives of two major steelmakers - U.S. Steel's own John Surma and Lakshmi 
Mittal of Arcelor Mittal (MT) - told the Associated Press that they saw more consolidation ahead, particularly 
across continents and within China's fragmented and fast-growing industry. 
In 2006, Arcelor bought Mittal Steel, creating the No. 1 global steelmaker. That deal still is under regulatory 
review. 
On Sunday, the U.K. Telegraph reported that China may bar Arcelor Mittal from bidding for a stake in steelmaker 
Laiwu Steel Corp. (600102.SH). Arcelor is already part owner of Hunan Valin Steel Tube & Wire Co. (000932.SZ), 
and the report said the country was uneasy about having both stakes in one company's hands. 
Other deals were announced by Tata Steel Ltd. (500470.BY) of India, Evrazof Russia and Nucor, based in 
Charlotte. 
More recently, in June, U.S. Steel itself closed the purchase of Lone Star Technologies, a producer of oil-field 
pipe and tubing. 
In Australia, OneSteel Ltd. (OST.AU) closed a deal for Smorgon Steel, and Japan's Mitsui & Co. Ltd. (MITSY) 
bought Steel Technologies Inc. (STTX). 
And on Aug. 22, Canada's Gerdau Ameristeel Corp.(GNA) received U.S. antitrust clearance to acquire Chaparral 
Steel Co. (CHAP). 
Stelco Had Reviewed Alternatives 
On June 1, Stelco said that with help from CIBC and UBS, it had begun a review of strategic alternatives, "in light 
of the ongoing consolidation in the steel industry." 
In July, Stelco reported a second-quarter net loss that widened to C$41 million from C$39 million in the first 
quarter, as sales rose 18% to C$717 million. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 
sharply on a quarter-to-quarter basis. 
As part of the deal, U. S. Steel said it made commitments to Ontario regarding Stelco's main pension plans and 
operations in Canada's most populous province. 
Specifically, U. S. Steel plans "significant" capital spending at Stelco's Hamilton and Lake Erie facilities. 
U.S. Steel is guaranteeing Stelco's pension-funding obligations under a 2006 agreement between Stelco and the 
province. The Pittsburgh steelmaker also will make a voluntary contribution of $31 million to Stelco's main 
pension plans when the deal closes.

PITTSBURGH (AP) - United States Steel Corp. is buying the Canadian steel maker Stelco Inc. for about $1.1 
billion in a move expected to bolster its position as a supplier to the North American automotive industry. 
The Pittsburgh-based company said slabs produced at Stelco's Lake Erie and Hamilton plants will supply 
finishing facilities for flat-rolled steel -- used in the auto and appliance industries -- and tubular steel used mostly 
in the energy sector. 
After the acquisition, U.S. Steel will become the world's fifth-largest steel maker. It will have with a production 
capacity of about 33 million net tons of raw steel annually, up from its current yearly capacity of 26.8 million tons. 
Stelco emerged from bankruptcy protection last year and announced plans to cut 15 percent of its work force 
after settling a new four-year contract with the United Steelworkers union. 
John Surma, U.S. Steel's chairman and chief executive, said Stelco was an important strategic acquisition that 
would increase U.S. Steel's ability to respond to market demands and customer needs. 
"We have some optimism about the long-term outlook for North American steel," he said in a conference call with 
analysts and reporters Monday. "(Stelco) fits nicely into our Midwestern consumption patterns." 
Surma said Stelco's management team had done an "excellent job" of restructuring the company, partly through 
facility shutdowns, and that it could become a "very high-performing" part of U.S. Steel's business. 
Global steel makers have been consolidating in recent years to deal with intense competition, the need for major 
reinvestment in aging mills and new opportunities in Asia. 
Earlier this year, U.S. Steel bought Texas-based Lone Star Technologies Inc., which makes welded pipe used in 
oil fields, for $2 billion. 
Charles Bradford, an industry analyst with Bradford Research/Soliel Securities in New York, said U.S. Steel's 
acquisition of Stelco would strengthen its position in the automotive sector. 
He noted that the automotive industry accounted for the largest portion -- 38 percent -- of Stelco's business, and 
that the combination would raise U.S. Steel's automotive industry shipments from 18 percent to 22 percent of total 
business. 
It's also a good fit geographically, he added, pointing to the close proximity of Stelco's Lake Erie plant to a U.S. 
Steel facility in the Detroit area. 
Under terms of the deal, U.S. Steel will pay 38.50 Canadian dollars ($36.73) per share for Stelco's 30 million 
shares outstanding. As of June 30, Stelco had about $760 million of net debt on its balance sheet. 
Shareholders owning more than 76 percent of Stelco's outstanding shares, including Tricap Management Ltd., 
Sunrise Partners LP, Appaloosa Management LP and Rodney Mott, the CEO of Stelco, have committed to 
supporting the transaction.

Page 39 of 48 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
U.S. Steel said it will pay for the acquisition and retire the majority of Stelco's existing debt through a combination 
of cash on hand, existing financing facilities and proceeds under two new senior credit facilities, which total $900 
million and were underwritten by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Scotia Capital. 
U.S. Steel expects the deal will save more than $100 million by the end of 2008 and add to 2008 earnings per 
share, excluding the impact of purchase accounting adjustments. 
The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, subject to review by U.S. and Canadian regulators. 
Shares of U.S. Steel fell 38 cents to $93.01 Monday.

Under terms of the deal, U.S. Steel will pay Canadian $38.50 ($36.73) per share for Stelco's 30 million shares 
outstanding. As of June 30, Stelco had about $760 million of net debt on its balance sheet. 
Shareholders owning more than 76 percent of Stelco's outstanding shares, including Tricap Management Ltd., 
Sunrise Partners LP, Appaloosa Management LP and Rodney Mott, the CEO of Stelco, have committed to 
supporting the transaction.

U.S. Steel said it will pay for the acquisition and retire the majority of Stelco's existing debt through a combination 
of cash on hand, existing financing facilities and proceeds under two new senior credit facilities, which total $900 
million and were underwritten by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Scotia Capital. 
U.S. Steel expects the deal will save more than $100 million by the end of 2008, and add to 2008 earnings per 
share, excluding the impact of purchase accounting adjustments. 
The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, subject to review by U.S. and Canadian regulators. 
Shares of U.S. Steel fell 38 cents to $93.01 Monday.

PITTSBURGH -- U.S. Steel Corp. (X) Chief Executive John Surma, during the company's fourth-quarter earnings 
conference call on Tuesday, said his company remains open to making acquisitions with some of the $1.03 billion 
cash on its balance sheet as of Dec. 31. 
"It's very possible. I think our priorities are the same," said Mr. Surma. 
He said the company is still interested in assets being privatized in Turkey and the Ukraine as well as assets in 
North America, such as Stelco Inc. in Hamilton, Ontario. 
He said he is also open to equity participation in obtaining coal or iron ore assets in eastern Europe to provide 
raw materials for the company's steelmaking operations in Serbia and Slovakia. 
"We are ready, willing and able to participate," Mr. Surma said. "It just has to be on the right terms."
