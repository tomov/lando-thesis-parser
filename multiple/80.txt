Acquisition-Prone Oracle Likened To "Big Pirate Ship'

In the wake of his hostile takeover of PeopleSoft, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison is often compared to a pirate captain. 
Perhaps Ellison's well-known love of sailing has something to do with it. 
Shai Agassi, an executive board member at SAP, got into the act Wednesday, tarring his business software 
nemesis with the pirate paintbrush. Speaking at a meeting of the Churchill Club in Silicon Valley, Agassi likened 
Oracle to a group of bandits patrolling the high seas. "There are pirates in the water," he said. 
Oracle's core business -- database software -- has slowed in recent years. To keep growing, the company has 
pushed deeper into business applications -- SAP's main focus. Over the past year, Oracle has spent billions to 
acquire application software firms, including PeopleSoft, Retek, I-flex Solutions and Siebel Systems. 
Agassi on Wednesday made light of Oracle's drive to consolidate the industry. 
"There's a big pirate ship going around," he said. "If you're not fast enough, they take your stuff and put you on 
their boat." 
The discussion also touched on a recent management shake-up at Oracle. 
Greg Maffei, Oracle's former chief financial officer, stepped down on Nov. 3 after just four months on the job. 
Some analysts say he was drawn into a behind-the-scenes power struggle with Oracle co-President Safra Catz, 
who took over as chief financial officer. On Wednesday, Maffei said he would take the CEO job at Liberty Media. 
When asked about this melodrama, Agassi resumed his pirate analogy: "Some people have to walk the plank."

Mergers & Acquisitions: The Dealmakers Journal

The late summer and early fall of 2005 will go down in the history of the software industry as a time when 
everything seemed to be in alignment to create a frenzy of deals. Software experts note the industry's growing 
division between the haves and the have-nots. Out of the group of deals, the still evolving industry is continuing to 
produce its own class of blue-chip companies. 
"Right now, the Big 5 or 6 software companies account for over half the revenue," says M.R. Rangaswami, a 
Principal at Sand Hill Group, provider of investments and management advice to emerging enterprise technology 
firms. He puts SAP AG, Oracle Corp., Symantec Corp., EMC Corp., and Microsoft Corp. in this group along with 
Siebel Systems Inc., which Oracle is acquiring for $5.9 billion. 
Rangaswami adds that despite this concentration and more consolidation on the way, the largest players can't 
supply all the technology needed. Therefore, he foresees the survival of a set of smaller companies that will 
provide focused solutions for the information technology (IT) market. 
What is driving the consolidation wave and what are the principal aims of the deals being done? It may not be a 
perfect storm, but a number of factors have combined to spur increased dealmaking. 
"This wave of M&A is occurring because it's gotten harder for software companies to make money," says Erik 
Keller, a Principal at Wapiti LLC, a consulting firm focused on enterprise technology. Ken Bender, President of 
Software Equity Group in San Diego, says that with IT budgets at businesses growing at a mere 2.6%, buyers are 
being driven to acquire because they need top-line growth. 
Both software companies and corporate IT departments cut expenses to survive the years of the industry's 
downturn that followed the Nasdaq crash in April 2000. "When you have all the expenses taken out, you have 
look for increased revenues," Bender says. This means companies are eyeing targets that offer significant 
revenue growth potential. 
Also contributing to the healthy deals environment is that stock market valuations for most software companies 
have been steady or declining, making this an inexpensive time to be shopping. Add in a restricted IPO window 
for most companies and the stricter accounting and corporate governance standards created by Sarbanes-Oxley 
and you round out the list of forces that have made it tough for software companies to survive. 
"It used to be you could hit $40 million and do an IPO, but now compliance costs and other market conditions 
make it hard to survive, much less go public if you are under $100 million," Keller says. 
The key buyer in the latest string of software deals is Oracle. Its acquisition of Siebel in September followed its 
$10.3 billion purchase of PeopleSoft Inc. and its $670 million Retek Inc. buy, in which Oracle outbid SAP. Both 
Oracle and SAP make enterprise resource planning (ERP) software that runs management information systems 
associated with the operations or production aspects of a company. 
The existence of 400 ERP companies 10 years ago, compared with the current 20 players, is one gauge of the 
extent of software sector consolidation. 
In the PeopleSoft deal, Oracle also got enterprise software provider J.D. Edwards & Co., which was being bought 
by PeopleSoft. Not only is Oracle closing deals at a fast rate but it overcame an antitrust challenge by the federal 
government to buy PeopleSoft. With its 2005 acquisitions, Oracle bypassed SAP to become the second-largest 
software company.

Other big software deals this year include the $3.4 billion purchase of Macromedia Inc. by Adobe Systems Inc., 
Sun Microsystems Inc.'s $4.1 billion purchase of Storage Technology Corp., and Symantec Corp.'s $10.5 billion 
acquisition of Veritas Corp. 
Another notable deal this year was the acquisition of SunGard Data Systems Inc., a leader in financial software, 
by a consortium of private equity firms led by Silver Lake Partners for $11.4 billion in cash. 
In an example of a mid-market transaction, ERP player Lawson Software Inc. bought Swedish Intentia 
International AB for $480 million. Among smaller software companies, SSA Global Technologies Inc., which 
provides supply chain software, is a key example of an enterprise software consolidator. In an adjacent sector, 
eBay Inc. agreed to buy Skype Technologies SA, the world's largest provider of VoIP services, for $2.6 billion plus 
potential considerations that could raise the price to $4.1 billion. 
Oracle CEO Larry Ellison's take on the future of the industry has been a vision to which other enterprise software 
players have had to react. His prediction of a software industry future in which there are only a handful of 
companies has been hotly debated. In one interview he predicted that the survivors would be SAP, Oracle, 
Microsoft, and International Business Machines Corp. 
Although Microsoft has made its own bunch of acquisitions, including Great Plains, Axapta, Navision, and 
Solomon, it hasn't been as prominent a buyer in the deals wave in the second half of 2005. Much of this year's 
software M&A activity has been in business-to-business applications, a sector where Microsoft isn't a major 
player. 
Oracle's dealmaking has been designed to make it a legitimate applications company, fighting against SAP for 
control of enterprise software business. But not surprisingly, a number of software industry experts don't share 
Ellison's view about a future with only a small number of software firms. 
"The industry will always be able to sustain 150 or 200 sizeable companies and it will never get to the four or five 
that Larry is predicting," says Vinnie Mirchandani, Co-Founding Partner of SourcingWorld Partners, a technology 
management consultancy. 
But even if the enterprise software world doesn't shrink as much as Ellison forecasts, there is no shortage of 
speculation about the motives behind his acquisition strategy. 
Marc Hebert, an Executive Vice President of Sierra Atlantic, a Fremont, Calif.-based enterprise systems 
integrator, says he sees Ellison's strategy as being based on a belief that ERP software is entering the mature 
end of a product life cycle. His deals are designed to make sure that Oracle is a survivor. 
Mirchandani analyzes Ellison's strategy as an effort to buy mature software companies that offer high-margin 
maintenance streams. But he adds that in many cases, companies' chief information officers (CIOs) will see what 
Ellison is doing and will jump to other options rather than continue to pay license and maintenance fees to 
Oracle. 
One strategic question raised by Oracle's acquisitions is how many customers may defect to emerging business 
models. If CIOs and other corporate customers switch from Oracle and its newly acquired companies, it could 
undercut the rationale of the Oracle's acquisition plan. 
As for Oracle's major competitor, SAP, Keller says its response to Oracle's dealmaking need not be to make 
acquisitions itself but to take advantage of uncertainty among customers of Oracle and its recently acquired 
companies and to use that uncertainty to win accounts. 
One way to understand Oracle's recent acquisitions is that they point out a split in the software industry between 
competitors' styles of business. Oracle is based on the traditional model of selling licenses for a specific number 
of users and getting maintenance fees to ensure that the products continue to work. This is called the on-premise 
model. Oracle and all of its recent targets conform to this structure. The other key approach is "software as a 
service," which involves renting the product instead of selling it outright as on-premise producers do. Companies 
such as salesforce.com and Right Now Technologies Inc. have pioneered this approach. 
"On-demand is fundamentally better because it eliminates the ownership cost of using the software. It also 
delivers the benefits of the applications five times faster," says Greg Gianforte, founder and CEO of Right Now 
Technologies. Gianforte believes that on-demand will replace on-premise applications within a few years. He 
adds that it will be hard for on-premise suppliers like Oracle to shift to the on-demand model because to do so 
would cannibalize its primary business.

"You have a collision of business models and everyone is trying to enhance their model," Keller says. 
Another dynamic that's affecting the software industry is the increased use of "open source" software. With open 
source, the underlying programming code is available to the users so that they may read it, make changes to it, 
and build new versions of the software incorporating their changes. 
Companies such as Microsoft and Oracle, especially in its original database business, use proprietary models, 
which are under attack in some applications from open source. 
Indeed, another take on Ellison's acquisitions is that he's trying to stake out territory among users' IT systems in 
which his products are safe from the commoditization that comes with customers switching to open-source 
products. 
Other threats to the on-premise players may arise from business process outsourcing (BPO), offshore vendors, 
and third-party maintenance vendors. Yet another option Mirchandani points out is the "build it yourself" strategy, 
which can be cost-efficient by using offshore development teams. 
One way the collision of business models has played out is that companies have tried to roll up players using the 
same model, which is Ellison's strategy. There has been less consolidation around the "software as a service" 
model, but that is because it is a younger and smaller industry. In the mid-market, SSA Global has been on a 
buying spree to enhance its offering in the supply chain management and customer relationship markets. 
The dynamics for mid-market software deals are different from the strategies and drivers of larger deals. 
Bart Hughes, a Managing Partner at Accenture, notes that it's hard for a software company with revenues less 
than $100 million to survive. Small software vendors are facing a difficult situation with widespread 
commoditization of products threatening them from below and larger vendors invading their space from above, he 
adds. 
Bender says that valuations for mid-market software companies are all over the map. "Valuations differ widely 
from sector to sector and depend not only on the size of the target but also on the size of the buyer," he says. 
Valuations given to an ERP, a supply chain vendor, or a customer relationship management (CRM) company like 
Siebel can be misleading if the metrics are applied to the mid-market, where multiples are often much lower. 
Bender notes that for the smaller public companies and some private ones, there are fewer buyers, and less 
chance that micro and mid-size firms will get the valuations they want. 
Smaller software companies looking to be acquired should understand their niches, states Nat Burgess, a Senior 
Vice President at Corum Group. A lot of companies, he says, overestimate their position in the value chain, which 
leads them to expect over-optimistic prices if they sell. He adds that smaller players may try to choose between 
traditional on-premise business models and newer structures, such as "software as a service," but has found that 
hybrid models often work best for mid-size players. 
Another software industry expert, Howard Anderson, a professor at MIT's Sloan Business School, counsels 
mid-size software companies to determine whether they are strategic or tactical suppliers to their customers. 
Anderson notes that strategic suppliers, such as Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and Cisco, sell products that form the 
bases of IT operations at major corporations. Software vendors that offer ancillary products are the tactical 
suppliers. 
"Every vendor would like to be a strategic supplier, but you have to earn it," he says, noting that customers will 
look first to strategic suppliers to fulfill a need. 
He says that much of the recent M&A activity in the sector is driven by the need for strategic suppliers to be able 
to offer new services to customers within their product line. Anderson adds that add-on acquisitions of tactical 
products need not be best of breed but they do have to integrate well with the strategic suppliers' other products. 
Burgess points out that financial services is a hot deals market for mid-size software companies because the 
buyers have continued to be early adopters and big spenders. As an example, he cites recent deal activity in the 
market for mortgage loan portfolio analysis companies, because of the likelihood that rising interest rates will 
boost defaults. Other sectors where Burgess expects to see continued deal activity are peer-to-peer and social 
networking companies, mobile and wireless technology providers, content companies, and software companies 
that assist in the alignment of business goals and IT infrastructure. He says that security software is still an active 
sector but is too picked-over by venture capitalists at this point to produce deals with attractive prices.

Another theme in the mid-market software sector, according to Mirchandani, is that when Oracle is willing to pay a 
multiple that's three to six times revenue, it muddies the waters for smaller software companies that might be in 
play. "They think they should get two to four times revenues because of what's going on further up the food 
chain," Mirchandani says. 
Another force underlying the flood of software deals is the desire of customers to buy from fewer suppliers. 
Anderson says some IT shops will have as many as 100 suppliers. As a result, industry consolidation offers to 
reduce the choice and complexity of the CIO's list of licenses. This creates a disincentive for young companies 
because some potential buyers don't want to add another niche supplier. However, there is some pushback on 
this approach because of fears that if a company's list of suppliers shrinks far enough, its IT functions could be 
held hostage to the desires of a single supplier. 
Anderson says that some customers responded to the aggressive rollup strategy of Computer Associates 
International Inc. by inserting a clause in their contract with independent software vendors that if the supplier is 
bought by Computer Associates, all contracts are cancelled. They took this action because of Computer 
Associates' reputation for cutting service while hiking license fees as they consolidated segments of the industry. 
Despite this type of concern from some customers, the ongoing consolidation of the industry is moving toward 
fewer suppliers. 
"The industry has voted in favor of the single provider approach," Herbert says. 
In the face of these structural changes and the ongoing consolidation plays by large software vendors, 
dealmakers might assume that deal flow won't be robust in the sector. 
Gianforte, an advocate of "software as a service," says he expects to see further consolidation of the on-premise 
software vendors because "their existing core business will go away." But with more than 2,000 companies, 
experts say the overall consolidation wave is likely to continue. 
Rangaswami says he thinks the industry is only in the middle of what will be a 12-to-18-month cycle of 
consolidation. He also expects to see more venture capitalists getting taken out by private equity buyers as 
occurred in the acquisition of Red Prairie Corp., a provider of supply chain execution applications, by Francisco 
Partners. 
Mirchandani notes that there are hundreds of applications that the giant software vendors don't touch. He points 
to a number of vertical industries such as utilities, telecommunications, and health care on which the recent deal 
wave will have no impact. He also suggests that rather than look for home runs in term of multiples, sellers of 
software companies would do better to take a more realistic approach and accept lower valuations. 
Hebert, taking a broad view, says that while the software sector is going through a sobering period for investors, it 
has produced a number of blue-chip firms that will continue to grow and post stable earnings.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Larry Ellison says his goal is to build Oracle from a $15-billion (U.S.) company to $30-billion 
over the next few years, while maintaining 40-per-cent operating margins. 
“There will have to be a couple of acquisitions along the way,” the chief executive officer of Oracle Corp. said in 
an interview at OpenWorld, the company's annual conference held recently in San Francisco. 
But with a string of acquisitions already under Oracle's belt in its bid to compete more effectively with Microsoft 
Corp. and SAP Corp. in the enterprise software market, some customers of the companies that have been bought 
are wondering where Mr. Ellison's plans leave them. 
Over the past year alone, Oracle acquired PeopleSoft for $10.3-billion and announced its intention to buy Siebel 
Systems for $5.8-billion. Smaller acquisitions include Retek, Oblix, TimesTen, Context Media and G-Log. 
Mr. Ellison has promised lifetime support for acquired product lines in order to calm customer fears that they'd be 
forced to upgrade to different software. 
Despite this, some customers remain concerned, because Oracle also plans to merge the “best of breed” 
products from these acquisitions into one applications suite, called Fusion, by 2008. 
“It's very confusing for customers to really find out what's going on,” said Wynne Powell, president of London 
Drugs, a Canadian retail chain that has a significant investment in PeopleSoft products. “I think they [Oracle] 
themselves truly haven't nailed down all the details.” 
Fusion is still a concept, he said, and uncertainty about what the final product will look like doesn't result in happy 
customers — particularly when they've invested millions in IT systems whose future is in question. 
Even minor upgrades to these systems can result in huge costs for an organization, Mr. Powell said. 
His company uses customer relationship management (CRM) software from PeopleSoft. He wants to know what's 
going to happen to development of the PeopleSoft product should the Siebel acquisition go through as planned, 
because Oracle says it is buying Siebel for its CRM technology and its base of 4,000 customers. 
“We've expended millions of dollars on these systems and we can't afford — especially in the Canadian market — 
to tear up those scarce dollars,” Mr. Powell said. 
The city of Oshawa, Ont., runs its financial and human resource applications on PeopleSoft. Dave Mawby, 
manager of applications support for the city, said he's waiting until Fusion comes out before making any decisions 
about its IT systems. “It's hard to say what you're going to do at this point. We're kind of reconstituting ourselves 
now under the Oracle umbrella.” 
The problem for these customers is that the next-generation Fusion suite won't see the light of day until at least 
2008, said Jim Shepherd, senior vice-president at AMR Research. “And I think that's optimistic.” 
Instead of trying to cobble together existing products, Oracle wants to build a next-generation system that 
incorporates the features of the software it has acquired, but not necessarily the original code — and that takes

time. While it's a mammoth task, Mr. Shepherd said, it's a workable approach. “Combining all of those products 
into one in the sense of merging their code would have not been feasible.” 
The company's first task is to figure out what features to build around. Oracle already has several CRM products, 
for example, so from a technology perspective it doesn't really need Siebel — although it wants Siebel's market 
share. 
“Oracle was not doing very well in the CRM market,” Mr. Shepherd said, but by buying Siebel, “they do gain a 
great deal in terms of their credibility as a CRM provider.” 
In taking this portfolio-building approach to growth, Oracle is saying it will work with customers to maintain their 
current environments, and will migrate them over time to Fusion as it evolves, said Joel Martin, an analyst at IDC 
Canada. But supporting all those products also means hefty costs. 
“If they're truly committed to supporting these applications for a ‘lifetime,' they can do it,” he said. “But how long 
are they willing to sacrifice margins because of the increased costs of supporting all those different customers?” 
Meanwhile, Microsoft and SAP are both working on major enhancements to their software for the 2007 time 
frame, Mr. Martin said. Both are aggressively pursuing the small and mid-size business market where most of the 
growth opportunities lie, and any uncertainty around Oracle could drive business their way. 
Oracle's biggest challenge right now is its head-to-head battle with SAP in applications, Mr. Shepherd said. 
Despite the headaches that adding products to its portfolio may cause, it means Oracle will likely continue to 
acquire players in vertical markets where SAP is less dominant, to build market share. 
“They have bought an awful lot of companies in a relatively short time,” Mr. Shepherd said. “And even though 
they're a very large company, that does generate a lot of distraction and disorganization . . . particularly in the 
sales organization.” 
And at the end of the day, London Drugs' Mr. Powell said, Oracle's growth still depends on sales and cash flow, 
and customers making large investments in IT want to feel confident about the direction of the technology they're 
buying. “They're going to find there's people like SAP nipping at their heels.”

- Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle Corporation, has not yet sated his appetite despite consuming PeopleSoft last 
year. With i-flex, TimesTen and Retek already acquired this year, Oracle has now agreed a price for Siebel 
Systems, previously noted as an alternative to PeopleSoft. If Mr Ellison is working down the hit list he presented 
to the board in 2003, BEA Systems, Business Objects or Sybase could be next. 
- Rijkman Groenink, ABN AMRO chairman, finally has something to smile about, after the ABN-BPI-Antonveneta 
takeover triangle that was Europe's banking drama of the summer. BPI's board has given its approval for the sale 
of its 29.4% stake in Italian Antonveneta to the Dutch bank at E26.5 per share. BPI should not be too unhappy 
either - it will bring home about E2.2bn, representing a capital gain of E150m-E200m.

Tech giant plans more purchases, but there is concern that this strategy will not win more customers, writes Karlin 
Lillington in San Francisco 
Larry Ellison's new mantra? "Supersize me." The Oracle Corporation founder and chief executive told reporters 
after his keynote audience at Oracle's annual Open World trade show last week that the acquisition-hungry 
company - 10 companies in the past 10 months, including big ticket items PeopleSoft and Siebel - should double 
in value to around $30 billion (€24.9 billion) in a few years, and more acquisitions are on the cards. 
"In order to grow at this pace, there'll have to be a couple of acquisitions along the way," Ellison said. "The tricky 
thing is to grow at this rate and to maintain a 40 per cent operating margin." 
It was clear from the show, however, that many customers and partners are wonderingwhether Oracle is putting 
on fat or muscle, and whether all that bulk will make it a fit powerhouse or an obese has-been. 
Questions about the acquisition strategy were at the top of the agenda for participants who put questions to 
Ellison during his keynote speech - open mike questions have become a trademark part of his keynotes. 
They also peppered Oracle president Charles Phillips with queries during a hastily-organised round table session 
on the Siebel acquisition. 
The company's strategy also came under fire this week from analysts when Oracle's sales results came in below 
analysts' predictions and, in some areas, as much as 25 per cent below the company's own estimates as well. 
This spurred concern on Wall Street that the company's acquisitions, totalling $19 billion this year, were not 
translating into new customers. 
The shortfalls caused share prices to tumble to lows not seen in three years, although Ellison said that database 
profits were in line with Oracle's strategy of steady 10 per cent growth per annum over 10 years. 
In particular, sales of business management applications, while up 84 per cent overall at $127 million, were off 
analysts' predictions of $150 million, a rise expected following the acquisitions of PeopleSoft and Retek, which 
specialise in this type of software. 
But Oracle insisted that it was notsuffering from acquisition indigestion. "The transaction is digestible and 
integratable," Gregory Maffei, Oracle's chief financial officer, said this week. 
Currently worth $14.5 billion, Oracle paid $10.3 billion for PeopleSoft, while the Siebel deal, if approved by 
regulators, will ring up at $5.8 billion. 
The company will not be looking for further large companies, said Ellison, and Oracle's one time interest in 
middleware company BEA had now waned. However, following the acrimonious purchase of PeopleSoft, he 
repeatedly said that Oracle would have no interest in other large companies, only to go on to bid for Siebel less 
than a year later. 
Oracle will continue to make "niche" purchases to flesh out its offerings into areas like hosted services and 
customer relationship management (CRM), both Phillips and Ellison said. The company announced one such 
purchase - of G-Log, a Pennsylvania-based maker of logistics and transportation management software - in the 
middle of Open World.

Page 14 of 165 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Siebel - founded by ex-Oracle employee Tom Siebel - was purchased primarily for its strength in the CRM space, 
Phillips said. The acquisition will enable Oracle to go after Siebel competitor Salesforce.com, another company 
founded by an ex-Oracle employee, Marc Benioff. 
"We want to go after Salesforce.com as much as we can," Ellison said during his press conference. "I'm an 
investor in Salesforce, and I want to see my investment go to zero." 
He told his keynote audience that he believed many strong Oracle competitors would emerge in coming years, in 
addition to key rival SAP. "The application space is going to be diverse and complex five years from now, and it's 
not going to simply be Oracle versus SAP," he said. 
Among them, he counted Salesforce.com, Microsoft, Netsuite, ADP and Infosys. 
Phillips said that absorbing longtime rivals PeopleSoft and Siebel would not be difficult as there weren't major 
differences in the corporate cultures or the knowledge sets of the three companies. 
"A substantial number of those people used to work for Oracle," Phillips said. 
Merging the three companies constituted "a reunion and isn't as difficult as it may look from the outside". 
Tom Siebel, who regularly exchanged snide potshots with Ellison in past years, would have "an ongoing role for 
some time to come" at Oracle, said Phillips. Major job cuts were not expected, either. 
The PeopleSoft and Siebel brand names had value in the market and would continue to be used, he said, part of 
an Oracle attempt to calm customer fears that they will be pushed into using Oracle products over time. 
Oracle will also expand its offerings to the small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a huge, if narrow profit 
market that it has only begun to tap into recently with trimmed down versions of its database products. The SME 
market "has been abandoned by a lot of our competitors. We see it as a big opportunity," said Phillips. 
Asked why database manufacturer Oracle has been busy acquiring applications companies, Ellison told 
journalists: "The applications business is enormously profitable; the growth rates are higher than the database 
business. We make most of our money in licence renewals. It's the largest and most profitable part of our 
business. Two-thirds of it is in middleware and databases, and one-third is in applications. It's a story that we 
haven't done a very good job telling." 
Ellison's keynote stressed the need for increased database security, as companies perform more transactions 
and information exchanges over the web, and switch to using voice over internet protocol (VoIP) phone networks, 
where voice and data calls are digitised over the same system. 
Data backups should also be encrypted, he said. 
As usual, the trade show featured keynotes by other big name chief executives, including Sun's Scott McNealy, 
who fired off one-liners at his friend Ellison's expense, HP chief executive Mark Hurd, who in a fairly bland 
keynote, announced new partnerships with Oracle, and Intel boss Paul Ottelini, who said that new chip designs 
and manufacturing processes would transform the data handling abilities of computers, while lowering energy 
consumption.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Oracle Corp. CEO Larry Ellison said Wednesday the business software maker 
probably won't make another major acquisition for at least another year to give the company ample time to 
assemble all the pieces snapped up during a recent $18 billion shopping spree. 
After that respite, Oracle will return to the takeover trail to realize Ellison's long-term goal of more than doubling 
the company's annual revenue to $30 billion, the CEO told reporters. 
"I don't think that's an unreasonable target," Ellison said, if Oracle grows "through a combination of acquisitions 
and organic growth." 
Wednesday's media session, following a speech at Oracle's annual trade show, marked the first time Ellison has 
met with reporters since announcing plans last week to buy a longtime rival, Siebel Systems Inc., for $5.85 billion. 
That proposed marriage followed Oracle's $11.1 billion takeover late last year of another fierce competitor, 
PeopleSoft Inc. In other acquisitions completed this year, Oracle has bought Retek Inc. for $665 million and an 
assortment of smaller software makers for undisclosed amounts. 
Although he refused to identify other takeover targets remaining on his wish list, Ellison revealed that he is no 
longer interested in buying BEA Systems Inc., a San Jose-based business software maker with just over $1 billion 
in annual sales and a market value of about $3.5 billion. 
"BEA was very high on our list, but they are less interesting to us than they used to be," Ellison said. 
Ellison engineered Oracle's expansion to increase its market share in business applications software -- products 
that automate a wide range of administrative tasks. A dominant force in database software for the past two 
decades, Redwood Shores-based Oracle now wants to supplant Germany's SAP AG as the world's largest maker 
of business applications software. 
Although SAP and Oracle appear well entrenched as the industry leaders, Ellison expects both companies to 
face stiffer competition. 
"I think the applications space will be diverse and complex five years from now," Ellison said during his speech. 
He predicted Microsoft Corp. and two rapidly growing online software makers, Salesforce.com Inc. and NetSuite 
Inc., are poised to become "serious players." 
Ellison made his remarks about the industry's competitive landscape as Oracle gears up for an antitrust review of 
its Siebel deal. The company needs regulators in both the United States and Europe to conclude the takeover 
wouldn't diminish competition to ensure the acquisition is completed in early 2006. 
The U.S. Justice Department tried to block last year's PeopleSoft takeover, but lost the battle in a monthlong trial 
after Oracle persuaded a federal judge that it would continue to face robust competition from many rivals, 
including Microsoft and Siebel. 
Most industry analysts think it's unlikely U.S. regulators will challenge the Siebel deal, given Oracle's antitrust 
victory last year. Oracle executives, though, have predicted regulators will take a hard look at the deal before 
ultimately approving the transaction.

SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones)--With its $5.85 billion merger with Siebel Systems Inc. (SEBL) pending, Oracle 
Corp. (ORCL) is not presently planning another large acquisition, Chief Executive Larry Ellison said Wednesday. 
Speaking at the Oracle OpenWorld conference for software developers, Ellison said, "obviously, there are a 
number of areas that interest" Oracle. 
However, "we really don't have another large acquisition in mind right now," he added during a 
question-and-answer session following a keynote address. "This visionary is living very much in the present." 
Ellison said Oracle is focused on building its next generation of products: the Fusion middleware and 
applications. 
Earlier this year, Oracle purchased rival PeopleSoft Inc. and the smaller software maker Retek Inc. (RETK). 
Ellison said the company is less interested in an acquisition of BEA Systems Inc. (BEAS) than it was in the past. 
"At one time, BEA was quite attractive to us," he said. "I think we are less interested than we used to be." 
Ellison said Oracle's application server has made up ground on BEA's. "We know we have more users," he said. 
In addition, BEA has a poison pill takeover defense and would fight an unfriendly acquisition attempt, Ellison 
added. 
In contrast, Ellison said Oracle would consider an acquisition of an analytics software company or even a 
security software company. Oracle expects to grow its analytics business through internal growth and a potential 
purchase, but a merger is not necessary, he said.

Page 21 of 165 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Security also is a major focus, including intrusion detection and identity management. However, Oracle is not 
interested in a company such as Symantec Corp. (SYMC) selling anti-virus software, he said. 
Ellison went on to say it is not a stretch to expect Oracle to be a $30 billion company in a few years. Through a 
combination of acquisitions and internal product growth, Oracle could reach that mark from just under $15 billion 
this year, he said. 
"I don't think that is an unreasonable target," Ellison said. 
The company also should be quite profitable. Oracle is running its PeopleSoft acquisition at 40% operating 
margins and should be able to run Siebel, when it closes early next year, at the same margin, he said. 
Ellison said he hopes to retain most of the Siebel engineering staff and sales force. The company plans to create 
a separate sales force for customer-relationship-management software. 
"We didn't acquire the company to lay all the people off," he said. 
The Siebel acquisition also won't slow down Oracle's development of Fusion, its next generation product line. 
With the addition of the Siebel developers, Oracle should be able to do a better job of building Fusion, he said. 
Ellison went on to say the software applications market should look quite a bit different in five years. "I think the 
applications space is going to be diverse and complex five years from now," he said. Outsourcing companies, 
firms delivering software as a service over the Internet and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) should be serious 
competitors, he said. 
In response to questions, Ellison said he personally has bought two restaurants and five adjoining lots in Malibu. 
He said he plans to build a series of small beach cottages on the lots.

Oracle, with its acquisitions of PeopleSoft, Retek, and Siebel Systems, is shaping up into a company with a full 
suite of competitive applications and a challenger to SAP, the leading applications vendor. 
But without this buying spree, Oracle applications would have played second fiddle to other vendors in the 
marketplace, said Ray Lane, former president of Oracle and now a venture capitalist. While president of Oracle, 
Lane's candidate for leading the enterprise applications market would have been a combined PeopleSoft and 
Siebel. The two companies talked about merging in the late 1990s, at a time when Oracle was struggling to win 
broader acceptance of its applications, Lane said. 
Lane, a general partner with the venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, commented on the 
application marketplace in wide-ranging remarks during a dinner in San Francisco on Tuesday while the Oracle 
OpenWorld conference was under way elsewhere in the city. His main focus was one of Kleiner Perkins' 
investments, Virsa Systems Inc., a real-time compliance software startup. 
Both Siebel and PeopleSoft had excellent domain knowledge in their chosen specialties and good sales staffs, 
Lane said. If they had merged, Siebel, as a leader in customer-relationship-management software, and 
PeopleSoft, a leader in human-resources management applications, would have made a strong applications 
contender to Oracle and SAP. 
"Craig Conway and Tom Siebel talked but couldn't figure out how to get together. Now Larry is doing it for them," 
Lane said. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison completed the purchase of PeopleSoft in January and is in the process of 
acquiring Siebel for $5.85 billion. 
"The reason Oracle is buying Siebel is because it was losing in CRM applications," Lane said. Now it has a 
chance to take Siebel and PeopleSoft's market leadership and make a run at SAP's dominance in applications, 
he said. 
Douglas Laird, senior VP at Virsa Systems, said he worked at PeopleSoft in the late 1990s at the time talks were 
going on between Siebel founder Tom Siebel and Dave Duffield, PeopleSoft's founder and chairman.

ORACLE CORP. Chief Executive Larry Ellison is aggressively buying software companies. Will rival International 
Business Machines Corp., the industry's self-styled neutral party, lose the competition? 
That question is raised again by Oracle's agreement last week to purchase Siebel Systems Inc., an ally to IBM in 
its sales of database and other software. Siebel is the fourth such major partner in the past two years to be 
bought by Oracle. 
Oracle and IBM are fierce competitors in the market for heavy-duty business database software, and both lean on 
application vendors, like Siebel, to help drive sales. (In the software industry, applications -- programs that work 
with data -- are generally separate from databases, which store data.) The application vendors are critical to 
database-system providers because most customers first select a particular application -- say, Siebel's 
customer-relationship-management software -- then go shopping for a database system to put beneath it. IBM 
quit the application business more than a decade ago and steadfastly has refused to get back in. 
Owning application makers has advantages: In 2000, IBM forged an alliance with retail-software vendor Retek 
Inc., predicting the partnership would generate $1 billion in joint sales within three years. Earlier this year, Oracle 
bought Retek. It quickly formed a "Retail Global Business Unit" to sell "solutions" based on Retek's applications 
and, of course, its own database, potentially undermining IBM's alliance. 
Two recent market-research studies offer differing pictures of the database-systems industry, but both show 
Oracle gaining strength on IBM. IDC puts Oracle on top of the relational database-systems market, with a 41.1% 
share to IBM's 29.5% in 2004, a gap that has widened from prior years. Gartner Inc. uses different methodology 
and has IBM ahead by a hair, 34.3% to 33.9%. But two years prior, IBM led by more than two percentage points 
in the Gartner study. 
The Siebel deal is "not good news for IBM," said Judith Hurwitz, a consultant at Hurwitz & Associates whose 
clients have included IBM and Oracle. "If Oracle is able to go and buy up the best partners you have, you have to 
have a strategy that protects you." 
IBM's strategy has two prongs: First, serve as a neutral third party that customers of its giant services arm can 
trust to recommend applications without home-team bias. Second, strike partnerships with applications vendors 
that help IBM sell not only database software but also "middleware" -- other products that link systems together -- 
plus services and computer hardware. 
"You need what IBM delivers to complete the solution," said Steve Mills, IBM's software chief. "Nothing stands 
alone in this world." 
At least some executives inside IBM were questioning that strategy as recently as 2003, when Oracle announced 
a hostile bid -- ultimately successful -- for PeopleSoft Inc., another major application vendor. 
Internal IBM documents introduced at an antitrust trial included a presentation on the effect of the 
Oracle-PeopleSoft combination that labeled a "successful Oracle bid" as "negative for IBM," because of "possible 
impact on strong PeopleSoft and [J.D. Edwards] alliance revenue." (At the time, PeopleSoft was in the process of 
acquiring application vendor J.D. Edwards; when Oracle won PeopleSoft, it got both.)

One bullet point: taking "blocking stakes in key [software vendors]."

Mr. Mills declined to discuss the content of the documents, other than to say that they were "not a reflection" of 
IBM's thinking, and that IBM's present strategy will continue. "We think our strategy is responsive to where 
customers want to go," he said. IBM's software unit alone had sales of $15.1 billion in 2004, more than Oracle's 
total sales. Software represents about 16% of IBM's total revenue but about a third of its operating profit. Software 
sales have grown about 7% a year since 2002, slightly slower than IBM's overall growth rate. 
After the PeopleSoft deal, IBM chief Samuel J. Palmisano said he knew questions were being asked about his 
strategy, and he presented it to IBM's board for reaffirmation. Directors concurred that IBM was right to stay out of 
the application business. 
Siebel has long been allied with IBM. The two created "Siebel OnDemand," a combination of Siebel software and 
IBM database systems delivered over the Internet, a move meant to blunt Salesforce.com, Siebel's brash rival. 
Mr. Mills said he assumes an Oracle-owned Siebel will be "less favorable to IBM middleware." Indeed, Oracle's 
president said he sees an opportunity to gain "several hundred million in revenues" if Oracle can move Siebel's 
customers to its own database system. But Mr. Mills added that Oracle's voracious appetite may in the end help 
IBM, driving to it application vendors who might be reluctant to partner with a company that now owns its 
competition. 
Mr. Mills and other IBM executives also say the company has an edge on Oracle because it offers a wide array of 
hardware and services for the complex job of setting up a software system. Even Oracle sometimes needs to 
partner with IBM, since some of IBM's hardware only operates with its own database software. Indeed, Oracle 
and IBM are expected this week to announce that they will be jointly selling a J.D. Edwards application for those 
machines. 
IBM says its broad abilities help land customers like Information Resources Inc., a Chicago provider of market 
data to the retail industry. IRI is building a system that will offer predictive modeling, helping retailers and 
manufacturers forecast when shelves are likely to become empty. After evaluating Oracle and IBM, IRI chose IBM 
to provide the database system and middleware, said Romesh Wadhwani, IRI's chairman. 
Mr. Wadhwani said he was impressed with IBM's software and by the commitment of IBM's sales force to sell the 
system. He said he also uses Oracle products elsewhere in the company.

Siebel's hosted CRM business helped to make it an acquisition target for Larry Ellison's Oracle. But can the duo 
ever catch up with the market leaders? 
Some firms might be wary of investing in technology at the moment, but this certainly isn't true of IT vendors 
themselves. The recent rush of mergers and acquisitions continued last week with online auctioneer eBay 
announcing the purchase of VoIP specialist Skype for around$4bn; while Oracle continued its Pac-Man-like 
approach to the industry, swallowing up customer relationship management (CRM) firm Siebel. 
Oracle has been on a spending spree since the start of the year. No sooner had it succeeded in its long-fought 
bid for PeopleSoft than it was hunting for smaller vendors to snap up. Identity management software developer 
Oblix, real-time data management software firm TimesTen, and retail software providers Retek and ProfitLogic 
were all put in the shopping trolley, and Oracle took a controlling stake in India-based banking software company 
I-flex. 
And then when Oracle finished swallowing PeopleSoft/JD Edwards, it decided to make its move for Siebel. The 
purchase gives Oracle a new set of CRM applications to add to its ever-growing range. 
However, Siebel customers are likely to wonder for how long their existing implementations will be supported as 
standalone products, on non-Oracle databases, and whether they will be encouraged towards the integrated 
applications of Oracle's Project Fusion. 
And Oracle/PeopleSoft/JD Edwards users will have questions about the potential integration of Siebel's CRM 
systems into future products, and whether this will delay or further complicate the arrival of an integrated suite 
covering the now four sets of applications. 
Meanwhile, Oracle chief Larry Ellison sees potential for growth from the Siebel deal. According to Ellison, one of 
the main reasons for Oracle's interest in Siebel is Siebel's OnDemand hosted CRM business, which he predicted 
will expand rapidly. 
Ellison's view about the prospects for hosting is widely accepted across the industry. Recent figures from analyst 
firm AMR Research revealed that revenues from hosted CRM applications grew by 105 percent during 2004, and 
account for a tenth of the overall CRM market - which grew by 10 percent in comparison. 
But are Siebel's rivals offering more attractive propositions for hosted CRM? On the same day as the 
announcement of the Oracle/Siebel deal, hosted CRM pioneer Salesforce.com revealed details of AppExchange - 
an online site through which firms can buy and sell third-party applications and components to run on the 
company's platform. This should add to the attraction of Salesforce and means firms may be less tied to a single 
vendor that digs deeply into their enterprise systems. 
The question is, has Oracle been wise to bid $5.85bn for a company that has been lagging behind more 
established hosting firms such as Salesforce, and one that is a relatively small player in that market at present, 
rather than going after a better established hosting firm, which would come with a lower price tag? 
Siebel's customer base of around 4,000 firms with 3.4 million users is an obvious attraction. But for how long can 
the annual maintenance/support/upgrade software model sustain itself in a market where customers increasingly 
want hosted services and flexibility?

Oracle to Pay $5.85 Billion For Siebel

Oracle to Pay $5.85 Billion For Siebel

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 12 -- Oracle, the giant database-software maker, announced on Monday that it would 
pay $5.85 billion to acquire Siebel Systems, its largest competitor in the market for sales automation programs. 
The deal will bolster Oracle's effort to topple its German rival SAP as the leading seller of business applications 
software for big corporations. 
It comes less than a year after Oracle managed to achieve a hostile takeover of PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion after 
a contentious battle that dragged on for nearly 18 months. 
Oracle says its acquisition of Siebel will make it the largest seller of sales automation software -- a category also 
known as customer relationship management software. SAP remains a far bigger supplier of business 
applications over all, but the Siebel acquisition, said Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, ''moves us 
closer to our goal of being No. 1 in applications globally.'' 
While the Justice Department tried and failed to block the Oracle-PeopleSoft deal on the basis that it was 
anticompetitive, industry analysts and antitrust experts do not expect the Siebel deal to encounter the same 
regulatory opposition. 
The combined company will face considerable competition from SAP, as well as from Microsoft, I.B.M. and 
smaller rivals. And Oracle lawyers succeeded in the PeopleSoft case in convincing a judge that the enterprise 
software market was robust. 
Under the terms of the Oracle-Siebel combination, which is subject to the approval of shareholders of both 
companies, Oracle will pay $10.66 in cash or stock for each Siebel share. Siebel now has $2.24 billion in cash on 
hand, reducing Oracle's net takeover cost to $3.61 billion. 
The news was announced before the opening of the stock market on Monday. In trading, shares of Oracle rose 
21 cents, to $13.49. Siebel Systems advanced $1.16, or 12.7 percent, to $10.29 on volume of more than 187 
million shares -- roughly one in every three of its shares outstanding. 
Oracle agreed to exchange stock for up to 30 percent of Siebel. If the Oracle shares fall below $10.72 before the 
deal is completed, Siebel shareholders who choose stock will receive 0.994 share of Oracle for each share of 
Siebel stock. 
Oracle executives said the deal would add 2 cents to 3 cents a share to Oracle's profit in the 2007 fiscal year, 
ending in May 2007. The company said it expected to repurchase any shares issued in the acquisition. While 
Oracle expects to have $5 billion to $6 billion in cash at the time the deal is likely to close, it said it would use 
about $1.5 billion of its own cash and borrow the rest. 
Beyond PeopleSoft, Oracle has acquired several companies in the last year, including Retek, another business 
software producer, which it bought in March for $643 million. 
Mr. Ellison, speaking to analysts in a conference call on Monday, explained that Oracle had decided to wait for a 
few quarters after it integrated PeopleSoft before pursuing another large deal.

Page 28 of 165 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Once the Siebel acquisition is completed, most likely early in 2006, Oracle said it planned to promote Siebel's 
customer relationship management program over similar software developed by both Oracle and PeopleSoft. 
With Siebel, Oracle adds 4,000 customers, including some of the largest corporations, and roughly 3.4 million 
individual users. 
While Oracle's interest in Siebel had been known for some time, reaction was mixed on Wall Street. 
Charles Di Bona, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said he thought that the merger would be far more difficult 
than Oracle indicated, and that incorporating another major product line into Oracle's development process would 
be a great challenge. 
William Wall, a spokesman for SAP, said the deal would not cause SAP to change its strategy. ''We always 
anticipated that in order for Oracle to try to catch up with SAP, they would take this step,'' he said. ''We have the 
benefit of several years, and we intend to leverage that.'' 
But it may be Salesforce.com that has the most to gain -- or lose -- from the Oracle-Siebel merger. The company, 
whose chief executive, Marc Benioff, was a longtime associate of Mr. Ellison, has had considerable success 
providing customer relationship management software through an ''on demand'' subscription service rather than a 
discrete product, a strategy that many large customers have come to prefer. Siebel, in recent years, has begun 
moving toward a similar model, and analysts say that Oracle is trying to move in that direction with this merger. 
During Oracle's battle to acquire PeopleSoft last year, Mr. Ellison told a court that Siebel had long been on his 
company's short list of potential targets. 
Thomas M. Siebel, the chairman, had been an Oracle executive from 1984 to 1990. He founded Siebel in 1993. 
Since then, he and Mr. Ellison have sparred bitterly on occasion, but the relationship lacks the intense animosity 
that characterized Mr. Ellison's relationship with Craig A. Conway, the PeopleSoft chief executive, who 
unsuccessfully fought to prevent the takeover of his company. 
Siebel Systems has faced considerable turmoil in recent years; its revenue dropped to $1.3 billion last year from 
$2.1 billion in 2001. Mr. Siebel stepped down last year as chief executive and turned the job over to J. Mike 
Lawrie, a former I.B.M. executive. Siebel's board fired Mr. Lawrie in April after first-quarter results fell far short of 
expectations. George Shaheen, formerly of Webvan, took over as chief executive, but barely met revenue goals 
for the second quarter, and new license revenue was disappointing. 
Mr. Ellison and Mr. Siebel said Monday that the merger was driven primarily by customers' desire to do business 
with fewer suppliers, an idea that Mr. Ellison repeated throughout the battle for PeopleSoft. 
''What really moved these companies together,'' Mr. Siebel said, ''was a shift in market dynamics that has been 
occurring over the past three, four, five years.'' 
Where in past years, customers were satisfied to pick and choose the best applications from a variety of vendors, 
the complexity of business today has led them to want to simplify those relationships, he said. 
Siebel has about 5,000 employees at its headquarters in San Mateo, Calif., south of San Francisco, and 
throughout the world. While Mr. Ellison said that Oracle, based nearby in Redwood Shores, would retain Siebel's 
specialized sales force, analysts said that many Siebel employees were likely to be laid off as soon as the deal 
was completed. Oracle laid off nearly half of PeopleSoft's 11,000 employees soon after that deal took effect.

Oracle to Buy Siebel for $5.85 Billion --- Business-Software Industry Consolidates Still Further; Beefing

Oracle Corp. Chief Executive Larry Ellison extended his software consolidation strategy, reaching a 
long-anticipated deal with his former lieutenant and frequent sparring partner Thomas Siebel to acquire Siebel 
Systems Inc. for $5.85 billion in stock and cash. 
The deal, valued at about $3.61 billion after accounting for Siebel's holding of about $2.2 billion in cash, allows 
Oracle to absorb the 3.4 million users of Siebel's software for automating sales operations. Oracle has been using 
acquisitions to try to catch SAP AG of Germany, the leader in the market for business-software applications 
The strategy, honed with Oracle's PeopleSoft Inc. purchase earlier this year, is intended to add the existing 
business of a target company while broadening the customer base for Oracle's existing products. Oracle, though 
No. 3 behind Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machine Corp. in total software revenue, lags only SAP 
in business application programs. But with the addition of Siebel, Oracle now faces the challenge of integrating 
another large acquisition while it is still digesting PeopleSoft, which it acquired for $10.6 billion after a grueling, 
18-month takeover battle. Since then, Oracle has completed a half-dozen smaller acquisitions. 
Oracle will bear the cost of maintaining three product lines of so-called customer-relationship management 
software, as it continues to offer its own system and PeopleSoft's while adding Siebel's. It will also have the 
expense of a separate sales force for Siebel's product lines. Charles Phillips, one of three Oracle co-presidents, 
said recent changes to Siebel's sales structure had disrupted the company's business, but added, "We can fix 
that." 
Oracle predicted the deal will close early next year, after approval by Siebel shareholders. The acquisition is 
expected to face an antitrust review by the Justice Department, which unsuccessfully sought to block Oracle's 
purchase of PeopleSoft. 
Analysts said they don't expect strong opposition this time; Oracle has lagged well behind SAP and Siebel in 
CRM software, and Oracle's marketing of Siebel products could potentially increase competition in the market. 
Oracle executives, who are expected to aggressively cut costs at Siebel, said the deal will add two to three cents 
a share to Oracle's profits in fiscal year 2007, ending in May 2007, not including acquisition-related charges. 
Oracle plans to repurchase a number of shares equal to those issued in the acquisition, giving the effect of an 
all-cash deal for the company. Oracle said it will use about $1.5 billion of its own cash and will borrow the rest. 
Mr. Siebel's 10.6% ownership of Siebel's shares stands to earn him a payoff of about $585 million, not including 
his stock options. Earlier this year, Siebel sweetened the terms of its severance-payment agreements for key 
employees, with top executives eligible for up to 18 months pay and health coverage. 
The acquisition brings full circle the 23-year relationship between two of Silicon Valley's strongest personalities. 
Mr. Siebel was a top Oracle salesman before leaving the company under disputed circumstances in 1992. Since 
founding Siebel Systems in 1993, he has been an outspoken critic of his former boss, at times calling Mr. Ellison 
a "pathological" liar. 
For his part, Mr. Ellison in the past sought to hasten Siebel's demise, declaring in 2003 that "Siebel will vanish," 
and putting pressure on the smaller company by revealing he had held takeover talks with Mr. Siebel the previous 
year. In recounting those discussions, Mr. Siebel said he told Mr. Ellison, "Larry, you and I worked together for 
nine years, and that was enough," Information Week reported in 2004.

Page 30 of 165 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
By this year, Mr. Siebel had become a willing seller, and yesterday he called the combination "a wonderfully 
exciting event." Mr. Siebel, who built his company into one of technology's highest-fliers, watched its new 
software sales plummet in recent years as information-technology buyers grew wary of high-priced and 
complicated automation projects. 
Where customers once bought individual "best of breed" products for specific chores, Mr. Siebel said, those 
companies now want a single supplier to provide programs that work well together. Oracle has pledged to deliver 
an integrated suite of applications, dubbed "Project Fusion," starting in 2007. 
What brought Oracle and Siebel together "was a shift in market dynamics," Mr. Siebel told analysts. "The 
customer and partner community is communicating quite clearly and voting with their dollars that what they are 
looking for here is an integrated family of applications," he said. 
Even so, the on-again, off-again negotiations required a go-between -- Oracle's Mr. Phillips, who largely handled 
the talks with Mr. Siebel on Mr. Ellison's behalf. "Sometimes you do need an intermediary between two 
strong-willed people," Mr. Phillips said. 
Oracle agreed to pay $10.66 a share, a premium of roughly 17% to Siebel's closing price Friday of $9.13. Shares 
of Siebelrose more than 8% late last week as rumors spread that the two companies had been negotiating for 
weeks and that an agreement was imminent. Monday, Siebel's shares rose 13% or $1.16 to $10.29 in 4 p.m. 
Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. Oracle's shares rose 1.6% or 21 cents to $13.49, also on Nasdaq. 
The talks had gone cold last May, and then accelerated in the past month, Mr. Phillips said, after Oracle acquired 
control of Indian software company i-flex Solutions Ltd. As late as Sunday afternoon, the two sides had reached 
an impasse over the offer price. "We were one penny away and we almost came apart over one penny," Mr. 
Phillips said, declining to provide further details. "Every penny was negotiated." 
At Siebel's insistence, Oracle agreed to exchange stock for up to 30% of Siebel's shares. If Oracle's shares fall 
below $10.72 before the deal closes, Siebel shareholders that choose to receive stock will receive 0.994 shares 
of Oracle for each share of Siebel stock. 
SAP's chief executive, Henning Kagermann, played down the significance of the Oracle-Siebel combination. "We 
see no impact and no reason to react," he said. Mr. Kagermann predicted further industry consolidation, 
describing any deals SAP is likely to make as "targeted, fill-in acquisitions," with a price range in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars, rather than billions. 
For IBM, the Siebel deal raises concerns about the computer giant's partners falling under the control of a 
competitor. IBM and Oracle compete fiercely in database software. Siebel has worked closely with IBM, as did 
PeopleSoft and J.D. Edwards -- purchased by PeopleSoft -- and retail-software maker Retek Inc., purchased by 
Oracle. 
IBM said in a statement that its strategy is to be a "key partner" to thousands of software vendors. "We will 
continue to provide customers with IBM hardware, middleware and services for Siebel and other applications -- 
just as we continue to do so for PeopleSoft," the company said. 
Separately, Mr. Ellison has tentatively agreed to pay $100 million to charity over five years to settle private 
insider trading charges, according to a lawyer representing shareholders who were plaintiffs in the case. The 
shareholder derivative suit, filed in Superior Court in San Mateo, Calif., stemmed from Mr. Ellison's sales of stock 
in 2001 before news that Oracle would not meet financial targets, which caused its shares to decline. 
The settlement still must be approved by Oracle's board of directors and the court, said Joseph Tabacco Jr., an 
attorney with Berman DeValerio Pease Tabacco Burt &Pucillo representing plaintiffs in the case. In addition to the 
payment by Mr. Ellison to charities of his choosing, lawyers involved would receive up to $22.5 million, Mr. 
Tabacco said. The settlement was reported Monday by the New York Times. 
An Oracle spokeswoman declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Ellison couldn't immediately be reached.

Oracle To Buy Siebel In Its Latest Effort To Thin Out Industry; Merger Rumored For Months; The 
acquisition would give Oracle new weapons in its fight vs. SAP, Microsoft

Oracle on Monday confirmed a long-rumored deal to buy rival Siebel Systems as part of a broader strategy to 
consolidate the business software field. 
Few industry watchers seemed surprised by the $5.85 billion acquisition, which would price Siebel at $10.66 a 
share. Merger talks between the companies were first reported in the spring. 
Analysts expect the deal to strengthen Oracle's hand as it battles SAP and Microsoft for dominance in the 
business applications market. "From a strategic standpoint, this is very sensible for Oracle," said Drew Brosseau 
of SG Cowen & Co. "It adds more (product) depth and breadth." 
For years, Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison has insisted that the software market is ripe for a shakeout. 
Making good on that claim, Ellison has gone on a shopping spree so far this year. 
Oracle's acquisitions in 2005 have included: PeopleSoft, for human resources and finance software; Retek and 
ProfitLogic, for retail applications; and I-Flex, for outsourced software development. 
All the recent deals by Oracle have increased the risk of an integration failure, says David Hilal of Friedman 
Billings Ramsey. He rates Oracle stock as outperform, which equates to a buy. 
"The risk profile has gone up, but we believe the benefits still outweigh the negatives," Hilal said. 
In recent years, Siebel struggled to grow in the highly competitive market for customer relationship management 
software. Oracle's acquisition bid represents a 17% premium over Siebel's closing price of 9.13 on Friday. 
Subtracting Siebel's $2.2 billion in cash reserves, the net cost to Oracle would be $3.61 billion. 
Oracle would get more than 4,000 Siebel clients, pending approval of the deal. Siebel is known for making sales 
software that's tailored to unique industries, including energy, health care and insurance. 
In addition, Siebel would bring Oracle a growing line of business intelligence software. Clients use such programs 
to make sense of customer data. 
Siebel also has spent the past two years building up a new on-demand unit. That business was launched to 
compete with upstart vendors such as Salesforce.com that deliver software as needed over the Web. 
Oracle has not said how many of Siebel's 5,000 employees might be laid off. But most of the staff will likely be 
gone by year's end, predicts Richard Williams of Garban Institutional Equities. "They have avoided talking about 
that unpleasant reality," he said. "But that's where the savings will come from." 
Williams has a sell rating on Oracle stock. He's worried about the risks of combining so many diverse software 
programs. 
Oracle is racing to unify all its products on a single Web-based platform by 2008. That is roughly when SAP and 
Microsoft plan to unveil similar Web-based products. "Oracle is desperately scrambling to buy up companies and 
take on a mind-numbingly complex integration process," Williams said. "Such integration work is an enormous 
task."

Even so, many analysts doubt that Oracle's acquisition spree is over. 
Some say Oracle may want to pick up a supply chain management firm, such as i2 Technologies or Aspen 
Technology. Another target could be a business intelligence firm, such as Cognos or Business Objects. 
All the recent deals by Oracle may put SAP on the defensive, says Rebecca Wettemann of Nucleus Research. 
SAP lacks a foothold in the fast-growing on-demand market. So it may want to purchase a company such as 
Salesforce.com, Wettemann says. "Salesforce is challenged because Siebel now has an on-demand product in 
place with Larry Ellison's marketing machine behind it," she said. "SAP will have to work hard to differentiate 
itself." 
Oracle is now locked in a three-way horse race with SAP and Microsoft, says analyst Brosseau. He has a buy 
rating on Oracle stock. 
"Everybody is working in the same direction, but nobody is quite there yet," Brosseau said. "At the moment, SAP 
is still the market leader and the one to beat." 
Siebel Systems founder Tom Siebel and Salesforce.com Chief Executive Marc Benioff both served as past 
Oracle executives under Ellison. For his part, Benioff is not backing down. 
In a memo to employees, Benioff wrote that Oracle had put Siebel investors "out of their misery" at last. "We've 
been doing that to Siebel customers for years," he wrote.

Oracle swallows rival Siebel; $5.85-billion deal a ‘customer-driven event'

WASHINGTON -- Oracle Corp., the world's No. 3 software maker, has moved a step closer to its goal of 
becoming a one-stop shop for corporate programming by striking a $5.85-billion (U.S) deal to buy troubled rival 
Siebel Systems Inc. 
Oracle, the world's leading supplier of corporate database software, said yesterday it has offered $10.56 a share 
in cash and stock for Siebel, maker of a near-ubiquitous sales-tracking software that boasts 3.4 million users 
worldwide. 
Oracle chief executive officer Larry Ellison said several of its key customers, including General Electric Co., have 
long demanded a cheaper and simpler way to buy and manage their software. 
“GE and other mutual customers have long encouraged both companies to get together,” Mr. Ellison told 
reporters and analysts on a conference call. 
“It really is a customer-driven event,” echoed Siebel chairman Tom Siebel, a former top Oracle marketing 
executive. 
Most of Siebel's systems already run on the Oracle database and the two companies have numerous mutual 
customers, including GE. 
The purchase price represents a nearly 17-per-cent premium above Siebel's closing stock price last Friday. 
Oracle executives said the deal would likely be consummated early next year, adding an estimated $400-million 
in revenue in fiscal 2006 and $1.3-billion in 2007. 
Oracle has been on an acquisition binge of late, snapping up makers of business applications software — 
programs that automate key tasks such as payroll, inventory and accounting. It has already spent $17.6-billion on 
acquisitions this year. Its most recent purchases have included PeopleSoft Inc., J.D. Edwards and several other 
smaller companies. 
The string of deals has put Oracle in direct competition with SAP AG of Germany — the world's largest maker of 
applications software. 
With the purchase of Siebel, Oracle takes over from SAP as the world's largest provider of so-called customer 
relationship management, or CRM, software. 
Reaction to the software takeover was mixed among analysts, many of whom worry that Oracle may have trouble 
digesting all of its recent acquisitions and consolidating its various software offerings. 
“Oracle remains the king of consolidators in enterprise software,” said Jason Kraft of Susquehanna Financial 
Group in New York. “Software conglomerates are trying to quickly fill gaps in the offerings.” 
But Mr. Kraft pointed out that Oracle's “crown jewel” is its database software franchise, which could get diluted as 
the company moves aggressively into other areas.

The deal is part of an ongoing wave of consolidation in the software business that has seen major players scoop 
up smaller rivals. Anti-virus program maker Symantec Corp. bought Veritas Software Corp. in July. In May, 
International Business Machines Corp. acquired Ascential Software Corp. 
Janet White, an analyst at Info-Tech Research Group in London, Ont., says Oracle's ability to develop new 
products may be impaired as it grows via acquisition. 
“Where Oracle may be able to compete with SAP on numbers in the short term, they may have trouble competing 
longer term on product innovation,” Ms. White said in a research note to clients. 
Mr. Siebel started Siebel in 1993, building it into a thriving dot-com before the technology bubble burst. But it's 
been hurt by a barrage of customer complaints about the complexity of its software architecture. Squeezed by 
larger and smaller rivals, the company has barely grown in the past five years. 
Siebel has also rejected the industry trend of making its products Internet-based. 
Richard Davis, an analyst at Needham and Co. in New York, said the PeopleSoft acquisition was a bigger deal 
financially, but Siebel represents “a larger reclamation project.” He said Oracle may have to cut Siebel's entire 
administrative staff and much of its sales force to make good on a pledge to maintain a 40-per-cent operating 
profit margin after the purchase. 
Oracle has cut 5,000 jobs at PeopleSoft. Siebel has roughly 5,000 employees. 
Speaking to reporters, Oracle's Mr. Ellison tried to allay fears that it was taking on too much. He said the 
company waited patiently until it had fully digested the PeopleSoft purchase before making another deal. 
“The integration [of PeopleSoft] is complete,” he said. “The numbers are good.” 
Siebel shareholders, who must approve the takeover, will have the choice of taking cash or Oracle shares, 
although a maximum of 30 per cent of Siebel's shares can be exchanged for stock.

Software maker Oracle said Monday it will acquire rival Siebel Systems in a deal worth $5.8 billion, marking the 
second major competitor the company has targeted since mid-2004. 
Oracle executives said the mega-deal is intended as a "major beachhead" against archrival SAP, which is the 
world's largest business-applications seller. 
Siebel specializes in customer relationship management (CRM) software. Oracle said the Siebel acquisition will 
add 4,000 customers and 3.4 million CRM users. 
Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison said the deal was in part fueled by requests from partners and customers, 
such as General Electric, that wanted to hold a single company accountable for their applications and also ease 
the integration process. 
Larry Ellison, CEO, Oracle 
"This deal is good for Oracle shareholders and customers," Ellison said in a conference call with analysts. "Many 
of our largest customers, like GE, have encouraged the two companies to get together." 
Oracle will offer $10.66 for each share of Siebel stock, a nearly 17 percent premium over the company's $9.13 
closing price Friday. The deal, subject to approval by Siebel shareholders and by regulators, is expected to close 
next year. 
Ellison included the company in a list of takeover targets during Oracle's controversial and often contentious 
$10.3 billion acquisition of major competitor PeopleSoft, which closed in January. 
Siebel had also been the subject of takeover rumors for some time, particularly since the departure of CEO Mike 
Lawrie in April. 
Oracle said the timing is right for its Siebel acquisition. 
"Tom (Siebel) and I have been talking on and off about this deal for some time," Ellison said. "But we had to 
complete the PeopleSoft integration, and I said we would not do any major mergers until we had successfully 
completed a couple of quarters after the integration." 
Charles Phillips, Oracle's co-president, told CNET News.com in July that the company had largely "digested" the 
PeopleSoft acquisition and was looking for other deals. "Given our size, we can do small, medium and large 
acquisitions, and multiple deals. We have a pretty good process down now," he said. 
Oracle has made other purchases this year as well. In April, the company purchased retail software maker Retek 
for just under $500 million. In early July, Oracle bought pricing specialist ProfitLogic for an undisclosed sum. And 
last month, Oracle took a $650 million stake in Indian banking software maker I-flex Solutions. 
Siebel to be "centerpiece" 
Oracle plans to continue product support for Siebel's CRM technology for a number of years and use the 
company as a "centerpiece" in those efforts. 
"Siebel will be the centerprice of our CRM strategy going forward," Ellison said. "We will continue to sell 
PeopleSoft CRM, Oracle CRM, but Siebel will be the centerpiece."

Page 37 of 165 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Siebel has been struggling financially in recent years, as it has become clear that customers are switching to 
companies that can offer a soup-to-nuts integrated suite, rather than a specialized application, said Tom Siebel, 
founder and chairman of Siebel and a former Oracle executive under Ellison. 
"The shift in market dynamics has occurred over the last three to four to five years," Siebel said. "A couple years 
ago, customers wanted best of breed in a couple of...categories, but now customers and partners are indicating 
they are really looking for a suite of applications to control their costs going forward." 
The two companies' customers, a number of whom they share in common, wanted a single enterprise 
applications vendor to hold accountable and eliminate the headache of having to deal with inconsistent pricing 
terms, upgrades and integration that arises from using multiple vendors, Phillips said.

A large percentage of Siebel's software runs on Oracle's databases, the companies noted. And Siebel's CRM

Siebel technology will also make it into Oracle's Project Fusion, which is designed to produce fully integrated 
software from PeopleSoft and Oracle. Support for PeopleSoft products will expire in 2013. 
Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com, which sells hosted CRM systems that compete with products 
from SAP, Oracle and Siebel, wasted no time in criticizing that plan. 
"Oracle's strategy is simple. Instead of innovating, buy as much installed software as possible, call it all Oracle 
Fusion, and make sure it all uses Oracle's database," Benioff said in a statement Monday. "Now, the same thing 
that happened to PeopleSoft will happen to Siebel; it will die." 
Salesforce.com's annual user conference is this week in San Francisco.

Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ONLINE 
Oracle Corp. (ORCL) continued to try to spend its way into parity with nemesis SAP (SAP), buying out a former 
protege of CEO Larry Ellison. But the spending spree may not be enough. 
Oracle agreed to buy Siebel Systems (SEBL), a competing business-software maker founded by former Oracle 
executive and occasional Ellison-baiter Thomas Siebel, for about $5.85 billion. The deal, which follows a $10.3 
billion purchase of PeopleSoft, a $669 million purchase of Retek and other smaller deals, will help Oracle bulk up 
its offering of customer-relationship management, or CRM, software, which it calls the industry's biggest and 
fastest-growing niche. Though Mr. Siebel, who will get a job at Oracle, has resisted a reunion in the past, he was 
positively bubbling about it today, calling it a "wonderful, exciting event." His newfound gratitude was 
understandable, according to some observers, considering Siebel Systems' dire straits. Prudential Equity analyst 
Brent Thill said Siebel had "deteriorating fundamentals." Its latest earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations, 
competition was eating its lunch and its shareholders were howling for it to sell itself. Siebel's shares, which had 
already risen on rumors of a deal, jumped 13% Monday. 
Though Oracle is still digesting its earlier repasts and will have to take on some debt to buy Siebel, its shares rose 
slightly today. Many analysts cheered the deal. If it is approved by antitrust regulators, who raised a fuss over the 
PeopleSoft merger, the deal would make Oracle tops in CRM. There was talk that bigger rival SAP would counter 
with a purchase of its own, maybe Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM). But SAP sniffed at Oracle's move, vowing to grow 
organically. In any event, the deal still leaves Oracle well short of the competition in the race to build a full-service 
business software suite, said Richard Williams, an analyst at Garban Institutional Equities, who has a rare "sell" 
rating on Oracle. "Oracle is two years behind SAP and Microsoft," he said. "This is a game of urgent catch-up." 
Which is not to say that the competition is in great shape, either. "The only way to make headway is to bring a 
product to market that's like Microsoft Office, where everything is already connected," Williams said. "Until that 
hits the market, customers will be reticent to spend money. That's the reason the growth rate is so slow in 
enterprise software."

Bush: No Racial Bias In Relief Efforts 
President Bush made his first close-up inspection of recovery efforts in New Orleans, riding in a military convoy 
through flooded neighborhoods and occasionally having to duck to dodge tree limbs and downed power lines. 
The tour was the latest step in the White House's campaign to undo the political damage done by widespread 
criticism of the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina. Bush denied that the government's halting 
effort, which left tens of thousands of black New Orleanians stranded for days in increasingly nightmarish 
conditions, was due to racial bias. He did not mention it, but it is certainly true that predominantly white parishes 
and towns in Louisiana and Mississippi also complained bitterly about the pace of federal recovery efforts. Local 
officials have been happier with the government's recent efforts, though, as progress has been made in getting 
evacuees to safety, restoring order and beginning the slow process of rebuilding.

Wachovia Bulks Up Auto-Financing Business 
In the second-biggest deal of Merger Monday, Wachovia agreed to buy Westcorp (WES), a holding company for 
automobile-financing firm WFS Financial (WSFI), for about $3.42 billion. Wachovia, the No. 4 U.S. bank, will also 
buy up all the outstanding shares of WFS for about $490 million. The deal will turn Wachovia into the No. 9 U.S. 
auto lender. Wachovia touted WFS's ability to increase earnings and sales "through all economic cycles." But the 
deal comes at a time when consumer debt is already high, with economists talking about a potential slowdown in 
consumer spending on the horizon. Shares of WFS Financial jumped nearly 8%, while Westcorp shares were 
little changed. Shares of Wachovia fell nearly 2%. 
In another big deal, EBay (EBAY) agreed to buy Skype, a Swedish firm that offers Internet telephone service, for 
about $2.6 billion. The deal was widely anticipated and had little impact on EBay's shares Monday. 
* * *
Stocks Unmoved by Merger Monday 
U.S. stocks seemed underwhelmed by the flurry of deals, barely budging in midday trading. Maybe they were just 
out of gas, after a rally last week that included the Dow Jones Industrial Average's best one-week gain since May. 
The Dow industrials rose about 17 points today, with about 653 million shares changing hands on the Big Board. 
The Nasdaq rose about 10 points, while the S&P 500 rose less than one point. Shares of Delta Airlines (DAL) fell 
19% to about 89 cents as traders geared up for a bankruptcy filing, which could come as soon as this week. 
Crude-oil futures dropped to about $63 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, continuing their 
post-Katrina tumble. 
Treasury bond prices fell, pushing the yield on the 10-year note to nearly 4.2%. "The bond market's bearish stars 
are now coming into worrisome alignment," Morgan Stanley chief economist Stephen Roach, a long-time bond 
bull, told clients, citing a post-Katrina surge in government spending, among other factors. 
The dollar rose against the euro and the Japanese yen. Major European stock markets rose, as did major Asian 
markets.

Roberts Hearing Begins 
The Senate Judiciary Committee began its confirmation hearing for John Roberts, Bush's nominee to become the 
Supreme Court's next chief justice. Most of the day will be consumed by opening statements from the 
committee's senators. Judge Roberts was not expected to deliver his prepared remarks until late in the afternoon, 
and he probably won't have to start answering questions until Tuesday.

China's Trade Surplus Grows 
When China boosted the value of its currency a smidge earlier this year, few observers thought it would make 
much of a difference in China's trade surplus with the rest of the world. They were right, and then some. Rather 
than shrinking, China's trade advantage gathered steam in August, according to a government report. China's 
exports boomed to $67.82 billion, up 32% from a year ago, while imports rose 23% to $57.78 billion. The news 
will likely not please the U.S. manufacturers and politicians who have long agitated for China to revalue its yuan, 
saying the artificially weakened currency gives China an unfair edge in global trade.

(Updates with additional information starting in sixth paragraph.) 
By Chris Reiter 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Oracle Corp. (ORCL) Chief Financial Officer Greg Maffei said Monday the company's 
planned acquisition of Siebel Systems Inc. (SEBL) would add 2 cents to 3 cents a share to fiscal 2007 earnings, 
and that the integration would be smoother than its move for PeopleSoft. 
The addition of Siebel would therefore represent a modest 2%-3% boost to earnings in the year ending May 
2007. Analysts on average estimate Oracle's pro-forma earnings per share of 92 cents a share, according to 
Thomson First Call. 
Oracle made a long-anticipated move for Siebel, the struggling leader in the $8 billion market for customer 
relationship management software. Oracle offered $10.66 a share for Siebel in a cash and stock deal valued at 
about $5.85 billion. 
In a conference call Monday, Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison said the deal meets the company's two main 
acquisition criteria: it is immediately accretive to earnings and it is strategically sound. 
He also said it would be "dramatically easier" to integrate than PeopleSoft, which was acquired in January after a 
prolonged hostile takeover battle, because the deal for Siebel was friendly and because of the experience gained 
in the PeopleSoft process. 
Oracle's move for PeopleSoft has been the subject of market speculation for months. Analysts, however, had 
criticized the prospective deal, because it would add further turmoil to Oracle's applications business. 
Ellison, however, said that Oracle was ready for another big acquisition because the company has completed the 
integration of PeopleSoft and shown that the deal was financially sound. 
"We're now prepared to take on another big acquisition," said Ellison. 
He said the company would continue to look for acquisitions, but doesn't plan any major buys "anytime soon." 
The company would focus on industry-specific software vendors, likely along the lines of its recent moves for 
retail software specialists Retek and ProfitLogic and banking software maker i-flex Solutions Ltd. (IFLX.BO). 
He also said that Oracle would support Siebel products for "many, many years to come." 
Oracle is currently committed to support PeopleSoft products through 2013 and is in the process of melding 
PeopleSoft and Oracle applications into a single system, called Fusion, which is due to be rolled out in 2008. 
Tom Siebel, Siebel's founder and chairman, said his company's acquisition by Oracle was customer-driven and 
the best solution for shareholders, partners and employees. 
Still, some of Siebel's employees will certainly lose their jobs. Oracle CFO Maffei said the company plans to 
"rationalize" duplicate roles after the deal closes in early 2006. Meanwhile, Siebel is set to receive about $400 
million for his stake.

Page 42 of 165 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Siebel, which makes software that tracks customer data and aids sales staff, has been struggling in recent 
quarters, issuing two consecutive profit warnings and ousting its chief executive after the first quarter. Specialized 
vendors, like Siebel, have faced a difficult environment as software buyers put increasing emphasis on integration 
of various components. 
Mr. Siebel acknowledged that this market shift was a driving force behind the decision to sell the company. 
Oracle has been building out its applications business in order to augment its core database operations. It 
competes with leader SAP AG (SAP) in the $43 billion applications software market. 
Oracle President Charles Phillips said the Siebel acquisition will provide "another beachhead" against SAP, which 
also competes in the customer relationship management software market. 
Oracle will finance the acquisition with at most 30% stock, the remainder will be paid for by borrowing about $3 
billion and using about $1.5 billion from its cash reserves, which totaled $3.9 billion at the end of May. 
Oracle's Maffei also said the company plans to repurchase shares after the deal to address dilution and make the 
deal effectively a cash transaction. 
Oracle shares recently traded at $13.35, up 7 cents, or 0.5%. Siebel shares shot up $1.19, or 13%, to $10.32.

Siebel Will Be 'Centerpiece' Of Oracle CRM Strategy After $5.85 Billion Deal 
Siebel Will Be 'Centerpiece' Of Oracle CRM Strategy After $5.85 Billion Deal

Oracle on Monday disclosed plans to acquire CRM-market leader Siebel Systems Inc. for $5.85 billion, a deal that 
brings together two of the software industry's largest business-application providers. 
The proposed deal already has been approved by Siebel's board of directors, clearing the way for what should be 
a smoother closing than Oracle's long battle to acquire PeopleSoft, which closed last December. "This is 
dramatically easier than the PeopleSoft transition," Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said in a conference call to discuss 
the deal. 
In the same way that Oracle was attracted to PeopleSoft for the large installed base of companies using 
PeopleSoft's human-resources applications, it's Siebel's base of 4,000 customer-relationship-management 
accounts and 3.4 million user licenses that are driving Oracle's bid this time. The CRM market is expected to grow 
to $10 billion by 2009, according to research firm IDC. Oracle and Siebel are responding in part to the rapid 
growth of competitor Salesforce.com and its hosted applications model. 
If the deal goes through, Oracle will end up with three different CRM suites in its product portfolio. Oracle already 
sells and is continuing to develop its own CRM applications in an applications project called Fusion that's under 
way. In addition, the company continues to sell and support CRM applications formerly marketed by PeopleSoft. 
Ellison said Siebel's CRM suite will become the "centerpiece" of Oracle's CRM strategy going forward. Oracle will 
invest heavily in continuing to move all of the features of Siebel's CRM suite to Siebel's smaller but strategically 
important on-demand offering. 
Ellison disagreed with a questioner who suggested that some significant share of Siebel's customers are 
unhappy with their Siebel software. "They're certainly not complaining to us" about Siebel's software, Ellison 
said. 
Siebel chairman Tom Siebel has given his blessing to the acquisition, pledging to vote his share in its favor. 
"What really brought this together was a shift in market dynamics," Siebel said. Businesses are no longer 
interested in buying best-of-breed applications and now want integrated suites from a single vendor, he said. 
Oracle has been on an acquisition binge for the past year. Oracle and PeopleSoft signed a $10.3 billion merger 
agreement last December, capping a contentious 18-month takeover. Since then, Oracle has acquired or 
disclosed plans to acquire Context Media, i-flex, Oblix, ProfitLogic, Retek, TimesTen, and TripleHop. 
The deal also means that IBM could be feeling increasingly boxed in by Oracle, which is making a habit of 
acquiring key IBM application partners. Last year it was PeopleSoft, with whom IBM had a number of 
development, service, and marketing deals. Now, it's Siebel. IBM offers Siebel's CRM software on a hosted basis 
through its Global Services arm. It also has teamed with the ISV on government projects and a number of big 
services engagements.

NEW YORK, Sept 12 (AFP) - 
US business software giant Oracle Corp. agreed Monday to buy Siebel Systems in a 5.85 billion dollar deal that 
gives the Silicon Valley firm a leg up in its rivalry with Germany's SAP. 
The deal gives Oracle -- the world's second largest software group after Microsoft but behind SAP in business 
management applications -- a strong base in an area of software known as customer-relationship management 
(CRM). 
"In a single step, Oracle becomes the number one CRM applications company in the world," said Oracle chief 
executive Larry Ellison. 
"Siebel's 4,000 applications customers and 3,400,000 CRM users strengthen our number one position in 
applications in North America and move us closer to the number one position in applications globally." 
The deal brings Oracle a step closer to SAP in the field of enterprise software, which covers accounting, inventory 
management and customer management. 
It also puts Oracle at the top in the fast-growing area of customer relationship management, which aims to helps 
companies track and automate many aspects of their dealings with customers. 
"This deal gives Oracle a much needed boost in the customer management application market," said analysts at 
AMR Research, adding that with Siebel, Oracle is now "in a dead heat with SAP" in the sector. 
"This is a very important transaction for Oracle," according to ThinkEquity Partners analyst Peter Coleman. "This 
was a must-have deal for Oracle" in its competition with SAP, he said. 
The acquisition will also heat up competition with upstart Salesforce, which has carved out a niche by providing 
customer-relationship management software via an Internet subscription service. 
Globally, CRM software sales are estimated at around eight billion dollars annually and are expected to grow to 
10 million dollars by 2009, according to International Data Corp. 
The companies put the total value of the transaction at 5.85 billion dollars, a figure that reflects Siebel's 2.24 
billion dollars in cash on hand. 
The companies expect the deal, which already has received the approval of Siebel's board, to close in early 2006. 
Company founder and chairman Tom Siebel has agreed to vote his stock in favor of the transaction. 
The latest announcement marked another coup for Oracle and Ellison, who outmaneuvered SAP in taking 
control of software rival PeopleSoft after an 18-month struggle that included courtroom fights and legal battles. 
Oracle raised its profits by three percent over its latest fiscal quarter to 1.02 billion dollars, its first earnings since 
integrating PeopleSoft. 
Oracle this year won a bidding war for business software maker Retek after SAP dropped out.

Page 45 of 165 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Oracle said the acquisition of Siebel helps bring some of its big customers to a single software firm for most of its 
needs. 
"This is a customer driven event. Our joint customers have consistently recommended this transaction to both 
companies for over a year," said Oracle president Charles Phillips. 
"We will embrace Siebel's best-in-class CRM products and make the features of those products the centerpiece 
of our Project Fusion CRM," which seeks to integrate customers from PeopleSoft and its acquisition, JD Edwards. 
"We view this acquisition as near term beneficial to Oracle as the company has shown that it can drive earnings 
upside from the acquisition of large maintenance bases as they have done in previous acquisitions such as 
PeopleSoft and Retek," said Citigroup analyst Tom Berquist. 
"On a more intermediate term basis it raises additional questions about the future application footprint, Project 
Fusion." 
Oracle shares rose 1.6 percent to 13.49 on the news while Siebel shot up 12.7 percent to 10.29.

Oracle said the acquisition of Siebel helps bring some of its big customers to a single software firm for most of its 
needs. 
"This is a customer driven event. Our joint customers have consistently recommended this transaction to both 
companies for over a year," said Oracle president Charles Phillips. 
"We will embrace Siebel's best-in-class CRM products and make the features of those products the centerpiece 
of our Project Fusion CRM."

Soft Shell: The Glut in the Valley

For years now, Larry Ellison has been warning that the good old days of the software business are gone forever. 
There's a tendency in Silicon Valley to ignore Ellison's skeptical view, and to conclude instead that the next big 
thing is just around the corner, that we're just one breakthrough away from some mega-billion-dollar opportunity 
that will bring a new round of riches. But the Oracle founder has loudly proclaimed that idea to be hooey, and 
instead asserted that we inevitably are headed for a period of intense consolidation, where the big will get bigger, 
and the small will get eaten or squashed. Of course, Ellison hasn't only been preaching the gospel of 
consolidation, he's been following his own advice, as illustrated by the company's mammoth 2004 acquisition of 
PeopleSoft and a host of other deals. 
-- And here's the interesting thing: The culling of the enterprise software sector is probably far from over. In recent 
weeks, in fact, merger and acquisition activity among software companies has reached a fevered pace. According 
to the 451 Group, a New York-based market research firm, M&A outlays in the software sector for the quarter to 
date is up more than 300% from the same period last year, with a better than 50% increase in the number of 
deals. 
And it's not as if there has been a shortage of deal flow in recent years. Since the end of 2000, according to 
FactSet Mergerstat, there have been more than 12,000 acquisitions in the software sector, with a combined value 
well north of $200 billion. (The dollar total would be even bigger if all deal terms had been disclosed.) In the 
process, some storied software names have been swallowed: PeopleSoft, JD Edwards, Macromedia, Veritas, 
SunGard, Legato and Documentum, to name just a few. And yet, even after all that activity, it seems clear that 
there are still far, far more software companies than the world really needs. 
The problem is this: The enterprise, or corporate, software business faces a world in which there is little organic 
growth, few compelling new applications and a dearth of untapped customers. Companies that need enterprise 
software mostly have what they need -- and then some. Roger McNamee, a long-time technology investor and 
the founder of the private-equity firm Elevation Partners, asserts that the software business isn't just growing up; it 
has already reached adulthood. 
"It's mature with a capital M," McNamee says. "No one under 17 allowed." He notes that while software giants like 
Oracle, Microsoft and SAP have made incremental improvements in their product offerings in recent years, none 
has introduced a new enterprise application that matters in a long, long time. The most important piece of 
software to be created in the last five years, McNamee posits, is not some high-price tag corporate 
resource-planning application: It's Google. "The software companies' great problem right now is that they make 
really great locomotives, the interstate highway system has just been completed and the world is moving to 
trucks." 
Tony Rizzo, research director at the 451 Group, notes that the larger companies are finding it increasingly hard to 
provide unique advantages over the competition. Software, and technology more generally, is being 
commoditized. So the companies, he says, "are making not strategic but tactical acquisitions, looking for 
customer growth or little pieces of technology to up-sell to their installed base." Oracle's acquisition of PeopleSoft, 
he points out, was just such a deal, giving Oracle a way to increase its customer base and, ultimately, to convert 
PeopleSoft customers to Oracle customers. 
Lacking compelling new markets, and facing saturated demand for their existing wares, the industry's largest 
players are doing the logical thing: They're taking advantage of their strong balance sheets and buying growth. 
They are, it seems, proving that Larry Ellison knew exactly what he was talking about all along.

The ranks of potential acquirers include the industry's largest players-Oracle, International Business Machines, 
SAP, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, Computer Associates and Symantec, to name a few -- and they all come 
equipped with piles of cash and valuable deal-currency in their stocks. 
So you might think it was time to back up the truck and pile into smaller software stocks, right? Well, that's a nice 
theory, but it has some serious flaws. 
Pip Coburn, the former UBS technology strategist who recently formed Coburn Ventures, a boutique investment 
firm, asserts that, while mergers will continue to thin the software herd, the majority of small- and medium-sized 
software companies will find themselves in a kind of no-man's land, with stagnant growth, a dearth of bidders and, 
in the case of private companies, no hope of ever going public. 
He figures we could see a growing class of undead companies, the software zombies. Coburn points out that in 
many cases, the premiums being paid for public software companies have been thin. In a few cases, as in the 
acquisition by the private equity firm Vector Capital Group of the one-time high-flyer Broadvision, the companies 
agreed to a "take-under," or price below the previous public market share price. Coburn argues for selling short a 
basket of smaller software stocks. 
Chuck Phillips, the former Morgan Stanley software analyst who now serves as co-president of Oracle, said in an 
interview last week that there are two primary factors driving the industry's consolidation. One is customer 
behavior; corporate IT managers who once preferred to buy niche products and mesh them together have 
switched to a strategy of seeking more complete solutions to their computing issues. "In the Internet boom, the 
opposite was true," Phillips says. "But now the old way has proven to be a failed model, a more expensive model. 
Now people want to buy packages, or outsource. " 
The other key consolidation driver, Phillips says, has been a shift in technology away from proprietary systems to 
more open models. "The risk of consolidating software companies was much higher 10 years ago," he says. 
"Each company built proprietary technology, using proprietary languages, and sometimes proprietary databases. 
There was no way to simply plug them in. With Web services, there are standard ways of presenting applications, 
which makes it easier to integrate applications from different companies." 
R. Allen Cinzori, vice president of San Diego-based Software Equity Group, a boutique investment bank, notes 
that the recent acquisition binge has begun to thin the ranks of potential buyers, a development with unsettling 
implications for sellers. Think of Oracle buying PeopleSoft, which itself had acquired J.D. Edwards -- where once 
there were three potential buyers, now there is one. 
In a recent report, Software Equity noted that over the 30 months through June, 27 software companies came 
public, while more than 150 others were acquired. Doug Gonsalves, a managing director with SVB Alliant, an 
investment banking arm of Silicon Valley Bank, says the number of venture-backed software companies selling 
out has lately exceeded the number of new companies being funded, the first time that's happened in a decade. 
"Historically," Software Equity Group observed in a report on second-quarter merger activity, "software IPOs and 
smaller, rapidly growing public companies would quickly take up the slack left by recently acquired public 
companies. That's not happening today at a rate nearly sufficient to maintain a constant number of buyers." 
That may not seem consistent with the recent spurt in deal volume, but the trend is clear. While there are some 
aggressive shoppers out there looking for deals, there are increasingly fewer of them. And with private software 
companies largely unable to access the initial-public-offering market, the demand for the attentions of the 
software giants is high. For small software companies, Cinzori concludes, "the probability of selling is 
diminishing." 
It's becoming a buyer's market. Oracle's Phillips asserts that many companies have concluded that they need to 
sell out or suffer the consequences. "They are coming to us now, thinking if they're not the one bought, they will 
have a hard time. They are knocking on our doors." 
In the chart on page 23, you'll find a list of recent deals by 10 of the larger players; together they account for a 
sizable chunk of overall deal volume. (see accompanying illustration -- Barron's Aug. 29, 2005) Where might the 
acquirers strike next? Any discussion like that has to start with Oracle (ticker: ORCL), which has been moving 
aggressively to expand its line-up of enterprise applications, even beyond its acquisition of PeopleSoft. 
Oracle has been going after "vertical markets," buying software companies with products for the retail and 
banking sectors. And clearly the company is not finished: Phillips says Oracle is also eyeing acquisitions of 
companies selling software for the telecom, health-care and government sectors.

Page 50 of 165 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Phillips doesn't expect a lot of competition for those companies. In several of Oracle's acquisitions, most notably 
its $670 million deal for retail-industry software firm Retek, SAP has been the losing bidder, consistently showing 
more restraint than Oracle on price. "People have learned that it's not a good idea to bid against us," Phillips 
says. "They think we're a little bit crazy." 
Eventually, Oracle could shift its acquisition search toward companies that would provide more diversification 
away from its core database software and applications businesses, he continues. For instance, Phillips says, 
Oracle could target content companies, in particular providers of specialized industry databases used by existing 
customers in, say, consumer lending and insurance. "Every industry has databases used to make decisions, and 
we could offer them as one-stop shopping," he says. "It would be a nice complement." 
Rick Sherlund, the long-time software analyst at Goldman Sachs, wonders why Oracle hasn't put more of its 
energies into buying software infrastructure, bolstering its core database software offering. "The synergies might 
actually be stronger on the infrastructure side," Sherlund says. "They feel compelled to beef up in applications, 
which can drive demand for Oracle databases. But it's more difficult to do the integration work with those." 
Oracle, of course, is not the only company in the hunt. A smaller but still significant consolidator is Symantec 
(SYMC). The security-software company got some backlash from the Street for its controversial acquisition this 
year of storage specialist Veritas, which some observers thought didn't offer enough synergies. "The leap from 
security to storage management was pretty large," McNamee says, "but there are clear synergies. Even if all you 
get are savings on G&A [general and administrative expenses] it's quite significant. Where Oracle and PeopleSoft 
had huge product overlap, Veritas and Symantec had very different sales strategies. The goal would be to use 
increased scale to access higher levels in customer organizations and lower the ultimate cost of selling." 
McNamee thinks the Street's skepticism of the deal is misplaced: "I will be stunned if the deal does not turn out to 
be very good from an investor's perspective." Meanwhile, Symantec continues to add to its core business: In 
mid-August, it bought Sygate, a privately held security-compliance company. 
Among the more aggressive acquirers in recent months has been EMC (EMC), which continues to make the 
stretch from storage hardware to software, with the acquisition of companies like VMware, Documentum and 
Legato. McNamee points to the difference between EMC and Sun, which in 2000 were in the same place. "EMC 
made a 90-degree turn, and the other guy plowed straight ahead," he says. "The result is that the whole company 
feels better about themselves. Customers feel like they are doing interesting things." In the company's latest deal, 
EMC this month snapped up storage-software concern Rainfinity. 
Germany-based SAP (SAP) has moved more slowly on the acquisition front. Says McNamee: "SAP's attitude is, 
`if I can spend $100 million building a product, why should I spend $1 billion to buy it?' In their view, there are lot 
of people in India they can put on projects. They'd rather increase R&D to ramp up on new things." 
And let's not forget Microsoft (MSFT). CEO Steve Ballmer has made it clear that the world's biggest software 
company plans to pick up its acquisition pace. Speaking at a meeting for financial analysts last month, Ballmer 
noted that the company had "dialed up the pace of acquisitions." Ballmer said Microsoft was "unlikely to do 
blockbuster acquisitions," though it has shown a willingness to consider them, having held exploratory talks last 
year about combining forces with SAP in a deal that likely would have faced intense regulatory scrutiny. Ballmer 
described the company's current pace of deals as a "very strong" $100 million to $500 million a year, adding that 
the total could hit $1billion to $2 billion a year going forward. 
Coburn notes that Microsoft could actually do any size deal it wants, partly the result of Ballmer making the 
company "more lovable" after spending billions to settle most pending litigation. (A page-one article in the New 
York Times last week asserted that Google has replaced Microsoft as the company Silicon Valley loves to hate.) 
Nonetheless, Coburn thinks Microsoft will focus specifically on security, in part to deter security-conscious 
defectors to Linux and Apple Computer (AAPL.) 
Nick Patience, who runs the enterprise-software practice at the 451 Group, thinks Microsoft might target various 
management software niches. He ranks NetIQ (NTIQ) as a likely target, pointing out that Microsoft already offers 
products built on software licensed from the company. Other possible targets, he figures, include Altiris (ATRS), 
Opsware (OPSW), Mercury Interactive (MERQE) and Quest Software (QSFT). 
Some analysts think the SAP talks point to Microsoft's continued interest in the enterprise application market. But 
its previous acquisitions in that area, including Great Plains and Navision, which sell business software for small 
and mid-sized companies, have produced disappointing results. And short of making another pass at SAP, its 
options in that area are limited.

Page 51 of 165 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
IBM (IBM) has quietly been one of the most aggressive shoppers for small software companies: Over the last four 
years, the company has closed 25 deals, says John Prial, vice president for information management in the 
company's software group. Unlike, Oracle, IBM has been focused strictly on infrastructure plays, and Prial says 
that will continue. Sherlund suggests the company could make a bigger move into the so-called business 
intelligence market-software that helps spot trends in corporate data -- the province of outfits like Cognos (COGN) 
and Business Objects (BOBJ). 
IBM says it isn't interested in jumping into the applications market, and for good reason: to avoid offending key 
partners, in particular SAP. Despite that stance, Sherlund contends "IBM and SAP would make a nice fit," which 
could drive considerable business to Big Blue's services arm, and potentially steal database business from Oracle 
and Microsoft. "It would be a strategically complementary merger for IBM," he says. "I'm sure they were quite 
apprehensive when they learned that Microsoft had discussions with SAP." 
The wild-card buyer in the software business is the growing pool of private-equity capital, at a time when taking 
software companies private actually makes some sense. In the past, when the software industry was growing at 
double-digit rates, LBO investors generally ignored the sector in favor of slower-growing companies with more 
predictable cash flows. But many software companies now generate a large portion of their revenues from highly 
predictable -- and highly profitable -- maintenance revenues, covering the costs of upgrades and support. 
The highest profile software LBO was the $11.4 billion acquisition of SunGard Data Systems this year by a 
consortium of private equity buyers lead by Silver Lake Partners. It was the biggest LBO since the 1989 
acquisition of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. 
But there have been quite a few others, including Vector's recent acquisition of BroadVision and its previous 
purchase of Corel; investments by General Atlantic and Cerebus Partners in SSA Global (SSAG), which recently 
completed a rare software IPO; the acquisition by Golden Gate Capital, Francisco Partners and Thoma Cressey 
Equity Partners of Attachmate; and Golden Gate's purchase of Blue Martini. 
OK, so what's an investor to do? You could dabble in some of the hotter sectors, like security, but that approach 
has risks. "I would be very concerned about security right now," says SVB Alliant's Gonsalves. "VCs are throwing 
money at the sector left and right. There's an over-population of companies. There are some really cool 
technologies out there, and lots of them. Right now, multiples are very high, and it's a sellers' market. But it's 
attracting lots of capital. Sometime down the road, it will become a buyers' market." 
Another option would be to buy shares of the most well-telegraphed targets, like Siebel Systems (SEBL) and BEA 
Systems (BEAS), both much-discussed potential tidbits for Oracle. But it's not clear that Ellison in the end will 
buy either one. Nor is it clear that either has a strong long-term survival position. 
"Siebel is in real trouble," Pip Coburn says. "I don't see them getting bought, or buying anything that will turn them 
around. They're caught between saying they're a growth company and cleaning up their operating model and 
driving earnings. Investors want them to come up with a miracle." 
And BEA? The 451 Group's Rizzo doesn't see what BEA can do that would substantially improve its growth 
prospects, which are challenged by competition in the application server market with offerings from IBM, Oracle 
and SAP, among others. "At the end of the day, Oracle looms large as a potential acquirer," he says. "IBM and a 
few others have saturated the market environment, leaving very little room to find new customers. BEA is 
targeting the telecommunications carrier market, but that's also IBM's next move. Time is on Oracle's side: BEA 
knows there is very little market growth ahead of it." 
Meanwhile, investors at hedge funds and elsewhere are scouring the market for potential acquisitions, and often 
bidding up the shares of target companies before any deal is ever announced. Mike Greenough, CEO of 
Chicago-based SSA Global, says that shares of E.Piphany (EPNY) ran up 27% in the 90 days before SSA 
announced a pact to buy the company. A similar sharp rise occurred in shares of Plumtree Software (PLUM) in 
the weeks leading up to last week's announcement that the company was being acquired by BEA. "This is a very 
small community, and hedge funds seem to know which ones are going to be taken out," Greenough says. "So 
the acquisition premiums in many cases are already built into the stocks." 
The biggest danger to those fishing for acquisition targets is that the deals never materialize. Coburn contends 
that "the real consolidation will happen by irrelevancy." More companies will fade away than get bought, he 
figures. "Ariba missed their April quarter," he says. "I asked people if they even noticed, and 98% said `no.' They 
have become pretty much irrelevant. There are hundreds of software companies, and most of them will become 
irrelevant." Companies of that ilk will have trouble commanding much of a premium in a sale, if in fact they can 
find a buyer at all.

Page 52 of 165 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Coburn notes that E.Piphany was sold at a premium of just 7% over the previous price, and that Oracle paid a 
similarly modest premium in its recent deal to buy a majority stake in iFlex, the India-based banking software 
company. "If my downside is only 7%, then as a short, boy, I feel good," Coburn says. 
In the end, it looks like Ellison had it right. The big will get bigger, and the small will struggle to survive. Philips 
argues that it will all come down to Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and IBM, with everyone else scrambling for the 
crumbs. That may slightly exaggerate the case, but he's got the direction right. Some day, someone will figure out 
a new piece of code that companies will simply have to own. But no one knows what that will be. And a lot of 
today's software companies may not be around by the time we all figure it out.

Shopping for Small Software Companies 
Plugged In 
Shopping for Small Software Companies

Larry Ellison has a shopping list full of software companies. The founder of database giant Oracle has spent 
$11.1 billion to buy PeopleSoft, a maker of programs to automate human-resources functions, in a bid to stay 
ahead of Germany's SAP. Now, he's got his eye on software makers attuned to the way specific industries work. 
Oracle (ticker: ORCL) has done three such deals this year, outbidding SAP (SAP) to buy Retek for $700 million 
and making an undisclosed bid for ProfitLogic. Both those companies help retailers manage store inventory. 
Oracle also is offering nearly $1 billion for i-Flex Solutions, an Indian company that helps run banking operations. 
Oracle, SAP and other software giants know that higher growth will come in the industries served by the 50 small 
and midsize companies that account for most of the $72.8 billion in business software sales, says Evan Quinn, an 
analyst with International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. "There's going to be a huge battle for these firms," 
says Ray Wang, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. 
Sales of the stuff that Oracle and SAP peddle, called enterprise-resource-planning software, will grow only 6.3% a 
year from 2005 through 2009, says Gartner Inc., a research outfit in Stamford, Conn. That's well below the 8% 
annual sales gain that Gartner projects for the rest of application software. 
"Greater growth is in the smaller areas of this market," says Gartner analyst Simon Hayward. Companies in 
industries that for years wrote their own programs now want to buy packaged software, says Mary Wardley, 
another analyst at IDC. As companies tie their Websites to their inventory databases while sending information to 
an increasingly mobile staff, the complexity of, and demand for, such programs has risen. Says Wardley: 
"Companies don't want to build and maintain this stuff anymore. They want to focus their resources on other parts 
of their business." 
But business-software companies command nearly twice the price-earnings multiple of the S&P 500 (based on 
projected earnings over the next four quarters), so it's tough to find bargains. 
Dendrite International (DRTE) and Amdocs (DOX) are a couple of exceptions that have specific industry expertise 
and offer growth at relatively modest valuations. 
Drug giant Pfizer (PFE) paid $112 million last year for software from Dendrite, and it's just one among several 
blue-chip drug makers in the company's star-studded client base. 
Dendrite started out making software to manage drug makers' sales forces, but it has steadily gotten its hooks 
into other operations of Big Pharma, including software to plan direct-mail campaigns and manage clinical trials. 
Its databases of medical prescriptions help drug makers project sales more precisely. 
Dendrite is 13% under its 52-week high and is down 11.4% this year. At around 17, it fetches 16.4 times projected 
earnings for the next four quarters, well below its median price-earnings ratio of 20 times forward earnings, 
according to Thomson Financial/Baseline. 
The telecommunications industry is another attractive area for software makers. Spending on high-speed Internet 
connections and cellphones will rise 6% this year and 7% in 2006, Gartner estimates. 
Amdocs took in $1.8 billion last year in software sales to telephone companies. Its software can pull a customer's 
billing history out of a database so a service rep sees it immediately.. "They have a large, defensible position in 
what they do," says analyst Michael Sansoterra of Principal Global Investors in Des Moines, Iowa, which

Page 54 of 165 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
manages $155.4 billion and owns Oracle and Amdocs shares. He likes Amdocs' big-name customers, like Sprint 
(FON). 
Amdocs is dearer than Dendrite, having risen 62% in the past 12 months. But the stock still is 60% below its 
five-year high of 80 and sports a P/E to growth multiple much lower than its rivals' average 2.3 times projected 
earnings growth, according to Baseline. Analysts expect Amdocs to boost earnings 17% in 2006. 
Most of Dendrite's competitors in health care are private start-ups, according to Hoover's. Amdocs spars with 
Convergys (CVG), a public company a third of its size. 
Of course, if Oracle were to buy their competitors, the going could get tougher for Amdocs and Dendrite. "The 
consolidators like Oracle will have the upper hand" in the long run, says Tony Ursillo, an analyst with Loomis 
Sayles in Boston. 
"The good news for the investor is that consolidation is going to continue for several years" in enterprise software, 
says IDC's Quinn. That should let investors in smaller software companies profit in the short term, regardless of 
whether the big boys make their moves.

Oracle Agrees To Buy I-Flex, Pushing Deeper Into Finance; Part Of Consolidation Strategy; Oracle to

Oracle continued its aggressive buying spree Tuesday, saying it would purchase the majority interest in I-flex, an 
India-based maker of software for the banking industry. 
Oracle plans to pay $593 million for 41% of the company -- a stake that's currently owned by Citigroup Venture 
Capital International. Oracle also expects to pay up to $316 million more for an additional 20% of I-flex shares. 
Buying I-flex should give Oracle a strong foothold in the lucrative financial services sector, says Kevin Buttigieg, 
an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons. That could give the company a boost as it battles archrival SAP, he says. 
"This latest acquisition by Oracle is about growing their market opportunity and positioning for future growth," 
Buttigieg said. 
Oracle and SAP are engaged in a "land grab" for software turf, says Bruce Richardson, an analyst at AMR 
Research. Each looks to capture as many industries as possible. 
SAP is the market leader in software for manufacturers, while Oracle is more focused on the service sector. 
Oracle looks to tap retail, banking, insurance, health care and government markets. 
"Oracle sees their next opportunity for growth in all these service markets," he said. "They're betting that SAP 
can't move as fast as they can in these industries.. 
The value of the I-flex transaction will range from $593 million to $909 million, depending on the amount tendered 
by shareholders. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year. If so, Oracle will control a 61% 
stake in I-flex. 
I-flex will retain its management team and function as a unit of Oracle based in Mumbai, India. I-flex stock will 
continue to trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India. 
The I-flex deal reinforces a goal of Oracle CEO Larry Ellison: consolidating the business software market. Oracle 
sealed a $10.3 billion deal in January to buy PeopleSoft, which makes software to run finances and human 
resources. 
Also this year, Oracle bought Retek and ProfitLogic, which both serve the retail sector. The push into banking 
with I-flex was a logical next step, says David Rudow of Piper Jaffray & Co. 
"We believe the deal falls right in line with Oracle's stated acquisition strategy and think I-flex's domain expertise 
in the banking vertical (market) should create additional selling opportunities," Rudow wrote in a note to investors. 
On a call with Wall Street analysts last week, Oracle President Charles Phillips said investors are starting to see 
Oracle's acquisition strategy as "a competitive weapon," rather than a risk. "We have a huge advantage over SAP 
where we can change the game," Phillips said. "They haven't had any real success with vertical industries.. 
Despite Oracle's buying binge, it still has about $5 billion in cash reserves, minus some debt from the PeopleSoft 
deal, says Buttigieg. He doesn't rule out another deal in the months ahead. "I don't think this deal precludes them 
from doing a larger acquisition," he said.

MUMBAI: Enterprise software and database company, the $12bn Oracle, which is the second-largest software 
company in the world after Microsoft, is buying out Citigroup's 41% stake in Mumbai-based banking software 
company i-flex Solutions. The buyout of the Citigroup stake is at Rs 800 per share, amounting to nearly Rs 2,476 
crore. 
Oracle is also making an open offer at Rs 882 a share for the remaining 20% to public shareholders, amounting 
to Rs 1,323 crore or $361m. Hence, the total size of the deal is Rs 3,799 crore, ie, almost $874m, making it the 
largest buyout in India. The 41% Citigroup stake was held by Citigroup Venture Capital (CVC) through a 100% 
subsidiary Orbitech. 
“Banking is a strategic industry for Oracle with nine out of the top 10 banks already running Oracle ERP 
applications. Oracle's overall application strategy is to go beyond ERP and offer customers richer industry-specific 
functionality. i-flex gets us there in banking,” Oracle's CEO Larry Ellison was quoted as saying in a press release. 
The current i-flex management team will continue to run the company and will align product development, sales, 
marketing and services activities with Oracle. Oracle president Charles Phillips will join the i-flex board, and i-flex 
stock will continue to trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE). The i-flex 
scrip ended at Rs 892, up 8.2% on Tuesday. The announcement came after market hours. 
The last major buyout in the software industry was Flextronics buying out News Corp's stake in Hughes Software 
for close to $226m last year. JM Morgan Stanley advised Oracle on the transaction, while Citigroup advised CVC. 
Oracle has cash balances of more than $4bn on its balance sheet as per its results announced on June 29, '05. 
i-flex was called Citicorp Information Technology Industries (CITIL). Earlier, Citigroup diluted its equity stake in the 
company through a public issue. 
ET had asked the i-flex management about a possible deal on July 18, '05, but company officials had denied that 
any buyout by Oracle was in the offing. Though officials may have denied it to newspapers, the market seems to 
have had a hint of the deal. The news of the buyout by Oracle has been in the market for more than 21 days, and 
despite a poor quarterly performance by the company, the stock price of i-flex has been touching annual highs. 
i-flex earns 50% of its revenues through the sale of its core banking solution, while the remaining revenues come 
from implementation and support services. The acquisition will enable Oracle to become the largest enterprise 
vendor in India with the addition of i-flex's revenues. Oracle will also be able to establish a foothold in the core 
banking solution market worldwide. 
Oracle has been on a buying spree for more than two years now. The company has acquired PeopleSoft 
(enterprise applications), Retek (retail applications), ProfitLogic (retail applications) and Oblix (identity-based 
security solutions). 
On July 29, i-flex had reported a net profit of Rs 15 crore for the quarter ended June 30, '05, a sharp drop of 63% 
compared to Rs 41 crore for the corresponding quarter last year. i-flex posted a topline growth of 22% in revenue 
for the quarter at Rs 274 crore, compared to Rs 224 crore for the corresponding quarter during the previous year. 
As per US GAAP, i-flex's net profit showed a sharper drop of 85% at Rs 6 crore, compared to Rs 42 crore in the 
corresponding quarter in the previous year. 
Commenting on the financials of the company, officials said, “Overall this quarter, licence fee revenues fell and 
total contribution of licensing sales of revenues fell to 22% against 35% for the full year '04-05. This has impacted

the bottomline and has a much higher impact due to deferral of other revenue items to the extent of Rs 40 crore 
under US GAAP.” 
The company's services business is not as profitable as its product business, according to analysts. 
The company has been facing a slowdown in the sale of its products. The net profit of the company has also been 
affected by the fall in utilisation rate of its employees to 69% from an average of 75% and above. The company is 
carrying out a cost-containment exercise to stop the decline in profits. 
Company officials claim that the total deferral of revenues will be to the tune of Rs 120 crore, which will be 
reflected in the balance sheet. They say that revenues are deferred due to contractual clauses or milestones or 
non-payment of dues, though the effort has been expended with costs recorded. Officials were not willing to 
commit on which quarter these revenues will start reflecting as actual payments or revenues. 
On average, every sale of its banking product results in 35% of its revenue coming from licensing, 18-20% from 
annual maintenance contract and the remaining from implementation and customisation. The deferred revenues 
also have a large portion of licensing revenues component in it. i-flex is in the middle of implementing the roll-out 
of its products at Citibank branches the world over.

MUMBAI: Enterprise software and database company, the $12bn Oracle, which is the second-largest software 
company in the world after Microsoft, is buying out Citigroup's 41% stake in Mumbai-based banking software 
company i-flex Solutions. The buyout of the Citigroup stake is at Rs 800 per share, amounting to nearly Rs 2,476 
crore. 
Oracle is also making an open offer at Rs 882 a share for the remaining 20% to public shareholders, amounting 
to Rs 1,323 crore or $361m. Hence, the total size of the deal is Rs 3,799 crore, ie, almost $874m, making it the 
largest buyout in India. The 41% Citigroup stake was held by Citigroup Venture Capital (CVC) through a 100%

paragraph.) 
By Chris Reiter 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Oracle Corp. (ORCL) doesn't plan to buy all of the shares in India's i-flex Solutions Ltd. 
(IFLX.BO) and says the banking-software maker will remain publicly traded. 
Oracle Tuesday said it agreed to buy up to 61% of i-flex for a total of $909 million. It's buying Citigroup Venture 
Capital's 41% stake outright for $593 million and will tender a public offer for up to 20% of the remaining shares 
for up to $316 million. 
In an interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Oracle President Charles Phillips said the company has no plans to 
acquire the remaining shares in i-flex. 
"We see value in the company remaining publicly traded," said Phillips. 
The acquisition is the latest move by Oracle to shore up its business-management applications business as it 
battles Germany's SAP AG (SAP) for dominance of the $12 billion market. 
This year, Oracle has spent over $11 billion on acquisitions in this segment, snapping up PeopleSoft after a 
prolonged hostile takeover battle as well as retail software makers Retek and ProfitLogic. 
Acquisitions are a key part of Oracle's strategy to generate 20% annual earnings growth, Chief Executive Larry 
Ellison said recently. 
Oracle's Phillips said the i-flex acquisition gives Oracle banking-specific functionality that it didn't previously have. 
"There's almost no product overlap," he said. 
"Strategically, we view the deal positively," said Bank of America Securities analyst Stephen Mahedy in a note. 
"I-flex gives Oracle a strong presence in the retail and corporate banking markets." 
Bank of America has an investment-banking relationship with Oracle. 
I-flex provides core banking software to its 575 customers in 115 countries. In the fiscal year ended March, i-flex 
posted net profit of $47 million on revenue of $261 million. 
Oracle, the world's largest database maker, reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income for the three months ended 
May 31 of $1.02 billion, or 20 cents a share, on revenue of $3.88 billion. 
Oracle's offer of INR882.62 for i-flex's public shares is a slight discount to the company's closing price Tuesday of 
INR896.15 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, when the shares rose 8.2%. 
Oracle's shares recently traded at $13.57, up 4 cents or 0.5%.

CIOs Navigate a Restless Sea of Mergers; Opinion: Risk-averse CIOs are more susceptible than ever to 
campaigns of fear, uncertainty and doubt. And Oracle's buying spree is making them nervous.

Jim Harding, CIO for the $4.1 billion health care company Henry Schein Inc., doesn't like taking risks with other 
people's money. Especially not the money of the people who control his salary. It's certainly fair to say that 
Harding is risk-averse, but that doesn't prevent him from considering unproven, cutting-edge technologies such as 
voice over IP. That's why I was startled when he spoke so vehemently this week about his fear of buying products 
from Oracle. 
"To make a major, multimillion-dollar decision here on a new ERP [enterprise resource planning] system, I have a 
hard time picking Oracle because I don't know where it's headed," Harding said. 
"Are we going to have to migrate? It's a very dicey world. It's much easier to pick SAP because you know what 
you're getting. Would I want to stand in front of the chairman and put our company at risk like that? Not unless I 
absolutely have to." 
Harding's comments sounded eerily similar to those I heard recently from another CIO, Neil McCarthy, who runs 
the technology operations at the $3 billion Wawa convenience-store chain. 
To read more about the Wawa CIO's perspective on making a major enterprise-software move in the middle of an 
acquisition battle, please click here. 
While Harding was trying to decide between Retek and SAP, Retek was purchased by Oracle. "Thank God we 
didn't go with Retek," he said, because of all of the changes and uncertainty that will surround Retek "for the next 
two years as Oracle tries to integrate it all in." 
Fear of Oracle because of perceived lack of product direction? This is Oracle, which for years has been seen as 
the safe choice, akin to the old "you can't be fired for choosing IBM" days. As long as a CIO could stomach Larry 
Ellison's strutting-peacock media comments, Oracle was an easy option. 
Microsoft was a control freak, and Computer Associates priced its services as though its customers were 
arch-enemies of its ancestors, but Oracle was simple. 
Oracle's sin? Ellison's appetite for buying companies, including PeopleSoft, Retek, ProfitLogic and J.D. Edwards. 
It may take a tough man to make a tender offer, but it takes an even tougher CIO to ride it out until all of those 
acquisitions are figured out, rationalized and cleaned up.

LOS ANGELES (XFN-ASIA) -- Oracle Corp. on Tuesday said it agreed to purchase privately held ProfitLogic Inc., 
further shoring up the business-software giant's offerings to the potentially lucrative and underserved retail 
segment after a recent acquisition of Retek Inc. 
Oracle , based in Redwood Shores, Calif., and ProfitLogic said they expect to close the deal, for which terms 
weren't disclosed, by the end of July. 
The acquisition follows Oracle's roughly $700 million acquisition of Minneapolis-based Retek, which also provides 
software aimed at retailers, in April. The latest deal also fits with expectations that Oracle will continue to snap up 
smaller software vendors, particularly those that specialize in specific industries, in a bid to nab market shares 
from larger rival SAP AG of Walldorf, Germany. 
Oracle also acquired smaller rival PeopleSoft Inc. for $11.1 billion earlier this year after a bitter 18-month hostile 
pursuit. 
Cambridge, Mass.-based ProfitLogic makes software used by retailers to analyze customer buying patterns in 
order to manage inventory and pricing. 
"ProfitLogic's software provides analysis that helps retailers put the right product in the right store, for the right 
customer, at the right time," said Duncan Angove, general manager of Oracle's Retek unit. 
ProfitLogic's customers include a number of well-known U.S. retailers, including Federated Department Stores 
Inc.'s Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. 
Oracle's outspoken chief executive, Larry Ellison, has emphasized that the company has no plans to make 
acquisitions that don't contribute to its long-term strategy and profit-growth targets of 20% a year over the next 
five years. 
Oracle's stock was unchanged in extended-hours trading. The shares had dipped 2 cents, or 0.2%, to close the 
regular session at $13.27.

LOS ANGELES (XFN-ASIA) -- Looks like there's a good chance we'll see more acquisitions from Larry Ellison 
this year. 
The growth rate of Oracle Corp.'s software applications business, boosted by its acquisition of PeopleSoft Inc. in 
January, surprised many when the company reported earnings on Wednesday and saw its stock pushed higher. 
But if Oracle , the top seller of corporate database software, wants to be as large a player as German giant SAP 
in the market for applications used by large corporations, Chief Executive Larry Ellison likely will need to acquire 
more companies. 
Ellison and other Oracle executives are vocal about improvements in their business at the expense of SAP. 
During a conference call to discuss his company's latest results, Oracle's chief had high praise for its applications 
segment. 
"The application quarter was terrific," Ellison asserted, referring to a 52% jump in revenue from new application 
sales. He said the company believes it is gaining market share from SAP, especially in North America and in 
industries like telecommunications and banking, for software used by human resources and other corporate 
departments. 
But if the company wants to grow enough to catch SAP, it may need to acquire that growth, according to at least 
one analyst. 
"[Oracle is] a strong No. 2 application vendor, but it is still a way back from where SAP is, and they aren't going to 
catch them with organic growth," said Jim Shepherd, a senior vice president of the Boston-based firm AMR 
Research. 
Shepherd predicted the combined Oracle-PeopleSoft will take a 19% to 20% share of total revenue in the 
applications market in calendar 2005 -- around double the share taken by the separate companies last year. 
However, the analyst puts SAP's share at 43% for the year, up from 40% last year. 
In other words, AMR predicts that SAP will grow at least as fast as the new Oracle this year, if not faster, which 
means Oracle will still lag SAP in market share. 
And that's after Ellison spent more than $10 billion to buy PeopleSoft. 
Of course, Ellison could ratchet up the hard-driving Oracle culture up yet another notch and watch his sales force 
best the Germans. 
Just as likely, though, is that Oracle will snap up other software firms in its bid for a larger share of the corporate 
applications market. Oracle executives have said as much in speeches to investors. 
Ellison's recent recruitment of Gregory Maffei, a former Microsoft Corp. executive who is seen as a sharp 
dealmaker, as Oracle's new chief financial officer further suggests the buying spree is not yet over. 
Maffei, who takes over top finance job from fellow co-president Safra Catz, was CFO at Microsoft, the world's 
largest software firm, in the late 1990s. During his tenure at Oracle's Redmond, Wash.-based rival, Maffei was 
seen as instrumental in helping shape that company's dealmaking strategy.

Page 66 of 165 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"Oracle has made a lot of efforts and had a lot of success over the last few years in the M&A space, and I agree 
with [Ellison's] belief that consolidation is a natural for the enterprise software space," Maffei told MarketWatch in 
a recent interview. 
Oracle's newest senior executive won't officially be charged with managing the acquisition strategy. But he told 
MarketWatch that, as a senior member of Oracle's management team, he expects to have input in Oracle's 
acquisition plans, with Catz continuing to drive those activities. 
Among the companies that have been mentioned as targets are Siebel Systems Inc. , BEA Systems Inc. and 
BMC Software Inc. 
Siebel, the struggling maker of customer-relationship management software, has seen its shares fluctuate wildly 
at times on talk of an Oracle takeover. To be sure, San Mateo, Calif.-based company was recently forced to put 
an employee retention plan in place to calm its nervous workers over the threat of an impending buyout. 
Siebel's current market capitalization is $4.6 billion. 
William Blair & Co. analyst Laura Lederman agreed that Oracle is likely to continuing snapping up other software 
makers. 
"We expect the company to remain acquisitive, consolidating the relatively slow-growing software market," she 
said in a recent research bulletin. 
Oracle's quarter calms short-term fears 
On Wednesday, Oracle, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., which still gets most of its revenue from selling 
databases to corporate customers, reported a strong set of quarterly results shored up by PeopleSoft's 
contribution. 
Software sales rose 24% from a year earlier, while total revenue, which includes fees from maintenance and 
service contracts, rose 25%. 
The results dispelled immediate concerns about the disruptiveness of the $10.6 billion acquisition, completed 
earlier this year after a contentious 18-month hostile pursuit and aimed at bolstering Oracle's position against 
SAP of Walldorf, Germany. 
By finally winning control of PeopleSoft, Oracle essentially doubled its share of the market for enterprise 
resource-planning software. 
Shepherd at AMR expects Oracle to continue buying companies that help boost its footing in specific industries, 
similar to its purchase in April of Retek Inc. Oracle trumped SAP in a bidding war to acquire the supplier of 
software targeted at the potentially lucrative and underserved retail industry. 
Ellison's next move could come in any number of markets, Shepherd said. 
A purchase similar in to Oracle's $670 million Retek deal makes more sense than one as large as PeopleSoft, 
according to the analyst. They are "faster to pull off and not anywhere near as disruptive to the business," he 
said. 
"It seems to me that acquisitions in light spaces, or spaces where they don't feel like that have a really 
competitive product,? are the ones that make the most sense," added Shepherd. 
What Oracle does next is up to Ellison, who said this week that "you really have to look at the applications 
business industry by industry, region by region, and see where we're strong we're getting stronger. I think that's 
extremely important." 
Oracle has remained mostly tightlipped, as would be expected, about its potential targets, but Ellison 
emphasized during the recent conference call after its results that he has "no plans to buy anything that doesn't 
contribute to our long-term strategy and profit growth targets of 20% per year over the next five years." 
"So we don't have to jeopardize those goals," he said.

earlier this year after a contentious 18-month hostile pursuit and aimed at bolstering Oracle's position against 
SAP (SAP) of Walldorf, Germany. 
By finally winning control of PeopleSoft, Oracle essentially doubled its share of the market for enterprise 
resource-planning software. 
Shepherd at AMR expects Oracle to continue buying companies that help boost its footing in specific industries, 
similar to its purchase in April of Retek Inc. Oracle trumped SAP in a bidding war to acquire the supplier of 
software targeted at the potentially lucrative and underserved retail industry. 
Ellison's next move could come in any number of markets, Shepherd said. 
A purchase similar in to Oracle's $670 million Retek deal makes more sense than one as large as PeopleSoft, 
according to the analyst. They are "faster to pull off and not anywhere near as disruptive to the business," he 
said. 
"It seems to me that acquisitions in light spaces, or spaces where they don't feel like that have a really 
competitive product,Â are the ones that make the most sense," added Shepherd. 
What Oracle does next is up to Ellison, who said this week that "you really have to look at the applications 
business industry by industry, region by region, and see where we're strong we're getting stronger. I think that's 
extremely important." 
Oracle has remained mostly tightlipped, as would be expected, about its potential targets, but Ellison 
emphasized during the recent conference call after its results that he has "no plans to buy anything that doesn't 
contribute to our long-term strategy and profit growth targets of 20% per year over the next five years." 
"So we don't have to jeopardize those goals," he said. [ 07-01-05 1326ET ]

Oracle on Friday lowered its estimated restructuring costs related to its acquisition of PeopleSoft. 
In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Oracle said that it now expects to spend 
approximately $546 million on restructuring necessitated by the PeopleSoft deal, a sizable reduction from its 
previously reported projection of $611 million in restructuring expenses. Oracle said it expects to spend an 
additional $32 million on restructuring related to its other recent acquisitions, which include retail software maker 
Retek. 
The Redwood Shores, Calif.-based firm said that it has completed a "substantial majority" of its PeopleSoft 
merger-related efforts, including the integration of the two companies' information systems and other business 
operations. Oracle reported that it expects to complete the remainder of its merger activities around the $11.1 
billion PeopleSoft buyout sometime within the next six months. 
As part of the filing, the company said that it would continue to look for strategic acquisitions that complement its 
market opportunities. On Wednesday, Chief Executive Larry Ellison said during the company's fourth-quarter 
earnings call that Oracle would consider only those acquisitions that contribute to the software maker's long-term 
strategy and profit-growth target of 20 percent per year for the next five years. 
Oracle also listed a number of remaining financial risks related to its integration of PeopleSoft, including the 
possibility of facing higher-than-expected costs in supporting the applications maker's products. Other reported 
risks include lagging PeopleSoft license renewals, and the potential departure of significant numbers of the former 
PeopleSoft's employees, Oracle said. Companies are required to list such risks as part of the SEC filing process. 
Oracle reported that the Customer Assurance Program launched by PeopleSoft during its hotly contested 
corporate takeover of the company could expose it to future lawsuits from some customers. The assurance 
program offered refunds to PeopleSoft customers if Oracle failed to meet certain product-support obligations once 
the acquisition was completed. However, Oracle said it does not believe it is likely that the company will face such 
litigation. 
As part of its fourth-quarter earnings report, which exceeded the expectations of Wall Street analysts, Oracle said 
that it has completed its efforts to merge PeopleSoft's software sales teams with its own operations. Boosted by 
sales of PeopleSoft applications, Oracle reported $3.12 billion in fourth-quarter software revenue, a 24 percent 
increase compared with the same period last year. 
The company's fourth-quarter enterprise applications license revenue jumped by 52 percent to $350 million as its 
sales teams began marketing PeopleSoft software directly alongside Oracle's existing products.

In First Full Quarter After Merger, Oracle Beats Expectations

SAN FRANCISCO, June 29 -- The Oracle Corporation, the software company, reported on Wednesday 
fourth-quarter profits that were slightly higher than expected, even as it completed its integration with PeopleSoft, 
the rival software company it acquired in December. 
While the company had strong growth in its flagship database business, Oracle also showed surprisingly brisk 
sales of application software, which is used to automate business tasks, with sales surpassing Wall Street's 
expectations. 
''We thought the quarter was fantastic, considering how much we had going on,'' Charles E. Phillips, Oracle's 
co-president, said in an interview. ''To have both the application and infrastructure businesses accelerate,'' he 
said, is an indication that the acquisition of PeopleSoft is ''helping our entire business.'' 
Oracle's profits rose 3 percent to $1.02 billion, or 20 cents a share, from $990 million a year earlier, or 19 cents a 
share. Total revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended May 31, increased to $3.88 billion from $3.08 
billion a year ago. 
Looking ahead, the company said it would have continued strong performance. It expects to earn 14 cents a 
share in the current quarter, compared with 10 cents a share a year ago. For fiscal 2006, which ends next May, 
the company raised its revenue estimate to $14.2 billion to $14.4 billion, and raised its earnings forecast to 78 
cents to 81 cents a share, from its earlier forecast of 64 cents to 65 cents a share. 
The fourth quarter was the first full quarter since Oracle's $10.3 billion acquisition of PeopleSoft. Excluding certain 
expenses, including costs related to integrating PeopleSoft's sales force with Oracle's, the company reported 
adjusted earnings of $1.36 billion, or 26 cents a share, up from 19 cents a share in the same quarter last year; the 
figure was 3 cents higher than analysts' expectations. 
In addressing widespread speculation about Oracle's making another big acquisition, Lawrence J. Ellison, 
Oracle's chief executive, told analysts on a conference call Wednesday that the company would carefully evaluate 
future acquisitions for their effects on Oracle's plans for growth, giving no specifics about possible takeover 
targets. 
In March, Oracle won a bidding war with SAP, the German software giant, to acquire Retek, which makes 
software to help retail chains manage their operations. The price was $631 million for Retek, which had sales of 
$174.2 million last year. 
Mr. Ellison said, ''We have no plans to buy anything that doesn't contribute to our long-term strategy and profit 
margins of 20 percent per year over the next five years.'' 
The company's software sales in the fourth quarter climbed 24 percent, to $3.12 billion, from $2.52 billion for the 
period a year ago. New license revenue for database programs grew 16 percent, to $1.26 billion, while new 
license revenue for applications software jumped 52 percent, to $350 million. 
''This is the first quarter in a while where we've had both good database and good application growth,'' said David 
M. Hilal, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, who has a buy rating on Oracle. ''That was nice to see for a 
change.''

Safra A. Catz, Oracle's co-president and interim chief finance officer, said the absorption of PeopleSoft's business 
was now complete. Oracle's work force is now nearly 50,000 employees, up from roughly 45,000 before the 
merger. 
Last week, the company, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., announced it had hired Gregory B. Maffei, a former 
Microsoft executive known for aggressive deal making, as Oracle's chief finance officer and co-president. That 
hiring led some analysts to speculate that Oracle was interested in seeking new acquisitions in the near term. 
Oracle's earnings report was issued before the market opened. Shares in Oracle rose 74 cents to close at $13.57 
on Wednesday.

Oracle CEO: Acquisitions Integral To Growth Strategy 
Oracle CEO: Acquisitions Integral To Growth Strategy

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Oracle Corp. (ORCL) Chief Executive Larry Ellison said Wednesday the company 
would need to make acquisitions in order to achieve a 20% annual earnings growth target. 
Ellison, speaking at the offices of The Wall Street Journal, added that the company would be able to achieve 
organic growth in the "mid-teens" without acquisitions. 
"We are going to have to do some special acquisitions to meet our goals," Ellison said. Ellison added that 
Oracle will seek to make acquisitions of companies that have a specialist focus similar to Retek - a retail software 
maker. Oracle purchased Retek in April for approximately $669 million after outbidding rival SAP AG (SAP) of 
Germany. 
"We are looking all over the world," Ellison said in regard to acquisitions. He noted that India and China were 
particularly attractive areas. 
Earlier Wednesday, Oracle, the world's largest database maker, reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income for the 
three months ended May 31 of $1.02 billion, or 20 cents a share, compared with $990 million, or 19 cents a 
share, in the same period the previous year. Revenue rose 26% to $3.88 billion from $3.08 billion. 
Ellison sees only a handful of software vendors surviving in the long term. He cited Oracle, IBM Corp. (IBM), 
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and SAP as the survivors. He said he sees only the bigger players surviving due to the 
advantages of economies of scale. 
In response to a question about how long he planned to stay at the helm, Ellison explained that he has cut out 
many of the duties he disliked, such as sales and marketing. He now works approximately 40 hours a week, down 
from the 80 hours he regularly put in earlier in his career. 
"I don't know how much more I can cut back, all the stuff I do now, I enjoy doing," Ellison said. "I'll still do that for 
some time to come." 
Earlier this week, Oracle hired former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Financial Officer Greg Maffei as its third 
president, creating what some believe is a three-way race to eventually succeed Ellison. Ellison, who was a key 
founding member of the software industry, is one of the last remaining in his generation who still are integral to 
day-to-day management of his company.

Siebel rises on speculation of Oracle talks - UPDATE 2

LOS ANGELES (XFN-ASIA) -- Siebel Systems Inc.'s stock gained ground Friday following a media report that the 
troubled software maker is in fresh talks with Oracle Corp. to be acquired in a deal worth up to $5 billion. San 
Mateo, Calif., Siebel's stock gained 41 cents, or 4.8%, to close at $9 on stronger-than-average volume of 50.4 
million shares. Oracle's shares moved lower by 6 cents, or 0.5%, to end at $11.56, with 41.2 million shares 
traded. Speculation surrounding a possible acquisition of Siebel by Oracle, of Redwood Shores, Calif., has long 
made the rounds on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, and some observers were quick to point out that it's unlikely 
any deal would come together in the near term. To be sure, during the antitrust trial surrounding Oracle's 
ultimately successful, hostile pursuit of rival PeopleSoft Inc. it emerged that Siebel was on Oracle's list of potential 
acquisition targets. 
According to a report in The Daily Deal that cited a source and analyst, the companies held talks about a possible 
deal within the last week. The report conceded, however, that the talks were preliminary and could still break 
down. Bert Hochfeld of Hochfeld Independent Research Group was quoted in the report as confirming the talks 
and saying, "There have been substantive, high-level discussions." However, analyst Peter Coleman at Think 
Equity Partners in San Francisco downplayed the renewed speculation, saying: "I don't really think there is 
anything to [the report]." "I'm sure they are discussing things and they probably have for years on and off," he told 
MarketWatch. High on the list of potential sticking points that could stand in the way of a merger between the two 
business software makers: the premium Oracle would be willing to pay to scoop up Siebel. "This issue has to do 
with price," Coleman at Think Equity said. While Siebel executives likely see their stock as "horribly undervalued" 
at current levels, Oracle's savvy chief executive, Larry Ellison, is unlikely to offer a massive premium to pick up a 
struggling company, according to the analyst. "I'm sure they are talking, but they're probably not on the same 
planet," Coleman asserted. Siebel, which makes software used by its customers to manage their customer 
relationships, has over $2 billion in cash on its books. Ellison and his firm would also likely face concern among 
investors if it were to engage in a large deal while still digesting the $10.6 billion PeopleSoft acquisition, 
completed early this year. Oracle also recently picked up small niche player Retek Inc. - a Minneapolis-based 
provider of software to the retail industry - in a deal worth around $631 million. A Siebel spokesperson declined to 
comment, citing the company's policy of not addressing rumors or speculation. An Oracle spokeswoman declined 
to comment. Siebel has faced increasing pressure from investors and analysts to come up with a strategy to 
reenergize itself against increasing competitive pressures and boost its lagging share price. Some investors have 
recently gone as far as calling for the company to put itself on the block to unlock shareholder value. Indeed, 
Siebel's stock, which soared above $100 a share during the 1990s boom, is a mere fraction of its former self. As 
of the prior close, the stock was down 18% for the year so far, and has traded in a range of $6.97 to $11. 50 over 
the past 52 weeks. The company faces intense pressure from smaller, agile players like Salesforce.com Inc. at 
one end of the market, and giants like Oracle and Walldorf, Germany-based SAP AG that provide a suite of 
products at the higher-end. Earlier this week, Siebel fell into a quarterly loss as overall revenue sank and license 
revenue for its applications plummeted nearly 41%. License revenue is a key measure of business strength at 
corporate software companies. The chief executive at the time, Michael Lawrie, had given prior warning of the 
weak results, blaming poor execution and "clearly softer" demand. Barely a week after the company issued the 
dismal outlook, Siebel ousted Lawrie and replaced him with longtime board member George Shaheen, who now 
faces the daunting challenge of turning the software firm around. Shaheen has promised immediate steps to 
improve the company's operating and financial performance. Investors and analysts will be keenly listening for 
details on his turnaround plan at the company's meeting with financial analysts scheduled for Thursday in New 
York. This story was supplied by MarketWatch. For further information see www. marketwatch.com. MMMM

SAP Says Taking Share From Oracle, No Merger Plans; SAP AG, Europe's biggest software company, 
said it is taking market share away from rival Oracle Corp. in the key U.S. business software market and 
denied SAP was considering a merger with Oracle.

PALO ALTO, Calif. (Reuters)-SAP AG, Europe's biggest software company, said Thursday it is taking market 
share away from rival Oracle Corp. in the key U.S. business software market and denied SAP was considering a 
merger with Oracle. "We are gaining market share," said SAP chief executive Henning Kagermann, referring to 
Oracle, the world's biggest database maker and top rival to SAP, market leader in software applications that 
automate and run business processes like payroll and customer relations. 
"Believe me, it is going up," said Kagermann about SAP's market share. He said more details of SAP's 
performance would follow when SAP reports its first quarter earnings next Thursday. 
Kagermann and other top SAP executives met with reporters at the company's California offices, where they have 
been talking to customers, venture capitalists and employees. Kagermann made his remarks about SAP's market 
share to a group of reporters after the event. 
The U.S. business software market-where Oracle says it dominates in software applications-is SAP's 
fastest-growing market and brings in about one-third of all revenues at the Walldorf, Germany-based company. 
Kagermann said SAP, which also denied market rumors Thursday that it was going to preannounce its quarterly 
results, was neither in merger talks with Oracle nor considering such a deal. 
In a recent interview with German business weekly Wirtschaftswoche, Kagermann said he would listen if Oracle 
Chief Executive Larry Ellison called to suggest a merger. 
On Thursday he firmly said that as CEO it was his duty to shareholders to take any phone call related to mergers. 
"I am a polite man. I would answer any call. As a CEO you have to listen. I have to listen," he said, adding that he 
was not considering a deal. 
SEEKING DEALS THAT FILL GAPS 
Kagermann, a physicist and mathematician who joined SAP in 1982, said SAP was still on the outlook for 
acquisitions to fill holes in the company's product portfolio, which targets around 25 different industries ranging 
from banking to oil and gas. 
SAP, which has bought 13 relatively small software makers since 2001, attempted to buy small U.S. retail maker 
Retek Inc. in March but was outbid by Oracle, which purchased the company for around $670 million. 
"We have indicated where our portfolio is not complete," said Kagermann, citing industry segments-sometimes 
called verticals-like financial services and the public sector. 
Kagermann said SAP had no desire to buy embattled software maker Siebel Systems Inc., saying Siebel's 
products had too much overlap with SAP's. Siebel ousted its CEO on Wednesday because of the company's 
underperformance. 
Leo Apotheker, an SAP board member who heads the company's global operations, rejected suggestions by an 
Oracle executive that SAP would "use price as a mechanism to compete" with Oracle. The Oracle executive 
made the comments in an interview with Reuters.

Page 77 of 165 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"We have no intention of doing that," said Apotheker about whether SAP would lower its prices in Asia. 
Determining whether SAP or Oracle holds the top spot in the U.S. business software market is difficult because 
each company uses different metrics to account for software deals, said Bruce Richardson, an analyst at industry 
group AMR Research. 
But the battle for that top position is part of the bragging rights SAP and Oracle each want in their wider struggle 
to dominate computing technology in the years ahead. 
Database Editor Lisa Vaas says the idea of SAP being interested in merging with Oracle is whacky. To read 
more, click here. 
Oracle and SAP, along with International Business Machines Corp. and Microsoft Corp. , are competing in each 
other's traditional sectors as profit opportunities shrink and the companies look for new growth. 
SAP has been the market leader in business software for decades, but is being challenged by Oracle and 
Microsoft.

Oracle, which is based in Redwood Shores, Calif., acquired rival PeopleSoft Inc. for $10.6 billion US. It more 
recently outbid SAP for retail software specialist Retek, which is based in Minneapolis. 
Kagermann told the magazine that SAP is also looking at new acquisitions, but didn't cite any specific companies. 
Shares of SAP fell 0.5 per cent to $153.64 US in Frankfurt trading. Oracle shares rose seven cents to $12.33 in

PALO ALTO, Calif., April 14 (Reuters) - SAP AG, Europe's biggest software company, said on Thursday it is 
taking market share away from rival Oracle Corp. in the key U.S. business software market and denied SAP was 
considering a merger with Oracle. 
"We are gaining market share," said SAP chief executive Henning Kagermann, referring to Oracle, the world's 
biggest database maker and top rival to SAP, market leader in software applications that automate and run 
business processes like payroll and customer relations. 
"Believe me, it is going up," said Kagermann about SAP's market share. He said more details of SAP's 
performance would follow when SAP reports its first quarter earnings next Thursday. 
Kagermann and other top SAP executives met with reporters at the company's California offices, where they have 
been talking to customers, venture capitalists and employees. Kagermann made his remarks about SAP's market 
share to a group of reporters after the event. 
The U.S. business software market - where Oracle says it dominates in software applications - is SAP's 
fastest-growing market and brings in about one-third of all revenues at the Walldorf, Germany-based company. 
Kagermann said SAP, which also denied market rumors Thursday that it was going to preannounce its quarterly 
results, was neither in merger talks with Oracle nor considering such a deal. 
In a recent interview with German business weekly Wirtschaftswoche, Kagermann said he would listen if Oracle 
Chief Executive Larry Ellison called to suggest a merger. 
On Thursday he firmly said that as CEO it was his duty to shareholders to take any phone call related to mergers. 
"I am a polite man. I would answer any call. As a CEO you have to listen. I have to listen," he said, adding that he 
was not considering a deal. 
SEEKING DEALS THAT FILL GAPS 
Kagermann, a physicist and mathematician who joined SAP in 1982, said SAP was still on the outlook for 
acquisitions to fill holes in the company's product portfolio, which targets around 25 different industries ranging 
from banking to oil and gas. 
SAP, which has bought 13 relatively small software makers since 2001, attempted to buy small U.S. retail maker 
Retek Inc. in March but was outbid by Oracle, which purchased the company for around $670 million. 
"We have indicated where our portfolio is not complete," said Kagermann, citing industry segments - sometimes 
called verticals - like financial services and the public sector. 
Kagermann said SAP had no desire to buy embattled software maker Siebel Systems Inc., saying Siebel's 
products had too much overlap with SAP's. Siebel ousted its CEO on Wednesday because of the company's 
underperformance. 
Leo Apotheker, an SAP board member who heads the company's global operations, rejected suggestions by an 
Oracle executive that SAP would "use price as a mechanism to compete" with Oracle. The Oracle executive 
made the comments in an interview with Reuters.

"We have no intention of doing that," said Apotheker about whether SAP would lower its prices in Asia. 
Determining whether SAP or Oracle holds the top spot in the U.S. business software market is difficult because 
each company uses different metrics to account for software deals, said Bruce Richardson, an analyst at industry 
group AMR Research. 
But the battle for that top position is part of the bragging rights SAP and Oracle each want in their wider struggle 
to dominate computing technology in the years ahead. 
Oracle and SAP, along with International Business Machines Corp. and Microsoft Corp., are competing in each 
other's traditional sectors as profit opportunities shrink and the companies look for new growth. 
SAP has been the market leader in business software for decades, but is being challenged by Oracle and 
Microsoft.

FRANKFURT, April 14 (Reuters) - SAP (SAPG.DE), the world's biggest maker of business software, would 
consider a merger with arch rival Oracle (ORCL.O) if its Chief Executive Larry Ellison were to suggest it, a 
German magazine reported on Thursday. 
"Why should I hang up? I would listen to him," SAP CEO Henning Kagermann said in an interview with 
Wirtschaftswoche business weekly. "Independence is not an end in itself." 
Kagermann said executives had a duty to consider whether any merger proposal might be in the best interests of 
staff and shareholders, as SAP did when Microsoft (MSFT.O) considered buying the German software giant last 
year. 
"But some combinations are harder to imagine than others," he said. 
Kagermann criticised the management of U.S. software company PeopleSoft, which fought a hard and ultimately 
unsuccessful battle to maintain its independence last year. PeopleSoft was bought by Oracle for $10.6 billion in 
January. 
"In the end, a manager isn't put in charge of a company in order to go on his own ego trip," he said. 
Kagermann said SAP was still seeking acquisitions to add to its portfolio of specialist software for particular 
industries, or to gain technical know-how, despite being beaten by Oracle in a bidding war for U.S. retail software 
specialist Retek. 
And he denied he had entered the fray in order to force Oracle to raise its bid. "That wouldn't be SAP's style. We 
were serious about buying Retek. But when the price was no longer right we stopped pursuing it," he said. 
Kagermann said, however, that innovation was the key to success, not consolidation and takeovers. 
"That's exactly the Oracle story, and I consider it to be wrong. The market will continue to be defined by 
innovations. But that doesn't rule out acquisitions in order to round out one's own product portfolio," he said.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - The chief executive of SAP AG, the world's biggest maker of business software, 
told a German business magazine he'd be open to a merger with rival Oracle Corp. if company head Larry 
Ellison were to raise the idea. 
"I would listen to him," SAP CEO Henning Kagermann told German business weekly Wirtschaftswoche, published 
Thursday. 
In a statement issued late Thursday, the Walldorf-based company said Kagermann's remarks had been taken 
out-of-context and dismissed the notion of joining forces with its fierce rival. "SAP is not in merger talks with 
Oracle, and there is absolutely no substance to this situation other than media speculation," the company said. 
Oracle spokesman Bob Wynne declined to comment Thursday. 
Kagermann said his company's executives would consider any merger proposal, provided it was in the best 
interest of the software maker's shareholders, something a German company is required by law to do. 
Oracle and SAP are the world's two leading makers of business applications software -- the computer coding that 
automates a wide range of administrative tasks. SAP has long been the industry leader, but Oracle has recently 
been closing the gap with several high-profile acquisitions. 
Oracle, which is based in Redwood Shores, Calif., acquired rival PeopleSoft Inc. for $10.6 billion. It more recently 
outbid SAP for retail software specialist Retek, which is based in Minneapolis. 
Kagermann told the magazine that SAP is also looking at new acquisitions, but didn't cite any specific companies. 
U.S.-traded shares of SAP fell 51 cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $37.94 in Thursday trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange, while Oracle shares slipped 17 cents, or 1.4 percent, to close at $12.09 on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market.

Computer software company Oracle is acquiring a Minneapolis maker of retail management software. Redwood 
Shores-based Oracle agreed on March 22 to pay $11.25 per share, or roughly $630 million for Retek. Oracle beat 
out German business software maker SAP AG in the bidding for Retek with a bid that was 25 cents per share 
higher than SAP's. "SAP has dropped out of the bidding," Oracle said. "We believe that Oracle's offer is a good 
deal for Retek stockholders, and all directors in attendance at our board meeting have recommended that it be 
accepted," said Marty Leestma, president and CEO of Retek, in a written statement. "We will work with Oracle 
over the next several weeks to ensure that the integration is not disruptive for our clients and employees." 
"Oracle has the largest applications business in North America, and we intend to expand that leadership position," 
said Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, in a written statement. "Combining Oracle with Retek is an important step in that 
direction, and it strengthens our position in the retail applications market globally." 
Oracle and Retek have had a business relationship since Retek was founded in 1986, Oracle noted. Retek's 
products have been developed on Oracle's technology platform using Oracle's development tools. Nearly 80 
percent of Retek's customers run their Retek applications on the Oracle database, Oracle said. 
As of late summer, Oracle had approximately 475 Rocklin employees out of a total work force of 40,650 at that 
time. The company did not report its employee roster tally for the Business Journal's March 11 Top 25 list of 
largest Placer County employers.

LOS ANGELES (XFN-ASIA) -- Oracle Corp. said early Wednesday that it now controls Retek Inc. after 83% of 
shares in the provider of software to the retail industry were tendered in its sweetened offer of $11.25 a share, 
setting the stage for the deal to close next week. Along the with 9.8% stake in the Minneapolis-based company 
Oracle previously had acquired, the corporate software giant now controls 92.8% of Retek's outstanding stock . 
Oracle, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., also said it would appoint five people to Retek's eight-member board 
while the purchase, worth around $670 million in total, is pending. Retek shareholders tendered 47.7 million 
shares during the offering period, which ended Wednesday, according to Oracle. The latter company, led by 
outspoken Chief Executive Larry Ellison, began a second offering period at the same price that closes April 11 to 
allow remaining shareholders time to tender their holdings. Oracle may extend that deadline, however. 
Last month, Oracle beat Germany-based rival SAP AG in the bidding for Retek by sweetening its offer to $11.25 
a share -- a price SAP found too expensive. SAP's highest offer was $11 for each Retek share. Ellison has said 
the purchase of Retek was designed to help protect his firm's position in the North American market for business 
applications software. The acquisition is also aimed at boosting Oracle's position in providing software for the 
retail industry, a largely untapped and potentially lucrative segment. Retek supplies a list of prominent companies 
in the retail industry with software to help them carry out a variety of tasks, such as managing sales and tracking 
financial and inventory data. It has more than 200 customers in 20 countries, including well-known U.S. retailers 
like Best Buy , Gap and Nordstrom . Retek had revenue of $174.2 million last year and employs around 525 
people in Atlanta, London and Melbourne, Australia. The rivalry between Oracle and SAP heated up after Ellison 
in December triumphed in a bitter and hostile takeover battle that stretched 18 months to acquire PeopleSoft Inc. 
for around $10.5 billion. That deal placed Oracle second behind SAP, Europe's largest software firm, in the 
overall market for business software. Oracle's stock eased 7 cents, or 0.6%, to close at $12.38, while shares of 
Retek added 1 cent to end at $11.23 - 2 cents shy of Oracle's offer. This story was supplied by MarketWatch. For

LOS ANGELES (XFN-ASIA) - Oracle Corp. late Monday said it won final clearance from the German Cartel 
Authority for its acquisition of retail-industry software provider Retek Inc. for around $670 million and said it was 
set to complete its tender offer. Redwood Shores, Calif.-based Oracle last month beat out German rival SAP AG 
in the bidding for Retek by sweetening its offer to $11.25 a share -- a price SAP found too expensive. Oracle's 
ultimately successful bid for Retek, of Minneapolis, topped a final offer by Walldorf, Germany-based SAP of $11 a 
share that followed a bidding war between the two fierce corporate software rivals. The deal had already been 
cleared by the U.S. Department of Justice. "Our outreach to customers is already well underway and we look 
forward to completing our tender offer tomorrow evening," Oracle President Charles Phillips said. 
Larry Ellison, Oracle's outspoken chief executive, earlier said the purchase or Retek was designed to help 
protect his firm's position in the North American market for business applications software. The acquisition is also 
aimed at boosting Oracle's position in providing software for the retail industry -- a largely untapped and

One of the riveting things about Oracle boss Larry Ellison is his flair for verbally skewering his foes in public. 
For instance, Ellison likes pairing the name Bill Gates with the phrase "convicted monopolist" whenever possible. 
More recently, Ellison made a point of referring to German software rival SAP as "sap" rather than reciting each 
letter, as the company prefers. 
But Ellison's attack on SAP goes far deeper than words, as Oracle's recent acquisitions show. First, Oracle 
launched a full assault on joint rival PeopleSoft, which ended in a $10 billion hostile takeover of the company and 
one of the largest mergers ever in the software industry. Oracle quickly followed that up by arm wrestling SAP for 
ownership of Retek, paying more than $600 million for the company--about twice its market value before the bids 
started rolling in. 
News.context 
What's new: 
Oracle has been gobbling up companies left and right in its efforts to overtake SAP in the market for enterprise 
applications software. 
Bottom line: 
If Larry Ellison can pull it off, the buyout strategy has the potential to not only reshape his company but the entire 
industry. Specifically, it could legitimize mergers in a culture that tends to shun all things "not invented here," or 
"NIH" in Silicon Valley parlance. 
More stories on Oracle 
Oracle's buying spree is uncharacteristic and an about-face for Ellison, who once declared that the sure sign of a 
struggling software company is that it starts writing checks instead of software. The strategy is also aimed 
squarely at SAP, which Oracle has long sought to overtake in the market for enterprise applications software, 
programs that help companies organize accounting, staffing, sales and logistical tasks. 
After years of faltering in that $47 billion market, Oracle is charting a bold new course, analysts said. But it's risky, 
too. Big software acquisitions are rarely blazing successes. 
If Ellison can pull it off, the strategy has the potential to not only reshape his company but the entire industry, one 
analyst said. Specifically, it could legitimize mergers in a culture that tends to shun all things "not invented here," 
or "NIH" in Silicon Valley parlance. 
"It's important for Oracle and how the financial community looks at Oracle and how prospective (software) buyers 
look at Oracle," said AMR Research analyst Jim Shepherd. "It's also important for the industry, which is asking, 'Is 
Larry right? Is this the way the industry is going to develop in the future?'" 
Shopping spree 
Acquisitions are a key part of Oracle's battle plan for taking on rival SAP. Some recent buys:

Company: PeopleSoft

Company: SiteWorks Solutions 
Date: January 2004 
Price: Not announced 
Source: Company reports 
But as things stand, it's all a very big if. The road to knocking SAP off its pedestal via acquisition is littered with 
numerous wrecks. The most spectacular example is Baan. The Dutch company was a formidable foe in the 
mid-1990s, with a strong following among big manufacturing companies. A string of acquisitions punctuated by an 
accounting scandal permanently sidelined the company in the space of just a few years. 
Of course, Oracle is no Baan. It's one of the most profitable and respected companies in software, with enormous 
resources and a globally recognized brand. 
Oracle is also buoyed by its highly successful database management software business, which continues to grow 
at a double-digit clip despite inroads by IBM and Microsoft. It's still Oracle's money engine, accounting for about 
three-quarters of overall revenue. So even if the applications effort fizzles, Oracle won't be in immediate peril, 
analysts said. 
So why, then, does Oracle bother? For one thing, it wants to diversify its business beyond database software, 
where competition and open-source programs are increasing threats. 
For another, business applications are a much bigger commitment for an IT buyer than are databases and other 
underlying technology. Business applications can have an immediate impact on workers and their productivity 
and are hard to replace once they're in. For that reason, the selection of an applications package can take months 
or years and often involves the top officers of a company. This gives suppliers considerable influence for years. 
"If you really want to capture the hearts and minds of the IT food chain, you have to start talking about 
applications, not (behind-the-scenes) technology," said Joshua Greenbaum, analyst at Enterprise Applications 
Consulting. 
But as an applications supplier, it helps to be big. SAP, the largest of the suppliers, with $9.7 billion in revenue 
last year, is forecasting 10 percent to 12 percent growth in software license sales this year. The rest of the market 
is growing revenue at about 6 percent annually. 
That's why Oracle is so bent on bulking up. The company's last great attempt in that regard was with a much 
ballyhooed redesign of its programs called 11i. But the initial release of the product was buggy, and by the time 
Oracle worked out the kinks, a global recession put a damper on information technology spending that has yet to 
fully subside. 
Now another redesign is in the works, and this one's even more ambitious. Under the code name Project Fusion, 
Oracle is combining its own software with programs from PeopleSoft, Retek and a company PeopleSoft had 
acquired called J.D. Edwards. 
It's aiming to release a new product from that effort in 2008 and hopes to blow the competition away with it. In the 
meantime, SAP and Microsoft, a newer entrant in the market, are working on next-generation versions of 
competing products that are due out around the same time.

SAP executives are quick to dismiss Oracle's strategy, saying it's likely to get bogged down. 
"You don't get more powerful by eating more," SAP Executive Board Member Shai Agassi said. "You get more 
bloated." 
An Oracle representative defended the company's position, saying the acquisitions have strengthened its work 
force, product set and research capabilities. 
And even SAP plans to pick up the pace on acquisitions. Executives say they're looking for small companies with 
interesting technology SAP doesn't already have, minimizing the chances for indigestion. 
Oracle hasn't ruled out more acquisitions either. After all, two of its highest ranking executives, Co-Presidents 
Safra Catz and Charles Phillips, are former investment bankers. 
In the short term, Oracle is likely to stick to smaller deals though, like the one it announced last week with Oblix, a 
120-person company specializing in computer-user authentication. 
Analysts also expect more Retek-like deals from Oracle. Retek was a midsize company with lots of big retail 
customers that had sought a buyer. Applications companies with a strong presence in the banking, health care, 
government or pharmaceutical industries are likely next targets, said AMR's Shepherd. 
But once things settle in the applications market, Oracle may dust off a list of heftier acquisition targets that 
became public last year during the company's fight for PeopleSoft. On it were applications players Siebel 
Systems and Lawson Software, as well as numerous IT "infrastructure" companies, including BEA Systems, 
Sybase, Business Objects and Documentum. 
Yet analysts are concerned about the law of diminishing returns. Already, Oracle is showing signs of it. The 
company's financial report last month showed that Oracle and PeopleSoft sold more software licenses as 
separate companies than they did as a combined one. 
Oracle dismissed it as a blip in the transition, and stock traders showed mercy as database sales proved healthy. 
But some analysts are doubtful. Goldman Sachs projects that Oracle's share of the applications license market 
will dwindle this year to about 20 percent, compared with 27 percent at the end of last year. Goldman has SAP 
climbing 7 percentage points over that time, to 70 percent. 
The strategy is a long-term one, however. It could even take years to prove out, ensuring that Ellison & Co. have 
their hands full for quite some time. 
"There are a lot of loose ends," Greenbaum said. "Oracle will be under the microscope for quite a while."

Oracle-PeopleSoft merger to be completed June '05 
Oracle-PeopleSoft merger to be completed June '05

Merged company now has 23,000 customers and 50,000 employees 
AMERICAN software giant Oracle Corp will complete the PeopleSoft integration by the middle of this year and 
plans to create a new set of solutions that will contain the best features of both companies' products, Oracle's 
executive vice president for Asia-Pacific and Japan, Derek Williams, said last week. 
'Overall, we have been very successful with our plan to complete the integration by the middle of this calendar 
year,' Mr Williams said in a conference call. 'Integration from an operational perspective is largely complete, and 
we expect to reap substantial benefits from these efforts going forward.' 
Globally, Oracle has retained about 75 per cent of PeopleSoft's sales, consulting, marketing and back-office 
employees, and 90 per cent of PeopleSoft's support and development staff, he said. 'We have 13,000 software 
developers worldwide now, the bulk of them in India and China,' Mr Williams said. 'Of those, 8,000 are developing 
business applications.' 
Oracle has been on an acquisition binge in the last few months. Last week, it bought closely-held Oblix Inc to 
improve the security of its database and business programs. Oblix's clients include the Chicago Board of Trade 
and Cisco Systems Inc. The purchase is Oracle's third in three months. It bought PeopleSoft in January for 
US$10.6 billion after an 18-month takeover fight. Two weeks ago, Oracle's CEO Larry Ellison won a bidding war 
with SAP AG for retail-program maker Retek Inc in a deal valued at US$643.3 million. 
Cupertino, California-based Oblix, founded in 1996, has about 100 employees, Oracle spokesman Bob Wynne 
told Bloomberg News. They will be moving to Oracle's headquarters and became Oracle employees as of last 
week, Mr Wynne said. 
Analysts estimate Oracle is the world's largest enterprise software company. It leads in enterprise applications in 
North America, and is the second-largest in the Asia-Pacific, behind SAP AG. The combined Oracle-PeopleSoft 
now has 23,000 customers and 50,000 employees globally. 
Stanley Chew, managing director of Oracle Singapore, said major local wins in its fiscal Q3-ended Feb 28 
included OCBC Bank, the Police Logistics Department, and Grocery Logistics of Singapore. Other customers 
here include Beyonics, Commerce Exchange, ECnet, GE Life, Juken Technology, National Institute of Education, 
NTUC Income, A-Bio Pharma, and Yellow Pages Singapore, Mr Chew said. 
For its fiscal Q3, Oracle reported US$425 million in revenues from the Asia-Pacific-Japan region, up 13 per cent 
year-on-year. The region accounted for 14 per cent of global revenues and 20 per cent of new license revenues 
for the quarter. 
'We're now in the most exciting phase of Oracle's development in the Asia-Pacific,' Mr Williams said. 'More than 
50 per cent of our customers in this region are SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises). According to industry 
analysts, SMEs comprise firms with 100 to 499 employees. To meet their needs, Oracle has a network of 1,500 
partners and generates over 80 per cent of its revenues in the Asia-Pacific through its partners.' 
Redwood Shores, California-based Oracle reported net income of US$540 million for its fiscal Q3, compared with 
net income of US$635 million in Q3 last year. Gross revenues rose 18 per cent to US$2.95 billion. 
CEO Larry Ellison, citing IDC Corp figures, claimed that 'solid growth in our database business enabled Oracle to 
take market share from IBM all year long'.

Enterprise software giant Oracle has claimed victory in its battle with German rival SAP to acquire enterprise retail 
applications firm Retek, after receiving clearance from the US Department of Justice and signing a definitive 
merger agreement with the software developer. 
'We have received word from the US regulatory authorities that the Oracle acquisition of Retek has received early 
termination, clearing the way for Oracle to move forward with the transaction,' said Oracle spokesman Jeff Lettes. 
The regulatory ruling in its favour came shortly after Oracle raised its cash offer to purchase all outstanding 
shares of Retek to $11.25 (£6) per share, an offer which appears to have been accepted by the company. 
The database giant has already purchased 5.5 million shares of Retek common stock, about 10 per cent of its 
shares. 
'Our North American applications business is larger than SAP's, and we intend to defend our number one 
position,' said Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison. 
'Customers have told us they want Oracle to buy Retek, and Retek's applications are built on Oracle's technology 
platform.' 
The alleged customer support for the deal is in stark contrast to the company's takeover of PeopleSoft. Despite 
efforts to appease its new customer group, many PeopleSoft and JD Edwards users remain concerned about the 
company's long-term plans for the applications it acquired, provision of support and the cost of eventual migration 
to Oracle-based solutions. 
'Regardless of whether SAP or Oracle acquires Retek, its customers will be forced into a major upgrade akin to a 
new product installation,' says a newly-released analysis by Gartner analysts Jeff Woods, Jeff Roster and Andrew 
White. 
It says that Oracle retail customers should welcome the news because it offers the prospect of a single-vendor 
system for their retail applications. 
'And this announcement is good news for Retek customers over the short term, because if SAP became the 
acquirer, Retek customers are likely to be forced to migrate quickly, while Oracle isn't likely to force customers to 
migrate until at least 2008,' say the Gartner analysts. 
Gartner advises Retek customers to halt any project that involves deploying Retek functionality on non-Oracle 
technology stacks until the outcome of the takeover attempt has become clear.

Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ: ORCL) and Retek Inc. (NASDAQ: RETK) announced that they have signed a 
definitive merger agreement under which Oracle will acquire Retek at a price of US$11.25 for each outstanding 
Retek share. SAP has dropped out of the bidding. 
"Oracle has the largest applications business in North America, and we intend to expand that leadership position," 
said Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. "Combining Oracle with Retek is an important step in that 
direction, and it strengthens our position in the retail applications market globally." 
"Most Retek customers already run Oracle's financial and human resources applications, so Oracle buying Retek 
is a perfect fit for the retail industry," said Retek customer and Best Buy CIO, Bob Willet. 
"We believe that Oracle's offer is a good deal for Retek stockholders, and all directors in attendance at our board 
meeting have recommended that it be accepted," said Marty Leestma, President and Chief Executive Officer of 
Retek. "We will work with Oracle over the next several weeks to ensure that the integration is not disruptive for 
our clients and employees." 
Oracle and Retek have enjoyed a strong partnership since Retek was founded in 1986. Retek's products have 
been developed on Oracle's technology platform using Oracle's development tools. Nearly 80 percent of Retek's 
customers run their Retek applications on the Oracle database.

PALO ALTO, Calif. (Dow Jones)--Oracle Corp. (ORCL) had hoped for a pause. But just 10 weeks after paying 
$10.3 billion for PeopleSoft Inc., the software crusader was at it again, pledging another $669 million last week for 
the small retail software maker Retek Inc. (RETK). 
'We really intended to take a rest after PeopleSoft,' Chief Executive Larry Ellison told analysts, referring to the 
18-month-long hostile takeover battle Oracle won in December. But 'we thought the retail industry was strategic 
for us, and we had to respond,' when rival SAP AG (SAP) offered to buy the company. 
At this point, 'we really don't envision doing a major acquisition until we've had a few quarters under our belt,' 
Ellison said. Then, in almost the same breath, he explained how mergers of $500 million or less are easy for a 
company of Oracle's size to digest, as if preparing the analysts for another buy, which came on Monday, when 
Oracle bought security company Oblix Inc. for an undisclosed price. 
Oracle is nothing if not determined. Throughout the long, bitter PeopleSoft tender offer, Ellison and Oracle's top 
management remained unflinchingly convinced their strategy was right, say company executives and insiders. 
Despite a legal challenge from the U.S. Department of Justice that would have derailed most mergers, Ellison 
and top M&A aide Safra Catz, an Oracle president, saw themselves on a 'mission' to complete the deal, says one 
insider who participated in meetings with both. 
Faced with a slowing market for business software, Oracle is equally unshakable in its desire to lead a round of 
consolidation and in the process remake a business unit that has less than stellar results. 
But zeal alone won't solve some of the company's intractable problems. Oracle is a leader in the lucrative 
database software business, but has underachieved in the applications programs companies use to automate 
accounting, human resources and customer relationships. Last week's mixed third-quarter results were more 
proof. Sales of database software were strong, rising 12%. Applications sales were weak. 
Oracle says PeopleSoft will change all this. The acquisition will give the company the heft to spend more on 
research and development and to take on giants International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Microsoft 
Corp. (MSFT). Part of the strategy is to sell more copies of its database and application server software to 
PeopleSoft customers, making both products more established de facto standards in the industry. Eventually, 
these programs will be tightly integrated in a unified 'stack' of applications software the way Microsoft links its 
Office products together, or its desktop and server versions of Windows. The goal is to put Oracle's 'stack' on 
equal footing to those from Microsoft, IBM and SAP. 
The merger also will lead the company to a new generation of application products - given the name Fusion - that 
will evolve over the next several years, says President Charles Phillips. Each successive update of PeopleSoft 
and Oracle software between now and 2008 will have more Fusion technology in it. This will include the major 
new version of PeopleSoft software Oracle is promising, which is likely to be called PeopleSoft 9F, for Fusion, 
says Phillips. 
The benefit of the evolutionary step to Fusion is that customers will be able to migrate their systems in gradual 
steps, rather than with a single big leap. In the meantime, Oracle hopes customers will continue paying 
high-margin maintenance, or support. So far so good, the company says. 'To my knowledge, there is no customer 
who has not renewed maintenance,' says Phillips. 
Catching Up

But Oracle has plenty of catching up to do in the $45 billion applications market. Last year, SAP extended its lead 
in the market for ERP, or enterprise resource planning, software and outgrew PeopleSoft's human resources, or 
HR, product. 
SAP pushed its share in ERP to an estimated 36.4% from 35.9% in 2003, while Oracle's rose to 19.7% from 
19.3%, says AMR Research of Boston. In HR, SAP's sales rose an estimated 12.5% in 2004 while PeopleSoft's 
rose 7.3%, AMR says. 
SAP has been quick to pounce. 'This is the worst destruction of value - not for Oracle, but for Oracle customers; 
not for PeopleSoft, but for PeopleSoft customers - in the history of computing,' says Shai Agassi, an executive 
board member at SAP. 
Agassi predicts SAP will gain market share at a faster pace in the future. 'All the SAP sales people are out there 
on a steal PeopleSoft mission,' says Gerald Cohen, chief executive of Information Builders Inc., a SAP partner. 
Hoping to keep SAP at bay, Oracle has moved swiftly to reassure PeopleSoft customers who worry their products 
have no future. Within weeks of the deal's Jan. 7 closing, the company announced a promise to support 
PeopleSoft products through 2013. For customers, 'the maximum period of uncertainty is behind,' says Phillips. 
Oracle contacts more than 2,000 PeopleSoft customers each month, and 'survey results have swung to the 
positive over the last two months, he says. 'Most see benefits' to the merger. 
Yet, many customers appear to be watching and waiting. Some have put PeopleSoft projects on hold or slowed 
down rollouts, says Judy Sweeney, a research director at AMR Research. Others have halted plans to buy new 
software modules to add to their existing systems. 
Some customers say they see potential benefits to the merger. When it comes to maintenance, 'I'm pretty 
confident we'll get the level of support we need for the life cycle of the products were on,' says Danny Peltz, an 
executive vice president at Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), which uses PeopleSoft's human resources software. 
But Peltz will let Oracle prove itself before switching to new systems. Wells will consider going to Fusion as long 
as it's simple to go from one system to the next, he says. 'As long as the products and services stay on the cutting 
edge, we'll continue to use them.' 
Hossein Eslambolchi, AT&T Corp.'s (T) chief technology officer, echoes the importance of product innovation. 
Eslambolchi uses financial applications software from Oracle and customer relationship management software 
from Siebel Systems Inc. (SEBL). Competition is alive in the market, despite the consolidation, he says. 
But a myriad of design complexities make pleasing everyone a gargantuan chore. Eslambolchi says Oracle's 
message of a unified stack of products attracts him. It is impossible for AT&T to gather all the pieces of a 
complicated system from separate vendors and smoothly integrate them, he says. 
Eric Peterson, director of information services and telecommunications at Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colo., has 
a different view. He finished installing PeopleSoft payroll on Jan. 1 and plans to stick with Oracle support. If the 
hospital gets support for five to eight years it will feel it got its money's worth. 
But Peterson says he may not go to PeopleSoft 9F. His reservation is that Oracle has indicated Fusion will only 
work with its database. Oracle argues that by closely linking the database, application server and applications it 
will be able to design features no outside vendor can duplicate, such as extra security. 
For Peterson, the reliance on the Oracle database is a showstopper. Craig Hospital works with the less powerful 
but easier to handle Microsoft SQL Server database. Peterson doesn't have enough staff to maintain a large 
Oracle database. 
Because of the product complexities, picking the winner in the stack and applications race is difficult. Oracle is 
presently behind IBM, SAP and Microsoft in producing an integrated stack, says Dale Kutnick, a senior Meta 
Group analyst who testified for Oracle in court. Meanwhile, SAP is rushing to bring out a new version of its 
applications software ahead of Oracle in 2006. 
'I think we have a couple years head start versus SAP and Oracle,' asserts James Utzschneider, a general 
manager of strategy at Microsoft. He says Microsoft's ability to integrate its business applications with Office and 
Windows will lower costs. 
Oracle is not ready to give an inch. Its executives say they remain determined.

Oracle has won the battle to acquire retail business software company Retek. Rival bidder SAP pulled out of the 
bidding after Oracle's second offer of £361m was accepted by the Retek board. 
Retek customers include Abercrombie & Fitch, Bhs, Gap, New Look, Dixons, FNAC, Ingram Micro and the US 
Postal Service. 
"Oracle has the largest applications business in North America, and we intend to expand that leadership position," 
said Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison. 
Retek user and Best Buy chief information officer Bob Willet said, "Most Retek customers already run Oracle's 
financial and human resources applications, so Oracle buying Retek is a perfect fit for the retail industry." 
Analyst group AMR Research said, "Oracle's infusion of needed resources should be viewed as a positive. 
However, Oracle has been distracted with Project Fusion [the PeopleSoft integration], and it is vital that retailers 
get a clear picture of Oracle's strategy for them immediately."

"I think we have a couple years head start versus SAP and Oracle," asserts James Utzschneider, a general

Windows will lower costs. 
Oracle is not ready to give an inch. Its executives say they remain determined.

REDWOOD SHORES, Calif. -- The merger of Minneapolis-based Retek and Oracle here creates a large new 
retail software company, but some observers questioned how retailers will take to the new entity. 
Database software giant Oracle and Retek, a supplier of retail applications software, announced last week that 
they signed a definitive merger agreement under which Oracle will acquire Retek at a price of $11.25 for each 
outstanding Retek share for a reported total of $670 million. 
The acquisition, which ended a heated bidding war with SAP, "strengthens our position in the retail applications 
market globally," said Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief executive officer. 
Bob Willet, chief information officer of Best Buy, a Retek customer, added, "Most Retek customers already run 
Oracle's financial and human resources applications, so Oracle buying Retek is a perfect fit for the retail 
industry." Nearly 80% of Retek's customers run their Retek applications on the Oracle database. 
Greg Buzek, president, IHL Consulting, Franklin, Tenn., who tracks the retail software market, noted that while 
retailers who use both Oracle and Retek applications might "get more integration" of those systems, other 
retailers "will no longer believe that Retek is database agnostic." Besides Oracle, Retek has run on NCR's 
Teradata and IBM's DB2 databases, he said. 
Buzek also predicted that there could be a backlash by retailers against large software entities like Oracle/Retek 
in favor of "smaller players that can interface to existing systems and support multiple platforms." 
Food retail customers of Retek include A&P, Kroger, Tesco and Sainsbury's.

Oracle Corp. has prevailed in its battle with SAP AG to acquire Retek Inc., a company that provides software for 
running retail stores. 
SAP, a German company whose North American headquarters is in Newtown Square, officially bowed out of the 
bidding for Minneapolis-based Retek yesterday, saying the price had gone too high. 
Redwood Shores, Calif.-based Oracle said it had reached a definitive agreement to buy Retek for $11.25 a share, 
or about $631 million. 
"As a disciplined investor, SAP established a premium price for this niche business," Henning Kagermann, chief 
executive officer of SAP, said in a statement. "However, we concluded that neither our shareholders nor retail 
customers would benefit from an auction process that would further inflate the purchase price, and in the long run, 
not deliver the returns we demand." 
SAP and Oracle had one-upped each other since February for the chance to control Retek. SAP went first with 
an $8.50 bid; it was soon followed by a $9 counteroffer from Oracle. Last week, SAP ratcheted its offer up to $11, 
and said it would stop there. Oracle chimed in shortly thereafter with its $11.25 bid. 
Retek shares traded at $6 in late February, before the bidding began. 
"Combining Oracle with Retek is an important step in that direction, and it strengthens our position in the 
retail-applications market globally," Oracle chief executive officer Larry Ellison said in a statement. 
Oracle completed a $10.3 billion acquisition of PeopleSoft earlier this year, to help it bulk up so it can remain 
competitive with SAP. 
Oracle must cover the $25 million breakup fee that Retek agreed to pay SAP in the event their engagement fell 
through. 
"That'll be something we will reinvest back into the business," said Steve Bauer, a spokesman for SAP in 
Newtown Square. 
Buying Retek, he said, would have been a way for SAP to "accelerate some of the things we're doing in the retail 
market," but he pointed out that SAP already has "2,400 customers in retail on a worldwide basis." 
While Retek is relatively small with 525 employees and $174 million in annual revenue, Oracle and SAP coveted 
its relationships with large retailers such as Best Buy. Among the features of Retek's software are Internet 
tracking of inventory. 
Also yesterday, Oracle said its fiscal third-quarter net income was $540 million, or 10 cents a share, compared 
with $635 million, or 12 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales rose to $2.95 billion from $2.51 billion in the 
period last year. Profit fell, Oracle said, because of charges related to its PeopleSoft acquisition.

Oracle Beats SAP in Bid To Buy Software Maker --- Battle for Retek Indicates U.S. Giant, German Rival

Oracle Corp. beat out German rival SAP AG in a bidding war over Retek Inc., in a sign of what is expected to 
become increasingly intense competition between the two software giants. 
Retek, a maker of software for the retail industry, agreed to be acquired by Oracle for $11.25 (8.54 euros) a 
share, or about $669 million. Oracle, of Redwood City, California, said the agreement was reached late Monday. 
While Retek, based in Minneapolis, is a relatively small company, the bidding battle highlights the heightened 
rivalry between Oracle and SAP in the market for software that helps corporations manage accounting, human 
resources and other functions. 
SAP, of Walldorf, Germany, is the world's largest maker of such business-application software. Oracle, better 
known for its database software, became the second-largest supplier of such applications with its $10.3 billion 
acquisition of PeopleSoft, which was completed in January after a bitter 18-month takeover struggle. In recent 
weeks, Oracle and SAP have been sparring over everything from which company is bigger in North America to 
the technological strengths of their respective offerings. 
Retek's chief executive, Marty Leestma, who has played the two giants against each other for months, said in a 
statement, "We believe that Oracle's offer is a good deal for Retek stockholders." 
SAP yesterday said it won't increase its offer. SAP initially bid $8.50 a share in late February. Oracle jumped in 
with a $9-a-share offer several days later. Last week, SAP raised its bid to $11 a share, only to see Oracle quickly 
counter with an $11.25 a share offer. Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison said the acquisition of Retek 
"strengthens our position in the retail applications market globally." 
Henning Kagermann, SAP's chief executive, in a statement said, "The retail industry remains strategically 
important to SAP. As a disciplined investor, SAP established a premium price for this niche business," he said. 
"However, we concluded that neither our shareholders nor retail customers would benefit from an auction process 
that would further inflate the purchase price, and in the long run, not deliver the returns we demand." 
SAP remains the dominant player in the retail industry with about 2,400 customers, said Torsten Schellscheidt, an 
analyst at WestLB AG, in a research note yesterday. Following the acquisition of Retek, Oracle will strengthen its 
retail-sector client list to about 1,000 clients. "Given the expensive character of Oracle's acquisition of Retek we 
welcome the fact that SAP dropped its bid," wrote Mr. Schellscheidt. 
The two software giants are likely to continue to knock heads as SAP continues to grow in the U.S. Indeed, some 
analysts expected SAP's strong growth to be demonstrated when Oracle reported its latest-quarter results late 
yesterday.

The bidding war for retail automation software supplier Retek ended yesterday, with Oracle scooping up the 
Minnesota firm from larger rival SAP with a US$631 million cash offer. 
Oracle and Retek said they had signed a merger agreement at a price of US$11.25 a share for all outstanding 
Retek stock. 
German software giant SAP dropped out of the bidding after making its highest and final offer of US$11 a share 
last Thursday. Oracle topped the company's bid on the same day. 
Oracle's conquest of Retek is likely to be remembered as a brief skirmish compared with its acrimonious, 
18-month battle to buy rival PeopleSoft. 
The PeopleSoft saga ended last December with Oracle agreeing to a US$10.3 billion merger with the company. 
"Oracle has the largest applications business in North America, and we intend to expand that leadership position," 
Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison said. 
"Combining Oracle with Retek is an important step in that direction, and it strengthens our position in the retail 
applications market globally." 
About 80 per cent of Retek's customers run on California-based Oracle's database and other 
business-automation software. 
The companies have worked together since Retek was founded in 1986. 
"We believe that Oracle's offer is a good deal for Retek stockholders, and all directors in attendance at our board 
meeting have recommended that it be accepted," said Retek president and chief executive Marty Leestma. 
"We will work with Oracle over the next several weeks to ensure that the integration is not disruptive for our 
clients and employees." 
By accepting Oracle's offer, Retek is expected to indemnify SAP for its trouble. Under an amended deal signed 
on March 17 for their proposed merger, SAP and Retek agreed to a US$25 million termination fee. 
A recent report from research firm Gartner said the Oracle acquisition was good news for Retek "because if SAP 
became the acquirer, Retek customers would likely be forced to migrate quickly, while Oracle isn't likely to force 
customers to migrate until at least 2008". 
Oracle's latest acquisition would also provide it with new selling opportunities to Retek's worldwide customer 
base, which is more than 200 strong and includes such prominent retailers as Tesco, Best Buy, Gap, Sainsbury's, 
Selfridges, Fnac, Lancôme and Giorgio Armani. 
Forrester Research said: "With very little product overlap, Oracle could upsell applications and platform 
technology to the common client base. 
"An integrated retail solution that includes human resources, financial systems and merchandising tools would 
help Oracle quickly become the vendor of choice for retailers."

Arics Poon, managing director of Oracle's South China and Hong Kong operations, said the Retek acquisition 
would expand the company's reach in Asia's fast-developing retail markets. 
"Retail is one of the key industries showing strong growth momentum in the region," said Mr Poon, citing fresh 
opportunities on the mainland.

ORACLE, the world's second-biggest software company, said today it had no plans to pull off any more massive 
takeovers on the scale of its recent GBP 5.6 billion acquisition of PeopleSoft. 
The group said it will stick to smaller buys - in the same vein as its just-completed GBP 334 million takeover of 
Retek - as it posted a 15 per cent drop in quarterly net profit. 
Co-founder and chief executive Larry Ellison said the slide in third-quarter profit to GBP 286m, from GBP 336m, 
was down to charges related to the December purchase of rival PeopleSoft. But that was still ahead of Wall Street 
expectations for profit to come in around the GBP 283m level. 
Nevertheless, the company raised its full-year expectations to the equivalent of 34 pence a share, from a previous 
forecast of 32.8p. "We are optimistic," Mr Ellison added. Sales at the Californian-based business were up to GBP 
1.56bn, from GBP 133m. However, that left Wall Street disappointed, as analysts had been expecting sales to 
come in at GBP 1.61bn. 
Safra Catz, Oracle's co-president and interim chief financial officer, said she expected total costs related to 
PeopleSoft to be about GBP 323m, adding that the integration should be complete by the second quarter of the 
next financial year. 
About GBP 16.4m of its third-quarter applications revenue stemmed from PeopleSoft's business, Ms Catz said. 
Oracle said license revenue, or sales of new software, in its mainstay database business rose 12 per cent to GBP 
421m in the quarter from GBP 374.5m a year ago. New sales of applications software, where Oracle competes 
closest with German rival SAP, rose nine per cent to GBP 80.5m from GBP 74m. 
Analysts said Oracle's results were generally healthy but were disappointed with the performance of Oracle's 
software applications, traditionally a small part of its business, but a primary driver behind Oracle's motivation to 
buy software makers PeopleSoft and Retek. 
Tad Piper, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said: "For those concerned about the integration of PeopleSoft and the 
health of Oracle's applications business, these results will not get the monkey off their back." 
Mr Piper noted the results of Oracle's applications, which automate business processes like payroll and 
accounting, would have declined by about 14 per cent from a year ago without the addition of PeopleSoft's 
software revenues. Overall, the acquisition of PeopleSoft is expected to boost Oracle's annual earnings by about 
GBP 210m. 
Oracle's co-founder and chief executive Larry Ellison dismissed market concerns that Oracle's core database 
business was losing market share, indicating his firm was snatching trade from a key rival. 
"Just the opposite is true ... we are taking market share from IBM," Mr Ellison said. 
In a recent report from market research firm IDC, Oracle's database market share rose to about 41 per cent from 
about 40 per cent.

Oracle declared victory yesterday in the three-week battle with rival SAP for Retek. It agreed an Dollars 11.25 a 
share takeover of the medium-sized US software company. 
The Dollars 630m acquisition is small compared with the Dollars 10.3bn Oracle spent on PeopleSoft in January, 
but illustrates the increasingly aggressive response of Larry Ellison, chief executive, to the German group's 
inroads into the US software market. 
"Oracle has the largest applications business in North America and we intend to expand that leadership position," 
Mr Ellison said. 
Oracle has twice raised its bid for Retek. SAP, which had started the bidding on February 28 at Dollars 8.50 a 
share, yesterday confirmed that it had dropped out but reaffirmed its desire to keep growing its retail customer 
base. 
Henning Kagermann, SAP chief executive, said: "The retail industry remains strategically important to SAP. 
However, we concluded that neither our shareholders nor retail customers would benefit from an auction process 
that would further inflate the purchase price and in the long run not deliver the returns we demand." 
Retek, which is based in Minneapolis and specialises in software for the retail industry, generated sales of Dollars 
174m last year. 
David Bradshaw, an analyst at research firm Ovum, said: "Oracle will be very pleased - but it needs Retek more 
than SAP, which already has quite a strong retail solution. SAP will not be altogether disappointed, because it 
forced Oracle to pay a very high price." 
Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said they viewed Oracle's victory as a "minor setback for SAP", citing 
alternative targets such as privately held Evant. A successful Retek bid by SAP would have given it "much 
needed credibility in the US market". 
Knut Woller, an analyst at German bank HVB, agreed. "This is no major drawback for SAP. Retek would have 
contributed only about 1.6 per cent to SAP's revenues in 2005 and 2006. SAP has other options to enhance its 
retail solution." 
Torsten Schellscheidt, an analyst at German bank West LB, said Oracle would strengthen its retail sector 
presence and have about 1,000 clients. SAP remained the dominant group in this sector with about 2,400 
customers. 
Retek shares, which had risen nearly 90 per cent since the bidding war broke out, fell 25 cents to close at Dollars 
11.21 in Nasdaq trading yesterday as investors realised Oracle's bid would not be bettered. 
Oracle shares fell 16 cents to Dollars 12.49. SAP rose 30 cents to Euros 120.80 in Frankfurt.

Oracle yesterday declared victory in the three-week battle with its arch-rival SAP for Retek, a mid-size US 
software company, after agreeing an Dollars 11.25 per share takeover deal that SAP declined to top. 
The Dollars 630m acquisition of Retek is small in comparison to the Dollars 10.3bn Oracle spent on PeopleSoft in

inroads into the US software market. "Oracle has the largest applications business in North America and we 
intend to expand that leadership position," Mr Ellison said. 
Oracle, which twice outbid SAP's offers for Retek, responded within hours last week to the German group's 
sweetened offer of Dollars 11 - from Dollars 8.50 - with the Dollars 11.25 that was finally accepted. 
SAP yesterday confirmed it had dropped out of the bidding and reaffirmed its desire to keep increasing its retail 
customer base. "The retail industry remains strategically important to SAP," said Henning Kagermann, chief 
executive. "However, we concluded that neither our shareholders nor retail customers would benefit from an 
auction process that would further inflate the purchase price, and in the long run not deliver the returns we 
demand." 
Minneapolis-based Retek, a specialist catering to the retail industry, generated sales of Dollars 174m last year. 
Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said they viewed Oracle's victory, which would have given SAP 
"much needed credibility in the US market", as a "minor setback for SAP", citing alternative targets such as 
privately-held Evant. 
"This is no major drawback for SAP," agreed Knut Woller at HVB Group. "Retek would have contributed only 
about 1.6 per cent to SAP's revenues in 2005 and 2006. SAP has other options (organically or via acquisitions) to 
enhance its retail solution." 
Following its acquisition of Retek, Oracle will strengthen its presence in the retail sector, and have about 1,000 
clients, said Torsten Schellscheidt, analyst at West LB. SAP remains the dominant player with about 2,400 
customers. 
Retek shares, which had risen nearly 90 per cent since the bidding war broke out, fell 27 cents to Dollars 11.19 in 
early Nasdaq trading yesterday as investors realised Oracle's bid would not be bettered. Oracle shares were 
unchanged at Dollars 12.65 and SAP rose 5 cents to Euros 120.35 in Frankfurt.

Oracle Corp., the world's third- largest software maker, won the takeover battle for Retek Inc. with a 
US$643.3-million bid, beating SAP AG and giving Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison a second victory in four 
months. 
Oracle raised its bid to US$11.25 a share March 17, topping an US$11 offer from SAP that Retek's board had 
accepted earlier that day. SAP has dropped out of the running, Retek and Redwood City, Calif.-based Oracle 
said yesterday. SAP confirmed Retek terminated the earlier agreement. 
Mr. Ellison's victory, which follows the US$10.3-billion acquisition of PeopleSoft Inc. in January, will help him 
maintain Oracle's No. 1 rank in North American sales of programs that run business tasks such as payroll and 
human resources. Minneapolis- based Retek improves Oracle's position with retailers, which are buying more 
software to manage supplies and track demand. 
"This is a rare opportunity for Oracle to strengthen its foothold in the retail arena," said UBS AG's Heather Bellini, 
the No. 3 software analyst in an Institutional Investor survey. Ms. Bellini, in New York, recommends buying Oracle 
shares and doesn't own them. 
Retek, with 525 employees and more than 200 customers in 20 countries, had sales of US$174.2-million last 
year. Clients include Tesco PLC, the U.K.'s biggest supermarket operator, and No. 1 U.S. electronics seller Best 
Buy Co. 
Shares of Retek fell US25 cents to US$11.21 in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. They had risen above 
Oracle's bid as investors bet on a higher offer from SAP. Retek has gained 87% since the day before SAP's first 
US$496-million bid Feb. 28. 
Oracle shares fell US16 cents to US$12.49. 
The buyout may cost more than Retek is worth, and Mr. Ellison's determination raises concern he has a "lack of 
discipline" about pursuing deals only at a price that is good for Oracle investors, said Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. 
analyst Charles Di Bona, the No. 2 software analyst. 
"Despite the seeming strategic fit of Retek, Oracle has shown no ability to walk away from a deal as either the 
economics or operational risk-rewards of an acquisition deteriorated," Mr. Di Bona said in a March 18 note.

''Neither our shareholders nor retail customers would benefit from an auction process that would further inflate the 
purchase price,'' says the chief executive of SAP. 
Oracle Corp. chief executive officer Larry Ellison announced Tuesday that his enterprise software firm will 
acquire retail-management software maker Retek Inc. for $11.25 per share. Oracle beat out arch-rival SAP, 
which had offered $11 per share. 
"Oracle has the largest applications business in North America, and we intend to expand that leadership position," 
said Ellison in a statement. "Combining Oracle with Retek is an important step in that direction, and it 
strengthens our position in the retail applications market globally." Walldorf, Germany-based SAP is the world's 
largest maker of business applications software. 
"We believe that Oracle's offer is a good deal for Retek stockholders, and all directors in attendance at our board 
meeting have recommended that it be accepted," said Marty Leestma, the company's president and CEO, in a 
statement. 
In prepared remarks, SAP chief executive Henning Kagermann stated that his company intends to exercise 
financial discipline in merger-and-acquisition transactions. "Neither our shareholders nor retail customers would 
benefit from an auction process that would further inflate the purchase price, and in the long run, not deliver the 
returns we demand," said Kagermann. 
Earlier this month, Retek had agreed to be acquired by SAP for $8.50 per share before Oracle first launched its 
hostile bid. 
The deal is one of several tech-related transactions in the news this week. 
On Monday, IAC/InterActiveCorp., whose chairman and CEO is legendary media mogul Barry Diller, announced it 
would buy Internet search company Ask Jeeves in an all-stock deal valued at $1.85 billion. 
And yesterday, a group of blue-chip buyout firms closed in on the purchase of SunGard Data Systems Inc., which 
provides software and processing services, for more than $10.5 billion, according to press reports. The firms 
reportedly include Silver Lake Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Bain Capital, Texas Pacific Group, 
Blackstone Group, Carlyle Group, and Thomas H. Lee Partners.

Oracle Corp. beat out German rival SAP AG in a bidding war over Retek Inc., in a sign of what is expected to 
become increasingly intense competition between the two software giants. 
Retek, a maker of software for the retail industry, agreed to be acquired by Oracle for $11.25 a share, or about 
$669 million. Oracle, of Redwood City, California, said the agreement was reached late Monday. 
While Retek, based in Minneapolis, is a relatively small company, the bidding battle highlights the heightened 
rivalry between Oracle and SAP in the market for software that helps corporations manage accounting, human 
resources and other functions. 
SAP, of Walldorf, Germany, is the world's largest maker of such business-application software. Oracle, better 
known for its database software, became the second-largest supplier of such applications with its $10.3 billion 
acquisition of PeopleSoft, which was completed in January after a bitter 18-month takeover struggle. In recent 
weeks, Oracle and SAP have been sparring over everything from which company is bigger in North America to 
the technological strengths of their respective offerings. 
Retek's chief executive, Marty Leestma, who has played the two giants against each other for months, said in a 
statement, "We believe that Oracle's offer is a good deal for Retek stockholders." 
SAP yesterday said it won't increase its offer. SAP initially bid $8.50 a share in late February. Oracle jumped in 
with a $9-a-share offer several days later. Last week, SAP raised its bid to $11 a share, only to see Oracle quickly 
counter with an $11.25 a share offer. Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison said the acquisition of Retek 
"strengthens our position in the retail applications market globally." 
"The retail industry remains strategically important to SAP," said Henning Kagermann, SAP's chief executive, in a 
statement. "As a disciplined investor, SAP established a premium price for this niche business. However, we 
concluded that neither our shareholders nor retail customers would benefit from an auction process that would 
further inflate the purchase price, and in the long run, not deliver the returns we demand." 
SAP remains the dominant player in the retail industry with about 2,400 customers, said Torsten Schellscheidt, an 
analyst at WestLB AG, in a research note yesterday. Following the acquisition of Retek, Oracle will strengthen its 
retail sector client list to about 1,000 clients. "Given the expensive character of Oracle's acquisition of Retek we 
welcome the fact that SAP dropped its bid," wrote Mr. Schellscheidt. 
The two software giants are likely to continue to knock heads as SAP continues to grow in the U.S. Indeed, some 
analysts expect SAP's strong growth to be demonstrated when Oracle reports its latest-quarter results late 
Tuesday. Oracle has said its strategy is to "surround" SAP by acquiring software companies with expertise in 
niches where the German company wants to expand. Analysts say SAP has been growing faster in the U.S. 
Retek, founded in 1986, reported 2004 net income of $8.2 million, or 14 cents a share, on revenue of $174.2 
million. The results represented a turnaround from 2003, when Retek had a loss of $20.5 million, or 38 cents a 
share, on revenue of $168 million. 
With the bidding war over, Retek slipped 2.4% to $11.19 in opening trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market 
yesterday. On the New York Stock Exchange, SAP's American depositary receipts rose one cent each to $39.69, 
while Oracle fell six cents to $12.59.

REDWOOD SHORES, Calif. (AP) - Business software maker Oracle Corp. beat out German rival SAP AG in its 
bid to buy Retek Inc., reaching an agreement to purchase the retail software maker for about $670 million, Oracle 
said Tuesday. 
Redwood Shores-based Oracle said in a news release that its offer of $11.25 per share was accepted and that 
SAP dropped out of the bidding. Retek shares, which had risen above the agreed price amid the bidding contest, 
fell more than 2 percent in the wake of the announcement. 
"Oracle has the largest applications business in North America and we intend to expand that leadership position," 
Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said in a statement. "Combining Oracle with Retek is an important step in that 
direction, and it strengthens our position in the retail applications market globally." 
In Germany, SAP characterized itself as "a disciplined investor" that chose not to increase its bid. 
"We concluded that neither our shareholders nor retail customers would benefit from an auction process that 
would further inflate the purchase price, and in the long run, not deliver the returns we demand," SAP chief 
executive Henning Kagermann said in a statement. 
SAP thought it had reached a deal to buy Minneapolis-based Retek for $8.50 per share late last month before 
Oracle topped the offer, starting a bidding war. 
"We believe that Oracle's offer is a good deal for Retek stockholders, and all directors in attendance at our board 
meeting have recommended that it be accepted," said Marty Leestma, President and Chief Executive Officer of 
Retek. "We will work with Oracle over the next several weeks to ensure that the integration is not disruptive for 
our clients and employees." 
Kagermann said SAP would use the deal's termination fee of $25 million to develop its own retail software 
platform. 
"I think it is fair for our customers as well as our shareholders to invest that money in further developing our own 
software platform," Kagermann said during a conference call. 
Kagermann also sought to dismiss suggestions that the Retek battle was a prelude to a larger-scale fight with 
Oracle. 
"I don't think there is a battle," he said. 
The gamesmanship pitted the world's two leading makers of business applications software -- the computer 
coding that automates a wide range of administrative tasks. SAP has long been the industry leader, but Oracle 
closed the gap two months ago by buying PeopleSoft Inc. for $10.3 billion after a heated battle that dragged on 
for 18 months. 
With just $174 million in annual revenue and 525 employees, Retek is a niche player in the industry. 
Nevertheless, the company holds tremendous appeal for both SAP and Oracle because its 200 customers are 
retailers -- a group that hasn't bought as much business applications software as many other industries. 
"Most Retek customers already run Oracle's financial and human resources applications, so Oracle buying Retek 
is a perfect fit for the retail industry," said Retek customer and Best Buy CIO, Bob Willet.

Retek's shares fell 25 cents, or 2.2 percent, to close at $11.21 in Tuesday trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Oracle shares fell 16 cents to $12.49 on the Nasdaq. 
SAP shares rose 0.6 percent to close at 120.74 euros ($159.04) on the Frankfurt exchange.

LONDON -- Oracle Corp. said it reached an agreement to acquire Retek, Inc. for $11.25 a share after German 
rival SAP found the price tag too expensive. The bidding battle between the software industry's current 
consuming rivalry fuelled a 91 percent rally in Retek shares in just over a month. Retek shares dropped 2.2 
percent to close at $11.21 on Tuesday. Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison said the acquisition of Retek 
"strengthens our position in the retail applications market globally." A spokesman for SAP , Europe's largest 
software group, confirmed on Tuesday the company had backed out, but declined further comment. Analysts 
polled last week by MarketWatch said they expected SAP to walk away from the deal rather than up the ante 
again. Retek on Feb. 28 agreed to a $8.50 a share takeover by SAP, which Oracle soon topped. Oracle's second 
counter, at $11.25 a share, values Retek at $631 million based on 56 million shares outstanding. 
SAP on Tuesday said it didn't believe its shareholders or customers would benefit from the auction process that 
"would further inflate the purchase price, and in the long run, not deliver the returns we demand." SAP added that 
the retail sector remains "strategically important," but noted it intends "to continue to exercise financial discipline 
in merger and acquisition transactions." Shares were last flat in Frankfurt. "We view this as a minor setback for 
SAP. Feedback from industry participants suggests it will put back SAP's North American retail ambitions by a 
couple of years," analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. SAP may look for alternative targets, the broker 
added, citing privately-held Evant as an example, to bolster its retail offering. A-list in retail Retek provides an 
A-list of customers in the retail industry with software to help them carry out a variety of tasks, such as managing 
sales and tracking financial and inventory data. It has more than 200 customers in 20 countries, including 
well-known U. S. retailers like Best Buy , Gap and Nordstrom . The retail industry is a potentially lucrative market 
for business software companies, with analysts valuing the market opportunity well above $10 billion annually. 
Retek had revenue of $174.2 million last year and employs around 525 people in Atlanta, London and Melbourne. 
Redwood Shores, Calif.-based, Oracle last Thursday trumped the second and final SAP offer at $11 a share. 
Ellison had said he wanted to acquire Retek to defend what he called his firm's leading position in the North 
American market for business application software. Retek has been an Oracle partner and customer for two 
decades. Analysts say the market opportunity is comparable with other sectors like financial services or 
manufacturing, but retailers have lagged behind in spending to align technology with the latest business 
processes. Many retailers, loath to make heavy investments in software, have traditionally built their own software 
applications, partly due to their traditionally thin margins. The companies are now realizing the need to update 
technology to keep pace as giant retailers like Wal-Mart have become a huge force across the industry. In 
December, Ellison triumphed in a bitter 18-month battle to acquire PeopleSoft Inc. for around $10.5 billion. That 
deal placed Oracle second behind its German rival in the overall market for business software. The rivalry 
between the firms has since intensified, and Oracle's latest move could hinder SAP, Europe's largest software 
concern, from gaining a stronger footing in the United States, the world's largest software market. Retek's board 
previously unanimously recommended that its shareholders accept SAP's $11 a share bid, which expires April 1 
at noon Eastern time. Under Retek's agreement with SAP, it would be forced to pay a termination fee of $25 
million, up from a previous $15 million, to walk away from the deal. Oracle would likely foot the bill for the breakup 
fee. The SAP spokesman in Walldorf declined immediate comment the break-up fee. Oracle shares closed 
Tuesday trading down 1.3 percent at $12.49. Shares of SAP closed the day down 37 cents at $39.31. This story

Oracle on Tuesday declared victory in the three-week battle with its arch-rival SAP for Retek, a mid-size US 
software company, after agreeing an $11.25 per share takeover deal that SAP declined to top. 
The $630m acquisition of Retek is small in comparison to the $10.3bn Oracle spent on PeopleSoft in January but 
illustrates chief executive Larry Ellison's increasingly aggressive response to the German company's inroads into 
the US software market. "Oracle has the largest applications business in North America and we intend to expand 
that leadership position," Mr Ellison said. 
Oracle, which twice outbid SAP's offers for Retek, responded within hours last week to the German group's 
sweetened offer of $11 from $8.50 with the $11.25 that was finally accepted. 
SAP on Tuesday confirmed it had dropped out of the bidding and reaffirmed its desire to keep increasing its retail 
customer base. "The retail industry remains strategically important to SAP," said Henning Kagermann, chief 
executive. "However, we concluded that neither our shareholders nor retail customers would benefit from an 
auction process that would further inflate the purchase price, and in the long run not deliver the returns we 
demand." 
Minneapolis-based Retek, a specialist catering to the retail industry, generated sales of $174m last year. 
Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said they viewed Oracle's victory, which would have given SAP 
"much needed credibility in the US market", as a "minor setback for SAP", citing alternative targets such as 
privately-held Evant. 
"This is no major drawback for SAP," agreed Knut Woller at HVB Group. "Retek would have contributed only 
about 1.6 per cent to SAP's revenues in 2005 and 2006. SAP has other options (organically or via acquisitions) to 
enhance its retail solution." 
Following its acquisition of Retek, Oracle will strengthen its presence in the retail sector, and have about 1,000 
clients, said Torsten Schellscheidt, analyst at West LB. SAP remains the dominant player with about 2,400 
customers. 
Retek shares, which had risen nearly 90 per cent since the bidding war broke out, fell 27 cents to $11.19 in early 
Nasdaq trading yesterday as investors realised Oracle's bid would not be bettered. Oracle shares were 
unchanged at $12.65 and SAP rose 5 cents to ?120.35 in Frankfurt.

Oracle, the US computer group, has triumphed over its German rival SAP in a month-long bidding war to acquire 
Retek, a Minneapolis-based retail software developer. Late yesterday evening Oracle announced it had agreed to 
acquire Retek for $669m (€508m).SAP initially bid $8.50 a share last month. Oracle followed with a $9-per-share 
offer a few days later. Last week Oracle increased its bid to $11.25. 
The acquisition of Retek is the latest in a series of acrimonious bidding wars between SAP and Oracle. Four 
months ago Oracle outbid SAP to purchase PeopleSoft, a software developer, in a deal valued at $10.3bn 
(€7.8bn). The PeopleSoft takeover battle ran for 18 months. 
Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison said: "Combining Oracle with Retek strengthens our position in the retail 
applications market globally." 
Shares in Oracle closed yesterday at $12.65, up 0.88%; Retek shares ended the day at $11.46, down 0.09% and

PALO ALTO, Calif. (Dow Jones)--Oracle Corp. (ORCL) posted fiscal third-quarter net income Tuesday that 
slipped 15% from a year ago to $540 million. 
But non-GAAP earnings per share of 16 cents bested Wall Street's forecast of 15 cents and suggested the 
software vendor had maintained its strong profitability. 
At the same time, however, its closely watched applications business turned in a weak performance, and Oracle 
shares dropped 19 cents, or 1.5%, in after-market trading to $12.30, according to Inet. 
Oracle said PeopleSoft Inc., which it bought for $10.6 billion January, contributed $31 million in applications 
software revenue during two months of business included in the quarter. Some analysts expected the contribution 
would be closer to $50 million. 
Meanwhile, the sale of Oracle's own applications products came to $121 million, also under expectations. 
Tad Piper, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said he had anticipated Oracle sales alone would exceed the $152 million 
combined Oracle and PeopleSoft business. "I was expecting more out of the applications business," says Piper, 
who doesn't own Oracle stock and whose firm doesn't do banking business for the company. 
For the period ended Feb. 28, Oracle said net earnings per share were 10 cents, compared with 12 cents in last 
year's third quarter. Revenue came to $2.95 billion, up 18% from $2.5 billion last year. 
Sales of Oracle's core database software rose a strong 12%, with the company's RAC version growing 38%. 
Application server sales also expanded by 33%. 
But the sales of applications software rose just 9%. Interim Chief Financial Officer and President Safra Catz said 
some disruption came as Oracle reorganized its sales force in the wake of the merger. But she insisted Oracle is 
"very, very happy with the customer response" to the combination. "I think customers are happy stability has 
come back," she said. 
On a conference call, Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison said he expected to see a "modest" effect from the 
merger on PeopleSoft's business in the fourth quarter. "They bleed the pipeline dry," he said, suggesting 
PeopleSoft's management closed every deal they could last year as they tried to fend off Oracle's takeover bid. 
"We think it will take a couple quarters to rebuild that pipeline." 
Ellison added that the company doesn't expect to make another merger this quarter. Late Monday, Oracle won a 
$669 million bid for Retek Inc. (RETK). "Our preference is not to do any major acquisitions this quarter," he said. 
But when rival SAP AG (SAP) announced a deal to buy the company in late February, "we had to respond," 
Ellison said.

PARIS (Dow Jones)--Oracle Corp. (ORCL) beat out German rival SAP AG (SAP) in a bidding war over Retek Inc.

Oracle has signed a definitive deal to acquire Retek, defeating rival SAP in the bidding war for the 
Minneapolis-based retail software maker, the database giant said late Monday. 
In a statement, Oracle said it will acquire Retek at a price of $11.25 for each outstanding Retek share. SAP, 
which had offered $11.00 per share for Retek, has dropped out of the bidding. 
"Oracle has the largest applications business in North America, and we intend to expand that leadership position," 
Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said in a statement. "Combining Oracle with Retek is an important step in that 
direction, and it strengthens our position in the retail applications market globally."

The price matches the offer Oracle made Thursday, in response to SAP's latest bid. The total value of the deal 
comes to about $650 million. 
Oracle's announcement puts an end to the bidding war for Retek. SAP had announced on Feb. 28 that it had 
reached a deal to buy Retek for $8.50 a share. Oracle responded on March 8 with a bid of $9 a share. 
However, Retek will now have to pay SAP a $25 million termination fee, because it is walking away from its 
previous definitive merger agreement with the software giant. The two companies had bumped up the fee from 
$15 million when SAP upped its bid to $11 a share. 
SAP plans to take that termination fee and reinvest it in its retail strategy, said Bill Wohl, an SAP spokesman. He 
declined to list other potential acquisition candidates in the retail market. 
Henning Kagermann, SAP chief executive, also addressed the vital role retail plays in SAP's business. 
"The retail industry remains strategically important to SAP," Kagermann said, in a statement. "As a disciplined 
investor, SAP established a premium price for this niche business. However, we concluded that neither our 
shareholders nor retail customers would benefit from an auction process that would further inflate the purchase 
price." 
Although Oracle is a longtime Retek partner and the two had held takeover talks last year, Retek's board had 
backed both SAP's original offer and its revised bid before Monday's announcement that it had reached a deal 
with Oracle. 
Retek CEO Marty Leestma said Oracle's offer represents "a good deal for Retek stockholders" and that all of the 
directors who attended a board meeting had approved the pact. Retek did not identify which director or directors 
did not attend the meeting. "We will work with Oracle over the next several weeks to ensure that the integration is 
not disruptive for our clients and employees," Leestma said in a statement. 
Oracle noted that nearly four in five Retek customers run that company's applications on top of Oracle's 
database. 
Retek has about 525 workers and had sales last year of $174.2 million.

The Retek purchase comes not long after Oracle completed a bruising battle to acquire PeopleSoft. That $10 
billion deal closed in January.

REDWOOD SHORES, California (AP) - Business software maker Oracle Corp. beat out German rival SAP AG in 
its bid to buy Retek Inc., reaching an agreement to purchase the retail software maker for about US$670 million 
(euro507.6 million), Oracle said Tuesday. 
Redwood Shores-based Oracle said in a news release that its offer of US$11.25 (euro8.52) per share was 
accepted and SAP has dropped out of the bidding. 
"Oracle has the largest applications business in North America and we intend to expand that leadership position," 
Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said in a statement. "Combining Oracle with Retek is an important step in that 
direction, and it strengthens our position in the retail applications market globally." 
In Germany, SAP characterized itself as "a disciplined investor" that chose not to increase its bid. 
"We concluded that neither our shareholders nor retail customers would benefit from an auction process that 
would further inflate the purchase price, and in the long run, not deliver the returns we demand," SAP chief 
executive Henning Kagermann said in a statement. 
SAP thought it had reached a deal to buy Minneapolis-based Retek for US$8.50 (euro6.44) per share late last 
month before Oracle topped the offer, starting a bidding war between the rivals. 
"We believe that Oracle's offer is a good deal for Retek stockholders, and all directors in attendance at our board 
meeting have recommended that it be accepted," said Marty Leestma, President and Chief Executive Officer of 
Retek. "We will work with Oracle over the next several weeks to ensure that the integration is not disruptive for 
our clients and employees." 
Kagermann said SAP would use the deal's termination fee, US$25 million (euro19 million), to develop its own 
retail software platform. 
"I think it is fair for our customers as well as our shareholders to invest that money in further developing our own 
software platform," Kagermann said during a conference call. 
Kagermann also sought to dismiss suggestions that the Retek battle was a prelude to a larger-scale fight with 
Oracle. 
"I don't think there is a battle," he said. 
The gamesmanship pitted the world's two leading makers of business applications software -- the computer 
coding that automates a wide range of administrative tasks. SAP has long been the industry leader, but Oracle 
closed the gap two months ago by buying PeopleSoft Inc. for US$10.3 billion (euro7.8 billion) after a heated battle 
that dragged on for 18 months. 
With just US$174 million (euro131.8 million) in annual revenue and 525 employees, Retek is a niche player in the 
industry. Nevertheless, the company holds tremendous appeal for both SAP and Oracle because its 200 
customers are retailers -- a group that hasn't bought as much business applications software as many other 
industries. 
"Most Retek customers already run Oracle's financial and human resources applications, so Oracle buying Retek 
is a perfect fit for the retail industry," said Retek customer and Best Buy CIO, Bob Willet.

Retek's shares fell 1 cent, or 0.09 percent, to close at US$11.46 (euro8.68) on the Nasdaq Stock Market on 
Monday, before the announcement was made. Oracle shares rose 11 cents, or 0.88 percent to close at US$12.65 
(euro9.58) Monday on the Nasdaq. 
SAP shares were flat by early afternoon on the Frankfurt exchange, trading at euro120.03 (US$158.10).

LONDON (XFN-ASIA) -- Oracle Corp. said late Monday it had reached an agreement to acquire Retek, Inc. for 
$631 million, or $11.25 a share, winning a bidding war for the maker of retail-management software after German 
rival SAP found the price too expensive. Retek shares fell 27 cents, or more than 2 percent, to $11.19 in Tuesday 
trading after SAP confirmed it would not make a third offer for the company. The month-long takeover battle 
between the software giants had fueled a 91 percent rally in Retek shares . Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison 
twice outbid his German competitors for Retek, a long-time Oracle partner whose software helps large retail 
chains manage their operations. Many retailers, loath to make heavy investments in software because of their thin 
profit margins, traditionally have built their own software applications. 
But as they look to keep pace with giant retailers like Wal-Mart , retail chains are updating their technology to 
better manage inventory. The proliferation of inventory management systems based on radio frequency 
identification, or RFID, is generating massive amounts of computer data to be stored and managed, boosting the 
market for retail software. Acquiring Retek "strengthens (Oracle's) position in the retail applications market 
globally," Ellison said in a statement. The market opportunity for retail software is comparable with other sectors 
like financial services or manufacturing and could be worth more than $10 billion annually. Ellison had said he 
wanted to acquire Retek to defend what he called his firm's leading position in the North American market for 
business application software. Some analysts say Oracle's triumph could set back SAP's plans in the North 
American market for retail software by several years. Oracle shares fell 12 cents to $12.53 in advance of its fiscal 
third-quarter earnings report, which will be released after the close of U.S. trading Tuesday. SAP shares rose 8 
cents to $39.76. SAP bows out A spokesman for SAP , Europe's largest software group, confirmed the company 
had backed out, but declined further comment. Analysts polled last week by MarketWatch said they expected 
SAP to walk away from the deal rather than up the ante again. Retek on Feb. 28 agreed to a $8.50 a share 
takeover by SAP, which Oracle soon topped. Oracle's second counter, at $11.25 a share, values Retek at $631 
million based on 56 million shares outstanding. SAP on Tuesday said it didn't believe its shareholders or 
customers would benefit from the auction process that "would further inflate the purchase price, and in the long 
run, not deliver the returns we demand." SAP added that the retail sector remains "strategically important," but 
noted it intends "to continue to exercise financial discipline in merger and acquisition transactions." Shares were 
last flat in Frankfurt. "We view this as a minor setback for SAP. Feedback from industry participants suggests it 
will put back SAP's North American retail ambitions by a couple of years," analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort 
Wasserstein. SAP may look for alternative targets, the broker added, citing privately-held Evant as an example, to 
bolster its retail offering. A-list in retail Retek provides an A-list of customers in the retail industry with software to 
help them carry out a variety of tasks, such as managing sales and tracking financial and inventory data. It has 
more than 200 customers in 20 countries, including well-known U.S. retailers like Best Buy , Gap and Nordstrom . 
Retek had revenue of $174.2 million last year and employs around 525 people in Atlanta, London and Melbourne. 
Redwood Shores, Calif.-based, Oracle last Thursday trumped the second and final SAP offer at $11 a share. In 
December, Ellison triumphed in a bitter 18-month battle to acquire PeopleSoft Inc. for around $10.5 billion. That 
deal placed Oracle second behind its German rival in the overall market for business software. The rivalry 
between the firms has since intensified, and Oracle's latest move could hinder SAP, Europe's largest software 
concern, from gaining a stronger footing in the United States, the world's largest software market. Retek's board 
previously unanimously recommended that its shareholders accept SAP's $11 a share bid, which expires April 1 
at noon Eastern time. Under Retek's agreement with SAP, it would be forced to pay a termination fee of $25 
million, up from a previous $15 million, to walk away from the deal. Oracle would likely foot the bill for the breakup 
fee. The SAP spokesman in Walldorf declined immediate comment the break-up fee. This story was supplied by

LONDON -- Oracle Corp. late Monday said it has reached an agreement to acquire Retek, Inc. for $11.25 a share 
after German rival SAP found the price tag too expensive. The bidding battle between the software industry's 
current consuming rivalry fuelled a 91 percent rally in Retek shares in just over a month. Oracle Chief Executive 
Larry Ellison said the acquisition of Retek "strengthens our position in the retail applications market globally." A 
spokesman for SAP , Europe's largest software group, confirmed the company had backed out, but declined 
further comment. Analysts polled last week by MarketWatch said they expected SAP to walk away from the deal 
rather than up the ante again. Retek on Feb. 28 agreed to a $8.50 a share takeover by SAP. Oracle's second 
counter offer, at $11.25 a share, values Retek at $631 million based on 56 million shares outstanding. 
SAP on Tuesday said it didn't believe its shareholders or customers would benefit from the auction process for 
Retek which "would further inflate the purchase price, and in the long run, not deliver the returns we demand." 
SAP added that the retail sector remains "strategically important," but noted it intends "to continue to exercise 
financial discipline in merger and acquisition transactions." Shares in Frankfurt were last flat in Frankfurt. A-list in 
retail Retek provides an A-list of customers in the retail industry with software to help them carry out a variety of 
tasks, such as managing sales and tracking financial and inventory data. It has more than 200 customers in 20 
countries, including well-known U.S. retailers like Best Buy , Gap and Nordstrom . The retail industry is a 
potentially lucrative market for business software companies, with analysts valuing the market opportunity well 
above $10 billion annually. Retek had revenue of $174.2 million last year and employs around 525 people in 
Atlanta, London and Melbourne. Redwood Shores, Calif.-based, Oracle last Thursday trumped the second and 
final SAP offer at $11 a share. Ellison had said he wanted to acquire Retek to defend what he called his firm's 
leading position in the North American market for business application software. Retek has been an Oracle 
partner and customer for two decades. Analysts say the market opportunity is comparable with other sectors like 
financial services or manufacturing, but retailers have lagged behind in spending to align technology with the 
latest business processes. Many retailers, loath to make heavy investments in software, have traditionally built 
their own software applications, partly due to their traditionally thin margins. The companies are now realizing the

(updates with CEO quotes, background) REDWOOD SHORES, Calif (XFN-ASIA) - Oracle Corp signed a 
definitive merger agreement to buy Retek Inc for 11.25 usd per share, the companies said. "Oracle has the 
largest applications business in North America, and we intend to expand that leadership position," said Oracle 
CEO Larry Ellison. "Combining Oracle with Retek is an important step in that direction, and it strengthens our 
position in the retail applications market globally." "We believe that Oracle's offer is a good deal for Retek 
stockholders, and all directors in attendance at our board meeting have recommended that it be accepted," said 
Retek CEO Marty Leestma. "We will work with Oracle over the next several weeks to ensure that the integration 
is not disruptive for our clients and employees." Oracle had been involved in a bid auction for Retek with SAP AG. 
The German chipmaker pulled out late last week after what it termed its final offer of 11 usd per share was 
trumped by its US rival.

NEW YORK, March 22 (AFP) - 
Oracle said Tuesday it won a bidding war for software group Retek after outbidding German rival SAP, giving the 
Silicon Valley firm a strong base in the fast-growing market for retail-industry software. 
Oracle, the world's second-largest software maker but behind SAP in business management software, agreed to 
pay 630 million dollars, or 11.25 dollars a share, for Retek, which specializes in management software for 
retailers. 
Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison said the acquisition of Retek "strengthens our position in the retail 
applications market globally." 
Retek brings to the Silicon Valley-based Oracle a group of prestigious retail clients, including US apparel giant 
The Gap, electronic retailer Best Buy and British supermarket group Sainsbury. 
Retek provides customers in the retail industry with software to help them carry out a variety of tasks, such as 
managing sales and tracking financial and inventory data. It has more than 200 customers in 20 countries, and 
posted revenue of 174.2 million dollars last year. 
Analysts see growth potential in the retail marketplace. Retailers are now realizing the need to update technology 
to keep pace as giants like Wal-Mart have become a huge force across the industry. 
Oracle's offer upped the price after a bid made this week by SAP of 11 dollars a share. 
A spokesman for SAP, Europe's largest software group, confirmed that the company had backed out but declined 
further comment. 
SAP on Tuesday said it did not believe its shareholders or customers would benefit from the auction process that 
"would further inflate the purchase price, and in the long run, not deliver the returns we demand."

financial discipline in merger and acquisition transactions." 
Under Retek's prior merger agreement with SAP, the US firm would be forced to pay a termination fee of 25 
million dollars. Oracle would likely foot the bill for the breakup fee. 
The hostile bid victory was the second for Ellison and Oracle in the past four months. 
In December, Ellison triumphed in a bitter 18-month battle to acquire PeopleSoft for around 10.5 billion dollars, 
despite fierce opposition from board members. 
That deal placed Oracle second behind its German rival in the overall market for business software. The rivalry 
between the firms has since intensified, and Oracle's latest move could hinder SAP from gaining a stronger 
footing in the United States, the world's largest software market. 
"We view this as a minor setback for SAP. Feedback from industry participants suggests it will put back SAP's 
North American retail ambitions by a couple of years," analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. SAP may look 
for alternative targets, the brokerage added, citing privately held Evant as an example, to bolster its retail offering.

Plugged In: Curbing Those Echoes on the Phone

It's not easy to find sensible investments among small-cap tech stocks. Seemingly under-valued names are often 
cheap for good reason: They've blown quarters, missed earnings targets or lost a slew of customers. Yet, for 
investors willing to do some digging and take some risk, the payoff can be spectacular. 
One fellow toiling in those fields is Bryant Riley, chief executive of B. Riley & Co., a Los Angeles-based securities 
boutique that scours California for orphans and unloved companies. He and his analysts seek out overlooked 
small fry that, they think, have strong prospects and good management, even if profits are still skimpy. 
B. Riley, which concentrates on research and trading, invited some 120 companies to its stock conference in Las 
Vegas last week, trying to give some attention to these lovable losers. Wall Street, he says, is too quantitative to 
appreciate this kind of company. "They just think that companies that lose money are bad, but eventually they can 
turn things around," he says. "You just have to have valuation targets that you stick to," Riley says. 
Right now Riley is especially fond of Ditech Communications (DITC), an niche player in telecommunications 
technology. Mountain View, Calif.-based Ditech makes "echo cancellation systems" for telephone network, gear 
that tries to eliminate that, well, echo effect in one's handset. The company, with a market value of $382 million, 
moved into profitability last year after two years of losses. 
B. Riley initiated coverage of Ditech back in December 2002 at 2.39, downgraded it about a year later after the 
stock had risen to about 10, and upgraded it back to Buy in October 2003 at about 9. B. Riley rode that wave all 
the way back to about 24 a year later, when it downgraded back to neutral. 
With the shares now at 11.94 -- a reasonable four times sales -- Riley research chief Wes Cummins is back with a 
Buy rating. He thinks the company could be ready for another big run. It's getting increased orders from some big 
phone companies, and it has developed an echo-cancelling product for the booming field of Voice Over Internet 
Protocol (VoIP). 
Cummins, likes the company's cash horde of about $135 million, thinks cash flow could surge 94% this year and 
was pleased to see the company buy back about $34 million of its own stock in December. Says Ditech Chief 
Financial Officer Bill Tamblyn: "We just felt it was a good use of our cash." 
Patent Wars 
It looks like the ongoing patent skirmish between Eolas Technologies and Microsoft over browsers has had an 
important spill-over effect for the rest of the software industry. As readers of this column will recall, the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently overturned a jury verdict that would have required Microsoft to pay 
Eolas $521 million in damages ("No Quantum Leap to HP," March 7, 2005). But one key aspect of the lower 
court's decision was left standing: A new approach for calculating damages awards in cases involving American 
software firms that sell their wares overseas. 
Previously, U.S. patent infringement law largely did not apply to software sold outside of the country. But the 
appeals court, which has a big say in patent law, has decided in the Eolas case that all seats, or work stations, 
licensed for the software must be counted in the damages, including seats overseas.

Page 151 of 165 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
This decision will affect the scope of damages in software patent-infringement cases in a major way, says 
intellectual property attorney Kelly A. Clement, a partner with Howrey Simon Arnold & White in Washington, D.C. 
"Every disk and every license will now be subject to a royalty fee," regardless of where the seat is, he said. 
The ruling is good news for plaintiffs in patent-infringement cases, but bad news for the defendants if they lose. In 
many cases, such as with Microsoft, software companies may find themselves at both ends of the equation from 
time to time. 
There is another wrinkle in this case worthy of some reflection. Eolas is suing Microsoft for allegedly infringing on 
its patent on certain interactive applications with Microsoft's Explorer Internet browser. But the appellate court 
ruled there may have been other engineers who developed code similar to that written by Eolas prior to the 
Chicago firm's application for a patent. If the technology did exist before Eolas' patent application, it could negate 
Eolas' patent protection on the software. Separately, the U.S. Patent Office is considering that very thing -- 
stripping Eolas of its patent. 
The irony in all of this is that the early non-Eolas browser technology was actually demonstrated to engineers 
from Microsoft rival Sun Microsystems before Microsoft entered the browser field. So, if you allow me to indulge in 
some Monday morning quarterbacking, Sun may have been in position to buy browser technology that might 
have kept Microsoft out of the browser business, if Sun had gotten a patent. What do you suppose Netscape 
co-founders Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen have to say to Sun CEO Scott McNealy about that? 
Will SAP Bow Out? 
It appears that Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison is putting his money where his mouth is. For nearly two years 
now, he has been talking about going on a shopping spree, turning his database company into the predominant 
business software company in the world. Of course, Germany's SAP is going to say something about that. But in 
their first head-to-head acquisition bidding war, SAP may step aside and let Oracle win. 
Goldman Sachs' well-connected software analyst Rick Sherlund is predicting that "SAP is unlikely to bid higher" 
for Retek, a developer of enterprise software for the retail industry. 
SAP appeared to have its bid for Retek sewn up until Oracle entered the picture and bid about 9 a share, up 50 
cents from SAP's agreed price. SAP raised its bid late last week to 11, only to have Oracle immediately top that at 
11.25. 
Sherlund thinks that SAP could afford to pay still more without the deal diluting its shares, but that the company 
may opt to build its own retail products rather than pay inflated prices driven by Ellison's tactics. Sherlund also 
points out that Oracle raised its bid for Peoplesoft after declaring a "last and final offer." It looks like SAP is not 
going to play that game. 
Retail is an area where SAP needs to improve, but the company seems to be making a statement that it is not 
going to lose its discipline and let Oracle set the agenda. 
"SAP is in a better position to offer Retek and SAP customers a swift and painless path to the integration of these 
and other third-party applications," SAP said in a statement. The company contends that integration will take 
place at the applications level, its strength, as opposed to the database level, which is Oracle's strong suit. Oracle 
declined to comment.

The bidding war between Oracle and SAP for control of retail automation software specialist Retek escalated 
yesterday as the two rivals raised their offers to buy the Minnesota-based firm. 
Oracle has upped the ante with a counter offer of US$11.25 a share for Retek's outstanding stock, trumping 
German business software giant SAP's revised bid of US$11 a share, made on Thursday. 
Oracle made a surprise move on March 8 to acquire Retek for US$504 million in cash, or US$9 a share, eight 
days after SAP signed a merger deal with Retek at a purchase price of US$8.50 a share. 
"Oracle is likely to win the bidding war for Retek," said market research firm Gartner in a recent report. 
With its latest cash tender offer, Oracle has valued Retek at US$631 million. Oracle has already purchased 5.5 
million shares of Retek common stock, or nearly 10 per cent of total shares outstanding. 
"Customers have told us they want Oracle to buy Retek," Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison said. "Retek's 
applications are built on Oracle's technology platform." 
Mr Ellison also noted that Retek and Oracle "share a vision of applications built using industry standards like 
Java", not proprietary software programming languages like SAP's Advanced Business Application Programming. 
Oracle's sweetened bid appears to have doused cold water on the Retek board's approval to the merger and its 
recommendation to company shareholders to accept SAP's modified offer. 
Under the amended merger deal for the purchase price of US$11 a share, the termination fee was increased from 
US$15 million to US$25 million. 
Leo Apotheker, SAP president of global field operations and a member of its executive board, said SAP's merger 
with Retek would be more advantageous to both companies' customers. 
In an obvious swipe at Oracle, which sells more database software than business automation systems, Mr 
Apotheker said: "With SAP, customers have a choice in selecting their database - customers are not locked into a 
single database vendor." 
Retek provides an integrated retail application suite and other related software to more than 200 customers in 
more than 20 countries. 
It posted revenues last year of US$174.2 million.

SAN FRANCISCO, March 18 -- The Oracle Corporation raised its bid for Retek, a software maker, to $631 million 
late Thursday, leapfrogging the latest offer of $617 million from SAP and escalating the two-week-old bidding war. 
Oracle, a maker of business and database software, increased its offer from $9 a share of Retek to $11.25 a 
share just a few hours after SAP, the global leader in the business software market, announced its ''best and final 
offer'' of $11 a share. 
Before Oracle's announcement, Retek's board unanimously accepted the offer from SAP. Under the terms of that 
agreement, Retek would have to pay SAP a termination fee of $25 million, up from a previous $15 million, to walk 
away from the deal. 
Retek, based in Minneapolis, makes software that manages sales, inventory and supply chain information for the 
retail industry. The company, whose clients include Best Buy and Gap, had $174.2 million in revenue in 2004. 
Shares of Retek fell 18 cents, to close at $11.47. The company would not comment on Oracle's increased bid. 
SAP first offered $496 million, or $8.50 a share, for Retek on Feb. 28. The company, with headquarters in 
Germany, said the merger would allow it to integrate Retek products into its own offerings and increase its 
presence in the fast-growing retail software market. Shares of Oracle fell 62 cents, to $12.54. 
''The combination of SAP and Retek will provide customers worldwide with a deep industry knowledge that they 
could not get from any other software combination,'' Leo Apotheker, president of SAP's global field operations, 
said in a statement. 
But on March 8, Oracle made an unsolicited counterbid of $9 a share, or $525 million. Lawrence J. Ellison, 
Oracle's chief executive, said in a statement late Thursday that the company wanted to acquire Retek to maintain 
the market lead in North America. ''We intend to defend our No. 1 position,'' Mr. Ellison said. ''Customers have 
told us they want Oracle to buy Retek.''

Oracle's quick return to the takeover market could see it mounting multi-billion dollar bids again as early as this 
summer, according to company executives and Wall street analysts. 
The US software company delivered another sign of its determination to lead the consolidation of the business 
software market late on Thursday when it raised its takeover offer for Retek, a specialist US maker of software for 
retailers, by 25 per cent to Dollars 645m. 
That marked the second time in 10 days that it had topped a rival, agreed offer from SAP of Germany. The fight 
over Retek could be only a prelude to much bigger deals in the coming months, however. 
At the time it completed its takeover of PeopleSoft for Dollars 10.3bn early this year, Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief 
executive officer, said his company would take a year to digest the deal. The comment appeared to be aimed at 
calming concerns on Wall Street about Oracle's ability to retain PeopleSoft customers after the bruising 18- month 
battle. 
More recently, Chuck Phillips, Oracle's co-president, has said the company could be free to make big acquisitions 
again much sooner. It needs only to show in two quarters of results that the integration of PeopleSoft has gone 
smoothly, he said - a period that ends three months from now. Speaking recently, Mr Phillips declared the 
integration of the PeopleSoft acquisition, still barely two months old, complete. 
One Wall Street analyst, who declined to be named, said he expected Oracle to announce more multi-billion 
dollar deals much sooner than it had earlier suggested. The company has put down markers on possible takeover 
targets, expressing public interest in BEA Systems, which is worth Dollars 3.3bn, and Siebel Systems, worth 
Dollars 4.6bn. 
Mr Ellison's attempt at a rapid "roll-up" of a group of companies to create a broad-based business software group 
echoes Computer Associates' series of mergers in the 1990s but is likely to be far harder to pull off, said Tom 
Berquist, software analyst at Smith Barney. "There are going to be problems along the way," he said. 
Besides being larger than Computer Associates' acquisitions, Oracle's current and planned deals spanned a 
wider range of software. 
Along with the operations of JD Edwards, a software company absorbed by PeopleSoft shortly before its own 
takeover, a purchase of Retek would leave Oracle trying to integrate three companies simultaneously, Mr 
Berquist added. 
Tracking Oracle's success in integrating its acquisitions will be difficult in the short term, analysts said.

LOS ANGELES (XFN-ASIA) -- Will German software giant SAP AG once again try to wrest Retek Inc. away from 
Oracle Corp. Chief Executive Larry Ellison by topping Oracle's latest bid for the retail software maker? Not likely, 
judging by Retek's latest share price move and the determination of Ellison to keep his longtime partner in the 
Oracle camp. Retek shares fell 18 cents, or 1.6 percent, to close at $11.47 on Friday, as fewer investors bet that 
SAP would escalate the bidding war by boosting what it called its best and final offer of $11 a share. Redwood 
Shores, Calif.-based, Oracle overnight raised its cash tender offer for Retek to $11.25 a share. The bid is worth 
$643 million, based on the fully diluted share count from Retek's last quarterly earnings report. That trumped the 
latest SAP offer worth around $629 million in total. It was the second time this month that Ellison trumped an 
SAP bid for Minneapolis-based Retek. 
Both companies' bids have now won antitrust clearance from the U.S. Justice Department. The outspoken 
Ellison has said he wants to acquire Retek to defend what he called his firm's leading position in the North 
American market for business application software. What's more, Retek has been an Oracle partner and 
customer for two decades. The move also would boost Oracle's position in the market serving retailers, which 
represents a potentially lucrative, undertapped market for business software makers. Analysts say the market 
opportunity is comparable with other sectors like financial services or manufacturing, but retailers have lagged 
behind in spending to align technology with the latest business processes. Many retailers, loath to make heavy 
investments in software, have traditionally built their own software applications, partly due to their traditionally thin 
margins. The companies, however, are now realizing the need to update their technology to keep pace as giant 
retailers like Wal-Mart have become a huge force across the industry. Oracle and SAP are both jockeying to 
acquire a software vendor, like Retek, with expertise in serving retailers as well as a top-notch client list. "Our 
North American applications business is larger than SAP's. We intend to defend our No. 1 position," Ellison said 
in a statement. In December, Ellison triumphed in a bitter 18-month battle to acquire PeopleSoft Inc. for around 
$10.5 billion. That deal placed Oracle second behind its German rival in the overall market for business software. 
The rivalry between the two firms has since intensified, and Oracle's latest move could hinder SAP, Europe's 
largest software concern, from gaining a stronger footing in the United States, the world's largest software market. 
SAP declined to comment Friday on Oracle's latest counteroffer. Retek also declined to comment. SAP's 
U.S.-traded shares lost 12 cents, or 0.3 percent, to end the session at $40.13, while Oracle stock dropped 62 
cents, or 4.7 percent, to close at $12.54. SAP bid already accepted Retek's board unanimously recommended 
that its shareholders accept SAP's $11 a share bid, which expires April 1 at noon Eastern time. Under Retek's 
agreement with SAP, it would be forced to pay a termination fee of $25 million, up from a previous $15 million, to 
walk away from the deal. If Oracle is successful in acquiring Retek, it would likely foot the bill for the breakup fee. 
Yet Retek shares are trading more than 4 percent higher than SAP's bid, and Oracle already has acquired 5.5 
million shares of Retek's common stock, representing nearly 10 percent of its outstanding shares. UBS analyst 
Heather Bellini said SAP and Oracle could sustain a bidding war valuing Retek up to around $15 a share, but 
surmised that SAP wouldn't be drawn into an all-out bidding war. Bellini said she thinks SAP management "did 
indeed make its best and final offer at $11 [a share]." "Rather than distract management time and resources by 
engaging in bidding games with Oracle, we expect SAP to move on," the analyst wrote in a note to clients. At 
Bear Stearns, analysts told clients they expect SAP to walk away from the deal. They added that driving up 
Retek's price could potentially inflate valuations of other deal targets. While Sven Kuerten, an analyst with 
Bankhaus Metzler Seel Sohn & Co. in Frankfurt, said he wasn't surprised to see SAP's earlier increased bid, he 
thinks that indeed the offer represented SAP's final bid. "My personal gut feeling is that this could be the last offer 
from SAP as it's already quite expensive," Kuerten asserted. Smith Barney Citigroup analyst Tom Berquist agreed 
that SAP was probably not going to up the ante again. "We believe it is unlikely that SAP will come back in over 
the top and is more likely to put the $25 million breakup fee toward a different acquisition," Berquist said. 
"However, if events have proven anything, it is that anything is possible in this staredown," he added. Retail 
industry a 'strategic priority' The retail industry is a potentially lucrative market for business software companies, 
with analysts valuing the market opportunity well in excess of $10 billion a year. SAP executive board member

Leo Apotheker highlighted the importance of the market, saying the retail industry is a "strategic priority" for SAP. 
Apotheker's statement echoed comments made by Oracle's Ellison. "The retail market is not dominated by any 
one company at this point in time," Ellison said during a recent conference call to discuss Oracle's pursuit of 
Retek. "It's a large market, and it's an available market. So we think it's strategically important for us to pursue 
this acquisition." Retek provides an A-list of customers in the retail industry with software to help them carry out a 
variety of tasks, such as managing sales and tracking financial and inventory data. It has more than 200 
customers in 20 countries, including well-known U.S. retailers like Best Buy , the Gap and Nordstrom . Retek had 
revenue of $174.2 million last year and employs around 525 people in Atlanta, London and Melbourne, Australia.

LOS ANGELES (XFN-ASIA) - Will German software giant SAP once again try to wrest Retek Inc. away from 
Oracle Corp. Chief Executive Larry Ellison by topping Oracle's latest bid for the retail software maker? Not likely, 
judging by Retek's latest share price move and the determination of Ellison to keep his long-time partner in the

Oracle once again topped arch-rival SAP's takeover offer for US software firm Retek on Thursday night, raising 
its all-cash hostile bid to US$645m barely 12 hours after the German software giant had increased its own, 
agreed on, offer. 
Oracle increased its own offer from US$9 to US$11.25 a share, just 2 per cent above SAP's bid. 
The tussle over Retek, which makes software for retailers, has come to symbolise an intense new phase in the 
transatlantic rivalry between the two software giants. 
While Oracle's recent US$10.3bn acquisition of PeopleSoft has taken it into more direct competition with SAP in 
the market for back-office applications used by large-size companies, SAP has tried to take advantage of the 
disruption caused by the deal to push more aggressively into Oracle's home market. 
The German company has also moved into "middleware", which provides the so-called "plumbing" on which 
software applications depend, and traditionally a sector dominated by Oracle. 
"Oracle is not going to cede any ground in any industry to SAP," said Scott Langdoc, a retail analyst at ARM, a 
US technology research firm. "The battle between these two for dominance is the Retek shareholders' gain." 
Larry Ellison, chief executive officer, made clear last week that the fight over Retek had broader significance. 
"We are the number one applications business in North America and we intend to defend that position," he 
declared. 
The latest bid from Oracle capped a flurry of activity in recent days. Earlier on Thursday, SAP had raised its 
original US$8.50 a share agreed offer for Minneapolis-based Retek by 29 per cent to $11, topping Oracle's $9 per 
share bid last week. 
SAP and Retek have also increased the break-up fee that Retek would have to pay if it breaks off the deal to 
US$25m. 
The German company also signaled that it would not raise its offer again, calling its latest bid its "best and final" 
offer. That declaration was a strange tactic to use in the face of a hostile bid since it appeared to leave the 
advantage with Oracle, one takeover trader said on Thursday. However, such statements were not binding in the 
US, he added - a fact that Oracle itself took advantage of last year when it raised its hostile bid for PeopleSoft 
despite declaring an earlier offer final. 
SAP has made increasing inroads into the US and has set out to woo former PeopleSoft customers. It recently 
bought TomorrowNow, a small private technology services firm that provides maintenance support for PeopleSoft 
products. 
Meanwhile, Oracle appeared determined to secure a takeover of Retek "if only as a 'quid pro quo' for SAP's 
acquisition of TomorrowNow," said one London-based software analyst, speaking before the US company lodged 
its higher bid. 
Adding to the pressure on Oracle is its reliance on Retek to enter the retail industry market, analysts say. "If SAP 
gets Retek, Oracle has no definitive retail strategy," said Mr Langdoc.

Separately, Oracle on Thursday said its chief financial officer, Harry You, resigned to become chief executive of 
BearingPoint, the consulting and business services group formerly known as KPMG Consulting. 
Oracle said co-president Safra Catz would serve as interim finance chief until a replacement was hired. Mr You, 
45, was appointed to his post at Oracle in July 2004, after a six-month search. 
He previously served as finance chief at Accenture, a rival of KPMG, beginning in 2001. Before that he held 
positions at Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers.

Oracle embroiled in more drama after PeopleSoft saga 
Oracle embroiled in more drama after PeopleSoft saga

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Just a few months after one tumultuous saga ended, more drama is brewing at Oracle 
Corp. as the business software maker spars with German rival SAP AG in a takeover duel and copes with the 
abrupt departure of its chief financial officer at a critical juncture. 
Oracle and its CEO Larry Ellison have overcome 18 months of resistance to complete the largest deal in its 
industry's history -- the $10.3 billion acquisition of PeopleSoft Inc. 
Investors aren't thrilled about the prospect of more turmoil while Oracle tries to stitch together the different 
products, customers and corporate cultures that it picked up in the PeopleSoft deal. 
Oracle's shares fell 62 cents, or 4.7 percent, to close at $12.54 Friday on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The session 
provided the stock market's first reaction to two developments late Thursday. The stock has been trading at a 
52-week range of $9.78 to $14.87. 
Just a few hours after announcing its CFO is leaving to become the CEO of another company, Oracle raised its 
unsolicited bid for retail software maker Retek Inc. to $11.25 per share, or $669 million. 
Redwood Shores-based Oracle upped its offer from $9 per share after Minneapolis-based Retek accepted an 
$11-per-share bid from SAP. 
"We have received word from the U.S. regulatory authorities that the Oracle acquisition of Retek has received 
early termination, clearing the way for Oracle to move forward with the transaction," Oracle spokesman Jeff Lettes 
said in a statement Friday. 
The bidding war came as no surprise. Oracle already had vowed to wrest Retek away from SAP as part of its 
aggressive expansion in business applications software -- the computer coding that automates a wide range of 
administrative tasks. 
Whether Oracle has upped the ante enough to break up Retek's existing sales agreement with SAP remains 
unclear, said industry analyst Joshua Greenbaum. "If they had gone to $12 (per share), that could have been a 
real knockout punch. This bid seems more like a mild swipe." 
SAP declined to comment Friday on Oracle's latest move. 
Retek's shares fell 18 cents, or 1.6 percent, to close at $11.47 on the Nasdaq, an indication that investors don't 
expect the bidding to rise much higher. Retek's market value already has nearly doubled since two of the world's 
biggest software makers began pursuing it. The stock has been trading at a 52-week range of $3.40 to $11.88. 
The news that Oracle is losing CFO Harry You was more unsettling. You, hired just eight months ago, stepped 
down to run BearingPoint Inc., a major business services consultant grappling with accounting problems. 
Although You wasn't at Oracle long enough to become a familiar face at the company, his departure nevertheless 
raised anxieties because the PeopleSoft combination is still in its early stages and he was being counted on to 
ensure the takeover pays off. 
Oracle tried to reassure investors by temporarily filling the CFO post with co-President Safra Catz, a former 
investment banker who helped orchestrate the PeopleSoft takeover.

Until Oracle finds a permanent replacement, Catz figures to be on the hot seat as the company strives to boost its 
profit by at least $400 million in the fiscal year ending in May 2006. 
Oracle is expected to discuss the deal's progress next Tuesday when it's scheduled to report its first quarterly 
results since completing the takeover. 
Analysts are divided on whether it makes sense for Oracle to fight SAP over Retek, given the hard work still 
ahead in the PeopleSoft takeover. 
In a research note issued Friday, Piper Jaffray analyst Tad Piper questioned whether Retek is worth Oracle's 
current offer, as the price translates to more than $3 million for each of the 200 customers that will be acquired. 
By comparison, Oracle paid about $808,000 to acquire each of PeopleSoft's 12,750 customers. 
Other analysts say Retek is an extremely attractive takeover target because most of its retailers haven't bought 
much software, giving Oracle or SAP a prime opportunity to sell a broad mix of technology.
