The Sprint Nextel Corp. affiliate acquisition train continued to roll as the carrier picked up its largest cargo 
yet-CDMA affiliate Alamosa Holdings Inc. for $4.3 billion. 
The purchase price includes Sprint Nextel assuming $900 million of Alamosa debt. 
Under terms of the deal, Sprint Nextel will purchase Alamosa's common stock at $18.75 per share in an all-cash 
transaction. The price was a 14-percent premium above Alamosa's opening stock price of $16.17 per share the 
day the deal was announced. Alamosa's stock surged on the news to $18.39 per share before trading was halted. 
Alamosa will give Sprint Nextel approximately 1.5 million direct wireless subscribers in 242 service areas in 19 
states. 
Sprint Nextel noted the purchase price represents a 9.8 times projected 2006 adjusted operating income before 
depreciation and amortization. The deal is expected to close early next year. 
``This acquisition closes a long partnership with the management and shareholders of Alamosa,'' said Gary 
Forsee, president and chief executive officer of Sprint Nextel. ``As the largest PCS affiliate, we appreciate their 
efforts over the years to grow Sprint's business and we look forward to continuing a strong relationship with their 
customers. This transaction will significantly expand our direct customer base and territory, and will provide 
additional value for our shareholders.'' 
The agreement closes a contentious issue between Sprint Nextel and Alamosa. Alamosa initiated legal 
proceedings against Sprint Nextel following Sprint Corp.'s acquisition of Nextel Communications Inc. on Aug. 12. 
Alamosa claimed the acquisition violated terms of its affiliate agreement. 
Alamosa bolstered its network holdings earlier this year when it acquired fellow affiliate AirGate PCS Inc. for $630 
million. In addition to acquiring AirGate's operations, Alamosa also picked up AirGate's more comprehensive 
affiliate agreement, which prevented Sprint from offering wireless service using any licensed spectrum in 
AirGate's service areas. Alamosa's agreement only prevented Sprint from offering service using the 1.9 GHz 
spectrum band. Analysts noted this was significant because Nextel's iDEN network uses spectrum in the 800 
MHz bands, and the AirGate exclusivity provision prevented Sprint Nextel from marketing Sprint-branded iDEN 
services in Alamosa's markets. 
``We are pleased to accept Sprint's offer to acquire our company,'' said Alamosa Chairman and CEO David 
Sharbutt. ``We have enjoyed a successful business relationship with Sprint that has benefited both companies. 
Our shareholders and employees can be proud of our results and the value that we have created in Alamosa.'' 
Sprint Nextel has already acquired a handful of its CDMA affiliates, including US Unwired Inc. for $1.3 billion, 
IWO Holdings Inc. for $427 million and Gulf Coast Wireless L.P. for $287.5 million. According to the RCR 
Wireless News Database, only a handful of CDMA affiliates remain independent, including UbiquiTel Inc.; iPCS 
Inc. and its subsidiaries Horizon Personal Communications Inc. and Bright Personal Communications Services 
L.L.C.; Swiftel/Brookings; Northern PCS; Shenandoah Telecommunications Co.; and Enterprise Communications. 
The Alamosa deal revved up UbiquiTel's investors as the carrier's stock price surged more than 10 percent on 
Nov. 21 to a new 52-week high of $9.77 per share, and jumped even higher the following day to $9.82 per share, 
before eventually falling back to around $9.70 per share. IPCS saw a similar jump, with its stock price climbing 
from $39 per share to as much $43.25 per share, before dropping to around $42 per share.

SG Cowen & Co. telecom analyst Thomas Watts noted that using the 9.8 times multiple Sprint Nextel paid for 
Alamosa would imply an UbiquiTel acquisition price of $10.90 per share. UbiquiTel and iPCS both have 
December court dates regarding their claims against Sprint Nextel, which could indicate an out-of-court 
settlement is close at hand. 
Partner problems 
While Sprint Nextel's plans to acquire its CDMA affiliates appears on track, the carrier continues to run into 
trouble with its planned acquisition of iDEN affiliate Nextel Partners Inc. 
Nextel Partners scored a significant victory on Nov. 18 when a judge ruled the carrier could disclose the results of 
the first two appraisers in its ongoing battle with Sprint Nextel to determine a ``fair market value'' price for Sprint 
Nextel's forced purchase of the 68 percent of Nextel Partners it does not already own. 
Nextel Partners said its original affiliate agreement required the carrier to disclose the appraisal results once they 
were done. The appraisals, which are being conducted by Nextel Partners' choice of Morgan Stanley & Co. and 
Sprint Nextel's choice of Lazard Ltd., are set to be completed by Dec. 28. If the two appraisals are more than 10 
percent apart, a third appraiser will be tapped to provide a final valuation. 
Sprint Nextel had claimed that the findings of the third appraiser would be tainted by the release of the first two 
appraisals. Nextel Partners countered that all three appraisals should be conducted at the same time in order to 
avoid any contamination. 
Nextel Partners also noted that the Delaware court agreed with the affiliate's interpretation of how the fair market 
value should be determined. Nextel Partners has said that its affiliate agreement calls for a fair market valuation 
to discount any negative impact the carrier's use of iDEN technology or non-congruent spectrum would have on 
determining the company's value. 
Sprint Nextel had claimed that Nextel Partners' technology and spectrum position make it attractive only to Sprint 
Nextel as an acquisition target. 
``In sum, Partners advocates an approach to fair market value that would require the appraisers to value a 
fantasy company, using fantasy prices, in a fantasy technological and competitive environment, under a definition 
of fair market value that exists only in Partners' fantasies,'' Sprint Nextel noted in its pre-trial filing. 
Nextel Partners has said the final valuation should be determined by early February. Nextel Partners' stock is 
trading at around $26 per share with a market capitalization of more than $7 billion.

(Updates with background starting in the third paragraph.) 
By Roger Cheng 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Sprint Nextel Corp.'s (S) acquisition of its largest affiliate, Alamosa Holdings Inc. 
(APCS), signals the wireless carrier may run the table in buying the remaining players. 
Since the completion of its merger with Nextel Communications Inc., Sprint has been embroiled in often bitter 
disputes from its various affiliates - 10 on the Sprint side and Nextel Partners Inc. (NXTP) on the Nextel end. The 
various affiliates balked at what they felt was a violation of their regional exclusivity agreements. 
With the acquisition of Alamosa, Sprint clears its largest hurdle. At 1.5 million subscribers based in the Central 
and Western U.S., Alamosa represents nearly half of the Sprint affiliates' subscribers. Sprint typically includes its 
affiliates for its total subscriber base, which was 45.6 million as of the third quarter. Cingular Wireless is firmly in 
the lead with 52.3 million subscribers. 
Sprint maintains it is exploring all options with the other affiliates. "Acquisition is still not the only solution," said 
Nick Sweers, a spokesman for Sprint. "It's always an option to reaffiliate, and I don't want to rule it out." 
Still, analysts believe that forming new deals with the smaller players makes little sense. "If you're forming a new 
agreement, you'd start with the bellwether in Alamosa," said William Power, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & 
Co. "It's probably easier to roll them up." 
There are six affiliates left - three publicly traded companies in Ubiquitel Inc. (UPCS), IPCS Inc. (IPCX) and 
Shenandoah Telecommunications Co. (SHEN) and three private players in Northern PCS, Enterprise PCS and 
Swiftel Communications. Shares of IPCS and Ubiquitel were up strongly, indicating investors believe they will be 
bought up. 
Sprint previously acquired US Unwired, IWO Holdings Inc. and Gulf Coast Wireless Limited Partnership for 
roughly $2 billion combined. 
The $4.3 billion cash deal, which values Alamosa at $18.75 a share and $2,867 per subscriber, is a fair price for 
both sides, Power said. Though a little pricier than the other affiliate deals, the premium is justified given its size. 
He added the affiliate is younger and shows faster growth than the more mature Sprint. 
"It's pretty consistent with how we thought it would shake out," he said. The analyst doesn't have any conflicts of 
interest to report. 
One analyst, however, felt Alamosa shareholders were getting the short shrift. "I think that Alamosa got ripped 
off," said Patrick Comack, an analyst with Zachary Investment Research. "I think they should vote 'no' on this 
deal. 
Comack had Alamosa valued at $22.50. He believes the stock is worth more, given its exclusivity deal with Sprint, 
which is believed to be stronger than some of the other affiliate agreements.

Page 5 of 43 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Alamosa also had a stronger bargaining position from its ability to derail Sprint's deal with the cable companies to 
form a joint venture, Comack said. 
For Sprint, the deal is a positive. "[Sprint Chief Executive] Gary Forsee continues to impress me more and more," 
he said. "The man is a supreme deal cutter." 
Zachary owns shares in Ubiquitel and Alamosa. While Comack doesn't own stock in the companies directly, he 
has a stake in his firm. 
With the deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter, Alamosa and Sprint will seek an immediate stay of 
litigation over the alleged violation of exclusivity. Sprint had reached a temporary agreement with Ubiquitel and 
IPCS to continue talks until Jan. 1 before legal action would be taken. 
But the increasingly bitter conflict between Sprint and Nextel Partners continues. Nextel Partners scored a legal 
victory Friday after a judge from Delaware's Court of Chancery ruled that both parties must reveal their numbers 
to their appraisers in determining the value of Nextel Partners. Sprint had wanted the reports of the first two 
appraisers to be kept secret. 
Unlike the Sprint affiliate, Nextel Partners had the option of forcing a buyout. A deal, which will be larger than any 
of the other affiliate buyouts given its size, is expected sometime in the middle of next year. 
Sprint recently traded at $25.10, up 16 cents, or 0.6%, on volume of 8.6 million shares. Average daily volume is 
11.6 million. 
Alamosa rose $2.09, or 12.9%, to $18.35, on volume of 14.5 million shares. Average daily volume is 1.9 million 
shares.

Sprint to buy two wireless partners for $714 million - UPDATE 8

WASHINGTON (XFN-ASIA) -- Sprint Nextel Corp. said Tuesday it would acquire two small affiliates for a 
combined $714 million, as part of a broader effort to iron out contractual differences with its wireless partners. 
Sprint said it would pay $427 million, or $42.50 a share, in cash for IWO Holdings Inc., of Albany, N.Y., including 
the assumption of $208 million in debt. At the same time, the company agreed to acquire Gulf Coast Wireless of 
Baton Rouge, La., in a deal valued at $287.5 million. 
IWO, which posted $187 million in sales in 2004, serves 237,000 customers in upstate New York, Pennsylvania 
and New England. Gulf Coast Wireless, which caters to 95,000 subscribers in southern Louisiana and 
Mississippi, generated $88 million in revenue last year. 
Sprint has nine affiliates that use the Sprint brand and sell wireless service, mostly in rural areas. 
Many affiliates were on course to compete with Sprint in the wake of the company's recently completed $35 billion 
acquisition of Nextel. The affiliates have exclusive rights to sell Sprint-branded service in their territories, but 
Nextel also operates in those areas. 
To solve the problem, Sprint has been seeking to renegotiate contracts with affiliates or to buy them outright. 
"Acquisition is one solution, but it's not the only solution," spokesman Nick Sweers said. 
In its purchase of IWO, Sprint paid the equivalent of 10.8 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortization, based on the 12 months that ended on June 30 and excluding onetime items. The company paid 
9.2 times for Gulf Coast Wireless on a similar basis. 
In an interview two weeks ago, Sprint Chief Executive Gary Forsee told MarketWatch that the company might 
acquire partners that wanted to end the relationship. He said agreements with the rest of its affiliates should be 
completed within a few months. 
Earlier this summer, Sprint paid $1.3 billion to acquire US Unwired Inc. , the second largest of Sprint's affiliates. 
US Unwired served more than 500,000 customers, mostly in the South. 
Other notable Sprint affiliates include Alamosa Holdings Inc. , iPCS and UbiquiTel . 
Alamosa stock rose 15 cents to $16.89 and UbiquiTel climbed 74 cents at $8.68, a 9.3% gain. 
Since Foresee took over Sprint in 2003, he has sought to patch up relationships with its affiliates so the company 
could focus its main energy on battling larger rivals like Cingular Wireless and Verizon Wireless. 
Sprint and Nextel completed their merger in mid-August and the combined company now trades under the new 
symbol "S," which used to belong to Sears Roebuck & Co. On Tuesday, Sprint shares fell 33 cents to $25.25. 
Nextel had similar business ties with Nextel Partners , a Kirkland, Wash. -based affiliate that holds a "put" option 
requiring Sprint Nextel to buy out the company. 
Nextel Partners has said it intends to exercise that option, which could cost Sprint as much as $5 billion. The 
company sells Nextel-branded phone service to 1.8 million customers in rural and mid-tier markets.

Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile network operator, agreed to buy another two regional affiliates for 
$714.5m, in a move that will reduce the threat of long-running legal battles with regional affiliates which had 
opposed its $36bn merger. 
The company is acquiring Gulf Coast Wireless for $287.5m, including an unspecified amount of debt, and IWO 
Holdings for $427m, including $20m of net debt. As part of the latest agreement, Sprint Nextel and Gulf Coast 
said they would seek an immediate stay in their litigation. 
Gulf Coast had filed a lawsuit over the Sprint-Nextel transaction. 
Affiliates such as Alamosa Holdings and UbiquiTel also sued to ensure the Sprint-Nextel deal would not increase 
competition and hurt sales. 
Sprint Nextel has moved quickly in recent months to resolve a string of legal disputes with affiliates that resell 
wireless services, mostly stemming from its merger. 
Ahead of the merger, which was completed this month, Sprint bought affiliate US Unwired for $1.03bn after the 
company asked a judge to block the deal. 
Last month Sprint Nextel reached a five-month agreement with some affiliates, including iPCS, that puts lawsuits 
on hold while the companies renegotiate their partnership. Sprint Nextel promised not to compete with affiliates. 
The latest purchases will add more than 332,000 customers. 
The next big hurdle for Gary Forsee, chief executive, will be with Nextel Partners. The affiliate, which had an 
agreement with Nextel under which it could force Sprint Nextel to buy the company, is fighting over how to set the 
price. 
Analysts believe that Sprint Nextel could end up paying as much as $14bn buying affiliates.

affiliates. US Unwired served more than 500,000 customers, mostly in the South. Other notable Sprint affiliates 
include Alamosa Holdings Inc. (APCS), iPCS and UbiquiTel. 
Since Foresee took over Sprint in 2003, he has sought to patch up relationships with its affiliates so the company 
could focus its main energy on battling larger rivals Cingular Wireless and Verizon Wireless. 
Sprint and Nextel completed their $35 billion merger in mid-August now trades under the new symbol S, which 
used to belong to the former Sears Roebuck & Co. On Monday, Sprint (S) shares rose 19 cents to close at 
$25.58. 
Nextel has similar business ties with Nextel Partners (NXTP), a Kirkland, Wash.-based affiliate that holds a "put" 
option requiring Sprint Nextel to buy out the company. 
Nextel Partners has said it intends to exercise that option, which could cost Sprint as much as $5 billion. The

WASHINGTON (XFN-ASIA) -- Sprint Nextel Corp. said Tuesday it would acquire two small affiliates for a 
combined $714 million, as part of a broader effort to iron out contractual differences with its wireless partners. 
Sprint said it would pay $427 million, or $42.50 a share, in cash for IWO Holdings Inc., of Albany, N.Y., including 
the assumption of $208 million in debt. At the same time, the company agreed to acquire Gulf Coast Wireless of 
Baton Rouge, La., in a deal valued at $287.5 million. 
IWO, which posted $187 million in sales in 2004, serves 237,000 customers in upstate New York, Pennsylvania 
and New England. Gulf Coast Wireless, which caters to 95,000 subscribers in southern Louisiana and 
Mississippi, generated $88 million in revenue last year. 
Sprint has nine affiliates that use the Sprint brand and sell wireless service, mostly in rural areas. 
Many affiliates were on course to compete with Sprint in the wake of the company's recently completed $35 billion 
acquisition of Nextel. The affiliates have exclusive rights to sell Sprint-branded service in their territories, but 
Nextel also operates in those areas. 
To solve the problem, Sprint has been seeking to renegotiate contracts with affiliates or to buy them outright. 
"Acquisition is one solution, but it's not the only solution," spokesman Nick Sweers said. 
In its purchase of IWO, Sprint paid the equivalent of 10.8 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortization, based on the 12 months that ended on June 30 and excluding onetime items. The company paid 
9.2 times for Gulf Coast Wireless on a similar basis. 
In an interview two weeks ago, Sprint Chief Executive Gary Forsee told MarketWatch that the company might 
acquire partners that wanted to end the relationship. He said agreements with the rest of its affiliates should be 
completed within a few months. 
Earlier this summer, Sprint paid $1.3 billion to acquire US Unwired Inc. , the second largest of Sprint's affiliates. 
US Unwired served more than 500,000 customers, mostly in the South. 
Other notable Sprint affiliates include Alamosa Holdings Inc. , iPCS and UbiquiTel . 
Alamosa stock rose 41 cents to $17.12 and UbiquiTel climbed 58 cents to trade at $8.50, a 7.3% gain. 
Since Foresee took over Sprint in 2003, he has sought to patch up relationships with its affiliates so the company 
could focus its main energy on battling larger rivals like Cingular Wireless and Verizon Wireless. 
Sprint and Nextel completed their merger in mid-August and the combined company now trades under the new 
symbol "S," which used to belong to Sears Roebuck & Co. In early Tuesday action, Sprint shares fell 26 cents to 
$25.32. 
Nextel had similar business ties with Nextel Partners , a Kirkland, Wash. -based affiliate that holds a "put" option

WASHINGTON (XFN-ASIA) - Sprint Nextel Corp. said Wednesday it won't negotiate a buyout of Nextel Partners 
Inc., signaling that it doesn't want to pay the full market value for its rural affiliate. 
Nextel Partners holds a "put" option that requires Sprint to buy out the company, but Sprint's decision indicates 
that the two companies can't agree on a price. 
Sprint could be forced to pay $5 billion or more to buy the portion of Nextel Partners it doesn't already own unless 
outside mediators determine otherwise. Sprint wants to pay significantly less than that. 
Nextel Partners, Kirkland, Wash., sells Nextel-branded phone service to 1. 8 million customers in rural and midtier 
markets. The company's stock has surged 40% since Sprint and Nextel announced their merger in December, 
driven largely by speculation that the company would trigger the put option. 
Sprint and Nextel consummated their $35 billion merger last Friday. 
Clearly, Sprint doesn't want to pay the full markup. At Nextel Partners's stock price, each subscriber would be 
worth nearly double the amount that Sprint paid for each customer of Nextel Communications, according to 
calculations by Pat Comack, an independent analyst at . 
Under the put option, Sprint Nextel and Nextel Partners can each hire an appraiser to determine the "fair market 
value" of Nextel Partners. 
If the two appraisers provide valuations more than 10% apart, a third appraiser would be hired to resolve the 
matter. Sprint said the process could take at least four months, but analysts think it could take a lot longer unless 
the two companies reach an accord. 
"It's going to be a very difficult process," Comack said. 
Sprint spokesman Nick Sweers said "certainly we've had ongoing discussions with all of our affiliates," but he 
declined to characterize the status of talks with Nextel Partners. 
"We just think the appraisal process is best," he said. A Nextel Partners spokeswoman declined to comment. 
On Tuesday, Sprint CEO Gary Forsee said that the newly merged company has plenty of cash to buy out its 
smaller partners if they don't want to continue selling Sprint or Nextel-branded service. Sprint has 10 affiliates. 
"Some of them may want to continue to be affiliates of the new Sprint Nextel," Forsee said in an interview with 
MarketWatch. "Some may want to stop that relationship, and we would go down the path of acquiring them, which 
we have done with US Unwired." Listen to Sprint interview. 
In recent trades, shares of Nextel Partners were up 14 cents at $26.25. Sprint rose 74 cents to $26.60. 
Open dispute 
In June, the board of Nextel Partners said it would recommend to shareholders that they activate the put option 
and sell out to Sprint Nextel. 
A few weeks later, Nextel Partners sued Nextel Communications Inc., which was still independent at the time. 
Nextel Partners argued that it was not given enough input into Nextel's marketing strategy after the company was 
acquired by Sprint.

Page 22 of 43 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Nextel denied the charges and said it had treated Nextel Partners fairly. The case is still pending, and if Nextel 
Partners wins, Sprint could be forced to delay the rollout of a new marketing campaign slated to start as early as 
next month. 
Nextel Partners is dependent on the success of the Nextel brand. Yet that brand is likely to be phased out in long 
run in favor of Sprint. 
Sprint already owns about one-third of Nextel Partners as a result of its acquisition of Nextel. Shares of Nextel 
Partners it doesn't already own are valued roughly at $5 billion. 
In addition, Sprint-Nextel might have to add a premium based on the "fair market value," as determined by an 
independent assessment. 
Last year, Nextel Partners posted a 34% gain in sales to $1.37 billion, with net income of $53.7 million.

WASHINGTON (XFN-ASIA) - Sprint Nextel Corp. said Wednesday it won't negotiate a buyout of Nextel Partners

WASHINGTON (XFN-ASIA) - Sprint Nextel Corp. said Wednesday that it won't negotiate a buyout of Nextel 
Partners Inc. and would instead seek the involvement of outside mediators. 
Nextel Partners holds a so-called "put" option that requires Sprint Nextel to purchase the smaller affiliate, but 
Sprint Nextel's decision suggests that the two companies can't agree to a price. 
Sprint Nextel could be forced to pay $5 billion or more to acquire the portion of Nextel Partners it does not already 
own unless appraisers determine otherwise. Nextel Partners stock has surged 40% since Sprint and Nextel 
announced their merger in December 2004, driven partly by speculation that the company would trigger the put 
option. 
Under the put option, Sprint Nextel and Nextel Partners can each hire an appraiser to determine the "fair market 
value" of Nextel Partners. 
If the two appraisers provide valuations more than 10% apart, a third appraiser would be hired to resolve the 
matter, Sprint said. Sprint said the process could take at least four months. 
Sprint spokesman Nick Sweers said "certainly we've had ongoing discussions with all of our affiliates," but he 
declined to characterize the status of talks with Nextel Partners. 
"We just think the appraisal process is best," he said. A Nextel Partners spokeswoman declined to comment. 
On Tuesday, Sprint CEO Gary Forsee said that the newly merged company has plenty of cash to buy out its 
smaller partners if they don't want to continue selling Sprint or Nextel-branded service. Sprint has 10 affiliates. 
"Some of them may want to continue to be affiliates of the new Sprint Nextel," Forsee said in an interview with 
MarketWatch. "Some may want to stop that relationship, and we would go down the path of acquiring them, which 
we have done with US Unwired." Listen to Sprint interview. 
In recent trades, shares of Nextel Partners were up 14 cents at $26.25. Sprint rose 74 cents to $26.60. 
Open dispute 
In June, the board of Kirkland, Wash.-based Nextel Partners said it would recommend to shareholders that they 
activate the put option and sell out to Sprint Nextel. 
A few weeks later, Nextel Partners sued Nextel Communications Inc., which was still independent at the time. 
Nextel Partners argued that it was not given enough input into Nextel's marketing strategy after the company was 
acquired by Sprint. 
Nextel denied the charges and said it had treated Nextel Partners fairly. The case is still pending, and if Nextel 
Partners wins, Sprint could be forced to delay the rollout of a new marketing campaign slated to start as early as 
next month. 
Sprint and Nextel consummated their $35 billion merger last Friday. 
Nextel Partners sells Nextel-branded phone service in rural and mid-tier markets and is dependent on the 
success of the Nextel brand. Yet that brand is likely to be phased out in long run in favor of Sprint.

Sprint already owns about one-third of Nextel Partners as a result of its acquisition of Nextel. Shares of Nextel 
Partners it doesn't already own are valued roughly at $5 billion. 
In addition, Sprint-Nextel might have to add a premium based on the "fair market value," as determined by an 
independent assessment. 
Last year, Nextel Partners posted a 34% gain in sales to $1.37 billion, with net income of $53.7 million. The 
company serves more than 1.8 million customers.

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones) - Sprint Nextel Corp. said Wednesday it won't negotiate a buyout of Nextel Partners 
Inc., signaling that it doesn't want to pay the full market value for its rural affiliate. 
Nextel Partners holds a so-called "put" option that requires Sprint to buy out the company, but Sprint's decision 
indicates that the two companies can't agree on a price. 
Sprint could be forced to pay $5 billion or more to buy the portion of Nextel Partners it does not already own 
unless outside mediators determine otherwise. Sprint wants to pay significantly less than that. 
Nextel Partners, based in Kirkland, Wash., sells Nextel-branded phone service to 1.8 million customers in rural 
and mid-tier markets. The company's stock has surged 40% since Sprint and Nextel announced their merger in 
December 2004, driven largely by speculation that the company would trigger the put option. 
Sprint and Nextel consummated their $35 billion merger last Friday. 
Clearly, Sprint does not want to pay the full markup. At Nextel Partners's current stock price, each subscriber 
would be worth nearly double the amount that Sprint paid for each customer of Nextel Communications, 
according to calculations by Pat Comack, an independent analyst at . 
Under the put option, Sprint Nextel (S) and Nextel Partners (NXTP) can each hire an appraiser to determine the 
"fair market value" of Nextel Partners. 
If the two appraisers provide valuations more than 10% apart, a third appraiser would be hired to resolve the 
matter. Sprint said the process could take at least four months, but analysts think it could take a lot longer unless 
the two companies reach an accord. 
"It's going to be a very difficult process," Comack said. 
Sprint spokesman Nick Sweers said "certainly we've had ongoing discussions with all of our affiliates," but he 
declined to characterize the status of talks with Nextel Partners. 
"We just think the appraisal process is best," he said. A Nextel Partners spokeswoman declined to comment.

Sprint CFO Sees 2005 Rev Growth Of Low Single Digits 
Sprint CFO Sees 2005 Rev Growth Of Low Single Digits

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Sprint Corp. (FON) saw its second-quarter subscriber growth fall from the first quarter 
as a result of seasonality and aggressive marketing promotions from its competitors, according to the company's 
president. 
Still, Len Lauer, who is also the chief operating officer, said he was "pleased with the momentum we saw in the 
quarter." 
Sprint posted a turnover rate of 2.2%, a four-year low for the company. Its average revenue per user remained 
flat at $62, attributed to a stronger contribution from wireless data revenue, Lauer said during a conference call 
Wednesday to discuss its second-quarter results. 
The Overland Park, Kan., phone company, which is in the process of merging with Nextel Communications Inc. 
(NXTL), said net income rose to $600 million, or 40 cents a share, from $236 million, or 16 cents a share, in the 
year-ago quarter. 
Quarterly revenue rose 4% to $7.11 billion from $6.87 billion last year. 
Sprint Chief Financial Officer Bob Dellinger said he sees 2005 revenue growth in the low single digits, or roughly 
3% to 4%. The company also projected adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 
$8.7 billion to $8.9 billion. [ 07-27-05 0835ET ] 
Chairman and Chief Executive Gary Forsee said the combined company will pay a dividend, but declined to 
specify the amount, saying it would be determined following the merger. 
Sprint's wireless business again increased its contribution to total revenue, Dellinger said. It contributed to 56% of 
revenue in the second quarter, up from 52% a year ago. 
The growth in wireless continues to offset the declines in the wireline business, Dellinger. That's the trend seen 
with most carriers. In addition to wireless voice, data services has become increasingly important to creating 
profitable growth, he added. 
Sprint is pursuing other avenues of growth through partnerships to reach areas it hasn't been previously been 
strong in, he said. As an example, he cited its continuing partnership with the cable providers for their 
Internet-based phone service. 
The company has also increased productivity by 15% as measured by revenue per employee. Sprint has made 
solid progress on expense initiatives, he said. 
On the wireless side, Operating Chief Lauer acknowledged net subscriber additions fell to 588,000 from 897,000 
a year ago. He noted the second quarter is typically weaker for its prepaid service Virgin Mobile. 
Sprint's "Fair and Flexible" continues to be its flagship product, and has been successful in attracting and keeping 
subscribers, Lauer said. 
The flat average revenue per user has bucked the trend of declines from the other wireless carriers. Lauer said 
add-on products and data service revenues helped offset decreased overage charges.

Page 30 of 43 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Sprint is also aggressively deploying its high-speed wireless network, EV-DO, and consumers will be able to use 
the service by the end of the year in several major markets, Lauer said. 
The long-distance business continues to have challenges as consumers migrate to a wireless service. As a result, 
revenue in the segment fell, Lauer said, adding there have been aggressive cost cuts in the area. 
Sprint continues to be selective in capital investments for long distance, choosing to focus on growth areas such 
as Internet phone services. 
The local service business, which will be spun off after the merger with Nextel, saw revenue fall from a year ago, 
as the rate of access line deactivations is greater than activations, said Mike Fuller, president of Sprint's local 
business. 
Adjusted operating income, however, rose due to lower costs and lower-than-expected post-retirement benefit 
expenses. 
The strategy of bundling services, a catalyst for other phone companies, has helped drive growth in DSL and 
long-distance services, Fuller said. 
Sprint will begin regulatory filing for the spin-off shortly after the merger. [ 07-27-05 0910ET ] 
CEO Forsee declined to comment on the prospect of acquiring or renegotiating deals with Sprint's affiliates. The 
carrier earlier this month agreed to acquire US Unwired Inc. (UNWR). 
"It will be an affiliate-by-affiliate discussion," he said. 
Forsee said it was premature to comment on how Sprint would integrate US Unwired. He did note there was 
some cost reduction opportunity from the back office. 
"To go beyond that is inappropriate," he said. 
The US Unwired acquisition settled litigation between the two companies. After US Unwired, several affiliates 
sued the company in an effort to secure their exclusive agreements.

Sprint Corp.'s pending acquisition of Nextel Communications Inc. has become a virtual soap opera, with 
numerous tit-for-tats that have cropped up ahead of the deal's expected closing later this quarter. The issues are 
not expected to thwart the deal's final outcome, though they could require Sprint to solve matters more quickly 
than originally anticipated. 
Sprint cleared an important hurdle by announcing plans to purchase unhappy affiliate US Unwired Inc. for $1.3 
billion. US Unwired, which serves more than 500,000 Sprint customers in nine states covering 8.1 million 
potential customers, was in the midst of a court case attempting to block Sprint's acquisition of Nextel, citing the 
deal's potential violation of US Unwired's affiliate agreement. Not to be outdone, iPCS Inc. late Friday filed its 
own lawsuit against Sprint, citing similar alleged violations as US Unwired's case. 
Under terms of the deal, Sprint said it plans to acquire all of US Unwired's outstanding common stock for $6.25 
per share. US Unwired's stock was trading up at around $6.20 last week, giving the affiliate a market 
capitalization of about $1.02 billion. 
Sprint noted that after the tender offer, any remaining US Unwired shares would be acquired in a cash merger at 
the same price, and it would assume US Unwired's $266 million in net debt. Shareholders controlling about 27.3 
percent of US Unwired's common stock have agreed to tender their shares pursuant to the tender offer and to 
vote in favor of the acquisition, which is expected to close during the third quarter. 
``This acquisition would bring an end to a long partnership with the management and shareholders of US 
Unwired,'' said Gary Forsee, Sprint chairman and chief executive officer. ``We appreciate their efforts over the 
years to grow the Sprint business in its assigned territories. While we decided to acquire a direct ownership 
interest in these assets, we continue to value our relationship with other affiliates providing Sprint services.'' 
More importantly for Sprint, the agreement also calls for both parties to seek an immediate stay of litigation 
pending in the U.S. District Court in US Unwired's hometown of Lake Charles, La. 
US Unwired said in previous court filings that the pending acquisition would irreparably harm the affiliate and 
violate portions of its 1998 affiliate agreement, which prevents Sprint from offering a competitive service in any of 
US Unwired's 11 service areas. US Unwired claims that with the acquisition of Nextel, Sprint would have 
operations in nine of US Unwired's service areas. 
While Sprint managed to solve its US Unwired problem, affiliate UbiquiTel Inc. filed its own lawsuit to prevent 
Sprint from competing against the affiliate in its markets following the Nextel acquisition. 
UbiquiTel claimed that Sprint's planned purchase of Nextel will violate its affiliate agreement as the combined 
operations plan to use Nextel's existing infrastructure, licenses and network to augment Sprint's network in 
UbiquiTel's service area. 
UbiquiTel also said that the Sprint Nextel operations plan to begin selling newly branded Sprint services in former 
Nextel retail outlets that will be rebranded as Sprint Nextel stores. In support of its claim, UbiquiTel said that 
during a conference call with its affiliates late last month, Sprint stated its goal was for both Sprint and Nextel to 
sell both companies' products and services the first day after the acquisition is complete. 
UbiquiTel added that Nextel's ongoing spectrum relocation process with the Federal Communications 
Commission would further violate its affiliate agreement. The FCC plan will provide Nextel with 10 megahertz of 
spectrum in the 1.9 GHz spectrum band in exchange for some of Nextel's 800 MHz spectrum holdings and nearly

Page 32 of 43 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
$5 billion in cash and related expenses. UbiquiTel said its affiliate agreement prevents Sprint from offering a 
competing service using the 1.9 GHz spectrum bands in UbiquiTel's service areas. 
UbiquiTel said it is licensed by Sprint to provide services in portions of California, Nevada, Washington, Idaho, 
Wyoming, Utah, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, serving more than 413,000 Sprint wireless customers. 
The UbiquiTel complaint also alleges ``tortuous interference'' by Nextel in improperly interfering with the affiliate's 
exclusive rights under the affiliate agreement. UbiquiTel claims that Nextel was aware that its acquisition by Sprint 
would violate the affiliate agreement with Sprint, but Nextel ``intentionally caused Sprint to execute the merger 
agreement-a significant factor giving rise to the imminent breach of the management agreement.'' 
Sprint noted in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that both Sprint and Nextel plan to defend the 
allegations. 
UbiquiTel said it was seeking a court judgement to force Sprint to comply with the exclusivity provisions of its 
affiliate agreement and prevent Sprint from disclosing confidential UbiquiTel business information to any person 
involved in operating or managing Nextel's business operations in UbiquiTel's markets; using Nextel's 
infrastructure, licenses or network to provide Sprint coverage or sell Sprint products and services in UbiquiTel's 
service areas; using the Sprint brand to sell wireless services in UbiquiTel's service areas; and from owning, 
operating, building or managing a wireless network using Nextel's 1.9 GHz spectrum in UbiquiTel's service areas. 
Sprint said in its SEC 8-K filing that it had discussed possible revisions of UbiquiTel's affiliate agreement ahead of 
its acquisition of Nextel, and it expected those discussions to continue. 
Analysts have predicted Sprint probably would roll up its remaining affiliates in connection with the Nextel deal, 
citing the potential violation of their affiliate agreements. UbiquiTel has a market capitalization of $850 million, 
while larger affiliate Alamosa Holdings Inc. is valued at more than $2.5 billion. 
Nextel has a similar dilemma with its affiliate Nextel Partners Inc., which began legal proceedings earlier this 
month in New York, seeking a stay in the Sprint acquisition of Nextel, pending amendments to its affiliate 
agreement. Nextel Partners' claims are centered around a recent Sprint branding announcement to use the Sprint 
name for the combined Sprint Nextel operations and Nextel Partners' possible use of the name for its own 
operations. 
The Nextel Partners' issues are not expected to impede Sprint's acquisition of Nextel as Nextel Partners' 
management has said it will encourage its shareholders to vote in favor of the deal and subsequently enact a put 
option that would force Nextel to acquire the 68 percent of Nextel Partners it does not already own. 
Nextel also last week questioned the value of its affiliate in relation to the put option. In an SEC filing, Nextel 
stated that Nextel Partners' put option should not be tied directly to Nextel Partners current market price, which 
has increased more than 40 percent since the deal was announced late last year. Nextel Partners is valued at 
more than $6.5 billion. 
Nextel cited Nextel Partners' current trading value metrics as being ``the highest in the industry by a significant 
margin'' as a reason that the appraisal value ``could be lower, and we think should be lower'' than its current 
trading price of $24.50 per share. Nextel noted that its affiliate's current enterprise value as a multiple of Wall 
Street 2005 estimates and enterprise value per subscriber is more than twice Nextel's value despite Nextel 
generating more operating income before depreciation and amortization per subscriber than Nextel Partners. 
Nextel also reported that if Nextel Partners triggers its put option following the closing of Sprint's acquisition of 
Nextel, which Nextel Partners' management has said it will recommend to its shareholders, the process could 
take at least four months to complete. 
Nextel's argument found little support among some analysts, who continue to feel Nextel Partners' put rights will 
garner a substantial premium. ``We expect the valuation battle to rage on for awhile, but believe [the] final price, 
including control premium, will be above current levels,'' said Raymond James & Associates telecom industry 
analyst Ric Prentiss in a research note. 
Despite the affiliate cat fights, Sprint and Nextel shareholders threw their support behind the deal, overwhelmingly 
voting in favor of the acquisition. Sprint reported at least 96 percent of its shares were voted in favor of the deal, 
while Nextel said it garnered a positive vote from 99.8 percent of its outstanding shares.

The acquisition is still waiting approval from the FCC and Department of Justice. FCC staff members have 
reportedly recommended approval of the deal, which is expected to close next month.

Sprint, Nextel shareholders OK merger

At their annual meetings yesterday, Sprint and Nextel Communications shareholders overwhelmingly threw their 
support behind the two companies pending acquisition. At least 96% of Sprint shareholders backed their 
companies $36 billion acquisition plan, while Nextels shareholders supported the deal with 99.8% of the vote. 
While both groups of shareholders were expected to back the deal, the official votes now clear one of the final 
hurdles to the pending deal, which would create the countrys third mega-carrier behind Cingular and Verizon 
Wireless. The companies must still get approval from the FCC and the U.S. Justice Department as well as from 
the state regulators where Sprints ILEC arm holds local franchises. But to offset any concern on that front, Sprint 
is proposing to spin off its local business into a separate wireline company, which would be the largest non-RBOC 
local provider with 7.6 million access lines. 
The Sprint and Nextel merger is a bold move that will allow the new company to play a winning hand, Chairman 
and CEO Gary Forsee said in his address to the shareholders. Together, we will be a well-positioned 
communications company, with unmatched wireless capabilities and a global IP network. 
Forsee said that talks between himself, regulators and his Nextel counterpart Tim Donahue have gone well and 
the company is not expecting any major problems to interfere with proposed third-quarter timeline for closing the 
deal. 
I am very pleased with our current status with the appropriate regulatory bodies, Forsee said. The Federal 
Communications Commission and Department of Justice approval process is on track, and we expect to 
complete the merger in the third quarter of this year. 
Despite the two companies good cheer, Sprint has been having trouble with its affiliates since it announced the 
acquisition. On Monday it settled a dispute with US Unwired, which was seeking to block the acquisition because 
of its exclusive deal over Sprints brand in markets where Nextel has service. Sprint got US Unwired to withdraw 
its injunction request by buying the southern operator for $1.3 billion. Today, however, another affiliate, Ubiquitel, 
filed suit claiming the merger would violate its own exclusivity agreements with Sprint. But Ubiquitel is not seeking 
to block the deal, like US Wireless attempted.

Sprint Corp., yesterday announced its plans to acquire La.-based US Unwired -- a wireless telco that provides 
Sprint PCS services in nine states to more than 500,000 direct wireless subscribers in 48 markets -- for about 
$1.3 billion. 
As part of the agreement, Sprint and US Unwired will seek an immediate stay of litigation pending in U.S. District 
Court in Lake Charles, La., including US Unwired's request for an injunction to block the merger of Sprint and 
Nextel Communications, with a final resolution to become effective upon the closing of the acquisition. 
"This acquisition would bring an end to a long partnership with the management and shareholders of US 
Unwired," said Gary Forsee, chairman and CEO for Sprint. "We appreciate their efforts over the years to grow 
the Sprint business in its assigned territories. While we decided to acquire a direct ownership interest in these 
assets, we continue to value our relationship with other affiliates providing Sprint services." 
Robert Piper, US Unwired's president and CEO, said, "we began our Sprint relationship with a handful of 
customers and a service territory of 1.8 million residents. Through the effort of our personnel, our network now 
covers 8.1 million people and serves more than a half-million subscribers."

(Adds executive quotes, share price update) 
Sinead Carew 
NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - Sprint Corp. is expecting rapid regulatory approval of its $36.4 billion proposal to 
buy Nextel Communications Inc. , Sprint's Chief Executive Officer Gary Forsee said on Tuesday. 
"Whether it's July or August we certainly expect it to be approved in short order," Forsee said in an interview. 
Nextel and Sprint have said they hoped the Department of Justice and the Federal Communication Commission 
would approve the deal around August. 
Forsee said he was encouraged by the regulators' approval of smaller rival Alltel Corp.'s plan to buy Western 
Wireless for about $4.7 billion in the last week. 
Recent questions from the Justice Department were related to Sprint's Monday announcement of plans to buy 
one of its affiliates US Unwired Inc. for $1.3 billion, Forsee said. 
But he said Sprint isn't aware of any major issue that could stall approval of the merger and noted that the "the 
level of questions" from both agencies is "starting to diminish." 
Forsee said he also expects Sprint's shareholders to approve the deal. Sprint and Nextel shareholders are 
scheduled to vote on the merger on July 13. 
Forsee said he expects the company to spend about two to four weeks after the deal closes training employees 
and planning for the market launch of a combined Sprint Nextel. 
He said the company, which has already said the deal would result in some layoffs, expects any job cuts to be 
part of a gradual process of combining the two companies. 
"Those decisions are going to play out over two to three years," Forsee said without disclosing how many jobs 
could be affected. 
The company's biggest rival Cingular Wireless, a venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth Corp. , said it 
would reduce its workforce by 10 percent. 
The combined company is expected to have about 60,000 employees after it spins off Sprint's local telephone 
business early next year. Sprint currently has about 60,000 employees and Nextel has roughly 17,000 workers. 
It has said it expects the deal to generate about $12 billion in savings. 
Forsee said the combined company's main focus going forward would be the expansion of data and media 
services such as the delivery of everything from e-mail to video to mobile phones. 
"Voice is certainly how the business was built in the past. The future is going to be about data services," Forsee 
said. 
Like long distance telephone networks, wireless networks will eventually carry more data than voice traffic, he 
said.

Page 37 of 43 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"We're positioning our company to take advantage of that," he added. 
Sprint had said on Monday that it planned to buy one of its 10 affiliates US Unwired. It has been in talks with its 
affiliates about restructuring their relationships as the Nextel deal could breach agreements about exclusive use 
of Sprint's brand in markets where affiliates and Nextel operate. 
Forsee said Sprint still hopes to continue its affiliate program into the future but would not say when he expects to 
be able to announce any restructuring agreements. 
Sprint shares closed down 13 cents at $25.32 on the New York Stock Exchange. Nextel stock was down 19 cents 
at $32.80 on Nasdaq.

Sprint, the US mobile network operator, has launched a Dollars 1.3bn tender offer for US Unwired, a Sprint 
affiliate that resells Sprint services and has more than 500,000 subscribers. 
The move comes as Sprint pushes ahead with its pending Dollars 35bn acquisition of Nextel Communications 
and will extend Sprint's direct service territory to an additional 6m people. "This acquisition would bring an end to 
a long partnership with the management and shareholders of US Unwired," said Gary Forsee, Sprint's chief 
executive. 
Under the terms of the agreement, recommended by both boards, Sprint will launch a cash tender offer to acquire 
all of US Unwired's outstanding common stock at Dollars 6.25 per share. Sprint also will acquire US Unwired's 
net debt, about Dollars 266m. Sprint and US Unwired have agreed to halt litigation pending in the US courts.

Sprint Corp., the No. 3 U.S. mobile-phone carrier, agreed to buy US Unwired Inc. for $1.3 billion US to silence a 
critic that had sued to block Sprint's planned purchase of Nextel Communications Inc. 
US Unwired holders will receive $6.25 a share in cash, Sprint said Monday in a statement. US Unwired, which 
sells wireless services under the Sprint brand, asked a federal court to block the Sprint-Nextel deal in June. 
Monday's agreement will end that litigation, the companies said. 
The US Unwired purchase helps Sprint chief executive Gary Forsee smooth the way for the $35-billion Nextel 
acquisition. US Unwired, which had said the Sprint-Nextel combination would put it in competition with Overland 
Park, Kan.-based Sprint, is selling for 42 per cent more than the company was worth before the Sprint-Nextel deal 
was announced. 
"Their main agenda was to get Sprint to purchase them," said Thomas Watts, a telecommunications analyst at 
SG Cowen & Co. in New York. He said Sprint is among his top picks. 
Sprint is paying 1.5 per cent more than US Unwired's July 8 closing price. US Unwired shares rose four cents to 
$6.20 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. Sprint shares rose seven cents to 
$25.45 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading and have risen 2.4 per cent this year. 
Investors with about 27 per cent of US Unwired stock already have agreed to tender the shares, Sprint said. The 
acquisition probably will be completed in the third quarter, Sprint said. 
Nextel would help Sprint become a bigger competitor of Cingular Wireless LLC and Verizon Wireless, the two 
largest U.S. mobile-phone carriers.

OVERLAND PARK, Kan. and LAKE CHARLES, La., July 11 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Sprint and US Unwired, 
Inc. today announced that their boards of directors have unanimously approved an agreement for Sprint to 
acquire US Unwired for approximately $1.3 billion. 
(Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20001013/SPRINTLOGO ) 
Under the terms of the agreement, Sprint will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of US Unwired's 
outstanding common stock at a price of $6.25 per share. Following completion of the tender offer, any remaining 
shares of US Unwired will be acquired in a cash merger at the same price. Sprint also will acquire US Unwired's 
net debt, which was approximately $266 million as of March 31, 2005, in connection with the transaction. 
Shareholders with approximately 27.3% of the outstanding common shares of US Unwired have agreed to tender 
their shares pursuant to the tender offer and to vote their shares in favor of the merger. The acquisition is subject 
to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2005. 
As part of the agreement, Sprint and US Unwired will seek an immediate stay of litigation pending in U.S. District 
Court in Lake Charles, La., including US Unwired's request for an injunction to block the merger of Sprint and 
Nextel Communications, with a final resolution to become effective upon the closing of the acquisition. 
US Unwired, based in Lake Charles, La., provides Sprint PCS services in nine states, serving more than 500,000 
direct wireless subscribers in 48 markets. It employs about 600 people and had 2004 revenues of $408 million. 
"This acquisition would bring an end to a long partnership with the management and shareholders of US 
Unwired," said Gary Forsee, chairman and CEO, Sprint. "We appreciate their efforts over the years to grow the 
Sprint business in its assigned territories. While we decided to acquire a direct ownership interest in these assets, 
we continue to value our relationship with other affiliates providing Sprint services." 
Robert Piper, US Unwired's president and CEO, said: "Since US Unwired's inception, our employees have 
demonstrated their commitment to building substantial shareholder value. We began our Sprint relationship with a 
handful of customers and a service territory of 1.8 million residents. Through the effort of our personnel, our 
network now covers 8.1 million people and serves more than a half-million subscribers. We are pleased to have 
this opportunity to realize continued value for our shareholders."

Sprint today surmounted an obstacle to its merger with Nextel Communications, announcing it would purchase 
the Louisiana wireless affiliate seeking to block the $36 billion deal. 
Sprint announced it would purchase US Unwired for $1.3 billion and assume the carriers $266 million debt. In 
exchange, US Unwired is dropping its court actions against Sprint to stop the Nextel-Sprint merger and settle a 
billing dispute between the carriers. Based in Lake Charles, La., US Unwired operates affiliate networks in 48 
markets in the South using Sprint name. The networks serve about 500,000 Sprint customers and covers 1.8 
million pops where Sprint has no infrastructure of its own. But the Nextel acquisition, expected to close this year, 
would give Sprint iDEN infrastructure in many of its affiliate markets, creating a situation where Sprint would be 
essentially competing against its own brand. 
Sprint has been in talks with its affiliates since announcing the Nextel deal, which could lead to Sprint breaking or 
altering its affiliate deals with as many as nine carriers. US Unwired was the only carrier to seek a court 
injunction against the Sprint-Nextel deal, but the acquisition deal brokered by the companies could lead other 
affiliates to try their luck in court. 
This acquisition would bring an end to a long partnership with the management and shareholders of US 
Unwired, Sprint CEO and chairman Gary Forsee said in a statement. We appreciate their efforts over the years 
to grow the Sprint business in its assigned territories. While we decided to acquire direct ownership in these 
assets, we continue to value our relationship with other affiliates providing Sprint services. 
Sprint gave no indication of what it would do with US Unwired PCS assets after the Nextel acquisition is 
complete. Presumably, since both Nextel and Sprint use separate cellular technologies, Sprint would continue to 
operate the US Unwired networks for its CDMA customers and the Nextels infrastructure for iDEN customers. 
The combined company, however, is expected to eventually migrate to a melded CDMA architecture. 
Sprint has agreed to buy all of US Unwireds outstanding stock at $6.25 per share. Shareholders with about 
27.3% of the outstanding stock have all agreed to the offer and have committed to vote their shares in favor of the 
acquisition, which Sprint expects to close in the third quarter.
