Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, is the only contender left in negotiations to buy Hambrecht &Quist, the 
San Francisco-based investment bank, after other potential buyers baulked at the price. 
Merrill is thought to be poised to pay up to $50 a share, or a total of about $1.3bn, representing about four times 
book value. At the end of April, H&Q's shares traded as low as $16, but yesterday they closed at $43 1/2, down 
$1 1/2, or 3.33%, on the day. 
Several investment banks are known to have talked to H&Q, including Societe Generale, the French bank. 
However, all but Merrill Lynch have since pulled out. 
SocGen and its advisers yesterday declined to comment. One investment banker involved in talks with H&Q said 
that Merrill's apparent willingness to pay up "might be seen as a sign that things are beginning to get a little loose 
at Merrill Anything over $45 a share cannot be economically justified. It is, after all, a big price to pay to look 
foolish." 
Last month Merrill agreed to pay $5.3bn for Mercury Asset Management, the UK's leading fund management 
group. This represented 3% of MAM's funds under management, at the top end of deals in the sector over the 
past few years, and was justified by David Komansky, Merrill chairman and chief executive, as helping fulfil 
Merrill's effort to be a global leader in asset management. 
H&Q is a technology-focused investment bank, where Merrill is relatively weak. However the investment banker 
said Merrill's decision to pursue H&Q was surprising given that its most urgent need was for technology focused 
research staff and brokers rather than traders and sales staff. 
Merrill refused to comment yesterday and H&Q did not return calls. A person close to the talks suggested the 
companies had been discussing a partial sale, giving Merrill majority control of H&Q but reducing the price. 
Analysts yesterday played down the potential dangers to Merrill of overpaying. "It would be more of a concern if 
the acquisition were larger," said Raphael Soifer, analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. 
He said the Merrill acquisition of MAM was "the sort of deal that analysts used to hate. It will be years before 
MAM pays for itself at that price but strategically it was something they needed and the stock price went up." 
Other analysts said Merrill needed extra fire power in technology underwriting where it has lagged behind 
competitors such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, both US investment banks. "When you think about all 
the Silicon valleys around the world, Merrill should be able to translate that into business," said Michael Lipper of 
Lipper Analytical.

US giant Merrill Lynch's #3.1bn takeover bid for Mercury Asset Management has sparked fears that 
independent fund management in the UK may come to an end. 
The deal, unveiled last week, will create Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management, whose total funds under 
management will be #266bn. 
But the move has created concern that other foreign banks and investment houses may swoop on the remain ing 
independent UK fund managers. 
Chase de Vere investment director Graham Hooper says: "I do wonder about what will happen to Perpetual. They 
are independently owned and they have a very good track record." 
Perpetual, which is 40 per cent owned by Martyn Arbib, has consistently denied it is for sale. 
BESt Investments director Jason Hollands says: "It is going to be a big challenge to the independent sector in the 
UK." 
He says Merrill Lynch has a large retail operation selling mutual funds in the US and believes it is likely they will 
be looking at a major UK retail move through MAM. 
MLMAM will be jointly headed by top MAM fund managers Carol Galley and Stephen Zimmerman. 
MAM chairman Hugh Stevenson will oversee the merger for a year as non-executive chairman. 
MAM will continue to trade under the same name in the UK and insists it will keep control of fund management. 
Merrill Lynch chairman and chief executive David Komansky says: "We will have a leading position in asset 
management in the UK and the US and a strong platform for fut-ure growth in every region of the world."

Scotland on Sunday

(c) 1997 
Andrew Garfield. 
'CITY ice maiden gets #10m boost,' screamed the headlines last week after the thundering herd, as US 
investment banking giant Merrill Lynch is universally known, stormed into the City and carried off the scalp of 
Mercury Asset Management, the Rolls-Royce of City fund managers, for #3.1bn. 
News that Carol Galley, the City's richest woman, and 10 of MAM's senior directors, including its Scots-born 
chairman Hugh Stevenson and deputy chairman Stephen Zimmerman, were to share in a #40m bonanza 
provoked an inevitable bout of sniping about City fat cats. "New Labour, same old fat cats," complained one 
columnist on Thursday. 
Rivals were full of admiration - once they could get over their irritation at having failed to get even a whiff of the 
deal before it was announced. 
For the fund managers who form the core of the City, this one deal has utterly changed the rules of the game. For 
the dwindling band of Scottish investment managers, still reeling after this year's takeover of Scottish Amicable by 
the Pru, the implications are worrying indeed. What the Merrill bid for MAM is saying is not so much that the Scots 
are vulnerable to takeover, but that Edinburgh is now simply being bypassed altogether. 
"It is very smart. Dammit," said Ian Watt at Edinburgh Fund Managers. "It has raised the deal for everybody in the 
UK." The gap between the top tier of players with genuine global pretensions and niche operators has overnight 
widened dramatically, leaving even Standard Life, with its #50bn under management, looking decidedly 
second-rate. As for the next tier down with less than #20bn of assets, we are looking, said Watts, at "the killing 
zone". 
The Scots are only just starting to get into the pension management business and are nowhere in global terms. 
Watts added: "Edinburgh is going to wither on the vine. But it is not just an issue for Scotland but for the UK fund 
management industry as a whole. A lot of people will be having to go back to the drawing board." 
Last week saw a huge jump in the shares in all the big quoted fund management groups, as investors placed their 
bets on who might be next. M&G, long regarded as a favourite target, saw its shares jump 160p to #13.35 on 
Wednesday after the MAM deal was announced. 
Interest has inevitably focused, too, on Perpetual, Martyn Arbib's fast-growing fund management group, which 
Merrill is believed to have talked to before deciding upon MAM, and Henderson, another great name of the past 
which is now likely to go. 
THE big question, though, is what about Schroders and Robert Fleming? These are the two brand-names which 
are up there with MAM as UK fund managers with an international reputation. They will now be wondering how 
they should deal with the flood of approaches from potential bidders which they will inevitably receive. 
There would be no shortage of buyers. MAM, it was widely known, had been talking on and off with Allianz, the 
giant German insurance group, about joint deals in continental Europe. Allianz is currently concentrating on 
France, where it has just entered the bidding fray for insurer AGF. But it cannot ignore what is going on in the UK. 
Merrill's rivals on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who have been watching Merrill whittle away 
their lead in the global investment banking stakes, will also be spending this weekend trying to digest the 
implications of the deal.

Page 7 of 63 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Their problem up to now has been the lack of really good names who are prepared to sell. Fund management is a 
people business par excellence, and no one wants to buy a business over the heads of those who have made it 
successful and watch them all leave. 
After one of the longest-running bull markets in recent memory, everyone's performance tables are looking good. 
But the recent stockmarket jitters have given a timely warning of mortality. Fund managers all admit that the 
markets are not going to get any easier. Indeed less than a fortnight ago, Stevenson was warning the City that 
MAM's shareholders cannot expect that the 20% returns they have become used to will last forever. Clearly if you 
are going to sell, better now that in a year's time, when the figures may not look so rosy. 
David Komansky, Merrill's chairman, would have no truck last week with the inevitable carping that this was a 
top-of-the-market deal. At 25 times earnings, Merrill is paying a very full price, and one which few others are 
going to want to try and trump. But then Merrill was accused of overpaying two years ago when it bought Smith 
New Court, then the UK's strongest broking house, and Komansky knows full well that when it comes to a 
business like MAM, you do not get a second chance. "This is the crown jewel in global asset management," he 
said. "It is exactly what we've been waiting for." 
From MAM's point of view it is a very good deal indeed. Stevenson admitted last week that MAM had looked at 
expanding into the US off its own bat but had failed to find a suitable US house to buy. This way the company 
gets access to Merrill's asset base and the extensive retail franchise it enjoys in the domestic US market. 
Just as importantly the MAM top brass get access to Merrill's information technology expertise at a time when 
asset management is becoming an increasingly technology-driven business. And they get to keep their jobs. 
Mercury, already the strongest brand name in investment management in the UK, has been looking to expand 
into continental Europe, where funded pensions are at last taking off, and Japan, where the big bang financial 
deregulation is opening up a huge new market to western firms for the first time. It will be far easier to prise open 
these markets with the global backing of a firm of Merrill's size. 
WHERE the doubts creep in, as inevitably they do, is over the issue of cultures meshing. At the televised 
transatlantic press conference last week to publicise the deal, Stevenson and Komansky were singing from the 
same song book, stressing how long the two firms have known each other and how close in philosophy and 
outlook they are. 
But one only had to listen to the contrast between Komansky's street-wise Bronx tones and Stevenson's plummy 
accent to sense where the seeds of potential friction lie. Carol Galley aside, Mercury people are, as one City 
insider put it last week, "the kind who ask for permission to remove their jackets and speak like Prince Charles". 
At Merrill, "they think such behaviour is only for what I believe they call the Limey fags like Rupert Everett", he 
said. 
Stevenson fought for and secured assurances that Mercury would remain independent and be run from London. 
These will last as long as they are useful to both sides. 
Clearly, you do not pay the kind of money that Merrill is forking out and then deliberately destroy what you buy. 
But there is an unmistakable feeling that this deal may be seen with hindsight to have marked a crossroads - and 
not just for Mercury alone but for the UK financial sector as a whole. Over the last few years, the merchant banks 
who were once the pillars of the City have either been snapped up by foreign banks with deeper pockets and 
longer-suffering shareholders than their British competitors, or have simply been elbowed out of the way. 
Fund management has, however, remained a largely British preserve. Run like a cottage industry, it is full of 
talented, highly-paid but often prickly individuals. Management, in the conventional sense of keeping these 
individuals pulling together, is, as often in UK industry, its Achilles heel. 
The huge inflow of funds, which the industry confidently expects to see over the coming decades as an ageing 
population finds itself setting aside more and more of its money for retirement, could prove to be a mixed 
blessing. Managing funds on that scale is going to require industrial-scale processes, more technology, more 
marketing, economies of scale - all things that the traditional fund manager would look down on and all areas 
where British companies have traditionally been poor performers. 
THE explosion of passively-managed tracker funds is causing more concern to the industry than it is willing to 
admit. Richard Branson, whose Virgin Direct has won more than #1bn of business since it opened shop, has 
made a virtue of not employing fund managers, relying on index-tracking funds instead. Branson says he has 
studied the performance tables and concluded that over the period, fund managers underperform, whatever 
targets they are set. It is an unpalatable truth but one which it is hard to avoid.

If the government achieves its goal of widening the savings net to include the majority of ordinary citizens who do 
not save, the business is going to go to those who can offer cheap no-nonsense products and manage large 
masses of money in the most cost-effective way. The City of London has received a wake-up call and it remains 
to be seen how it will respond.

European asset management is set to boom, say Richard Miles and Jon Ashworth 
When Mercury Asset Management announced its interim results on November 6, Hugh Stevenson, the 
chairman, gave no hint of the momentous deal that was in the offing. Yet we now know that he had already begun 
detailed negotiations with Merrill Lynch, one of Wall Street's biggest banks. 
Indeed, yesterday's disclosure of Merrill Lynch's friendly #3.1bn offer for MAM took everyone by surprise. In 
spite of more than two years of speculation over the future of the UK's leading fund manager, dealers did not 
even get a whiff of the acquisition. City analysts were said to be so stunned that they posed not a single question 
to the management of the two companies when formally told of the deal yesterday morning. 
From MAM's point of view, this appears to be an outstanding deal. Coming at a time when the one-time darling of 
the City was starting to look a bit tarnished - the performance of its main pooled pension fund has been heavily 
criticised in recent months - an acquisiton price that equates to a 32% premium on Tuesday's closing share price 
must seem like manna from heaven. 
And amid accelerating consolidation in financial services, the deal comes with no redundancies and a pledge 
from Merrill Lynch that MAM will be allowed to keep its independence when making investment decisions, and 
its own name in the UK. This attitude is in marked contrast to Merrill's 1995 takeover of Smith New Court, the UK 
stockbroker, when it dropped the old English name, much to the consternation of some City old-timers. 
Quite whether the deal is such good value for Merrill Lynch remains a moot point. Many City analysts believe 
that the price is excessive, particularly when the world's stock markets are going through a patch of distinct 
volatility. Only two or three weeks ago, David Komansky, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch, gave 
warning that the markets had much further to fall, perhaps up to 15%. 
On a funds basis, the picture is more positive. Merrill Lynch is paying a price equivalent to 3% of the funds under 
management, comparing unfavourably to the 1.9% that NatWest paid for Gartmore, though it looks good against 
the 4.2% that Commerzbank paid for Jupiter Tyndall. Dealers speculated last night that NatWest may now hive off 
Gartmore to unlock some of the hidden value in the fund manager. 
"Merrill Lynch faces a tall order," said Robin Down, a financial analyst at ABN Amro Hoare Govett. According to 
Mr Down, the terms of the deal mean a 4% return on equity for the US invest ment bank, against a target of 9 or 
10%. "That means MAM has to double funds under management, or double its profitability," he said. 
Merrill Lynch argues, however, that the whole deal will add up to more than the sum of the parts. The combined 
strengths of the two - Merrill's capital and distribution network, MAM's investment management track record and 
client base - should boost annual growth. In one bound, Merrill Lynch has leapt to become the third-biggest 
asset manager in the world with combined assets of $450bn (#266bn), behind Fidelity and Axa. 
Asset management is particularly attractive to Merrill Lynch for two principal reasons. First, the stability of 
recurring fee income offsets the volatility in revenues from investment banking. Second, asset management will 
be the growth sector in Europe over the next decade as governments withdraw welfare benefits and individuals 
are forced to provide for their own retirement. 
Inevitably, the City's eyes will now focus on the UK fund managers that have clung on to their independence: 
Schroders, M&G, Perpetual and a handful of smaller players. Arthur Zeikel, president and chief executive officer 
of Merrill Lynch Asset Management, made it plain yesterday that the company had held informal talks with just

Page 10 of 63 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
about everyone in the field, both in the UK and on the Continent. "After the most exhaustive analysis, we decided 
Mercury was the best strategic fit," he said. 
But there are plenty more predators out there. Several years ago, Morgan Stanley attempted, unsuccessfully, to 
acquire SG Warburg when the UK bank still owned MAM. Even with its recently announced $21bn merger with 
Dean Witter, Morgan Stanley is said to be still interested in expanding its European asset management business. 
Closer to home, Halifax and Barclays have both made no secret of their desire to acquire a fund manager. 
Rival UK fund management groups were treading a cautious line yesterday. M&G, Britain's oldest unit trust 
manager, with more than 750,000 customers and #18bn under management, was saying little ahead of the 
publication of its full-year results next Thursday. The group said it would not be appropriate to comment on 
market developments ahead of the results, although it would be talking about its place in the industry when the 
numbers come out. 
Once the giant of the unit trust and Pep industry, M&G has been hit by a run of poor performance, which has 
provoked an exodus of private investors. It recently unveiled a planned shake-up of its range of funds, merging 
some, and changing the names of others, in the hope of putting things back on track. In the meantime, it is 
perceived as vulnerable. 
Perpetual, the UK's largest provider of Peps, expressed concern this week about the Government's tinkering with 
private savings, and the proposed individual savings account (Isa) in particular. It was quoted at saying that a 
negative enough scenario could even push it into a merger, although this line was moderated yesterday. What the 
group meant to say was that it would be considering a range of options, of which a merger would be the definite 
last resort. 
Perpetual thinks that the MAM-Merrill tie-up will inevitably lead to greater pressure for consolidation in the UK 
fund management industry - in the same way that merger mania has broken out among the Big Six accounting 
firms. Comparisons can be drawn with America, where a larger market share is being divided between a smaller 
number of product providers. A spokesman said: "You've got to be big to play big." 
In the UK, the market in Peps and pensions is dominated by perhaps no more than six players on either side - 
mimicking the trend in America over the past ten years. Pressure for further consolidation must intensify. 
Perpetual saw funds under management rise 33% to #8bn in the year to September 30, although net new 
business was #300m down on last year, pointing to the underlying competitive pressures facing the industry.

United States firm to take over biggest pension fund manager. 
Mercury Asset Management, the United Kingdom's largest pension fund manager, is to be sold to United States 
investment banking giant Merrill Lynch in an agreed #3.1bn takeover. 
The deal sees one of Britain's largest companies, just outside the FTSE 100, pass into American ownership and 
create the third-largest asset management group in the world in charge of #267bn, leaving Schroders as the last 
big UK independent fund manager. 
Top directors of MAM, including high flier Carol Galley, stand to make millions from the deal selling their shares in 
the group. 
The cash offer values each MAM share at #17, representing a premium of 31.7 per cent against Tuesday's 
closing price. They jumped nearly 380p to #16.75. 
Some will see the move as a vote of confidence in the City as one of the world's top three financial centres - many 
will view with dismay the sight of another winning UK institution passing into foreign hands. 
Merrill Lynch, known on Wall Street as the thundering herd, wants control of pensions and other investments in 
Europe where increasingly people are saving for their retirement as governments withdraw from provision for the 
elderly and retired. 
Backing from Merrill, which has been extremely successful in investment banking in the US, gives MAM the 
strength to develop its brand worldwide, said Colin Morton, a fund manager with BWD Rensburg Unit Trust 
Managers in Leeds. 
"UK institutions are still streets ahead of Europe in pension provision and financial services and their sharedealing 
is more developed than our European neighbours'," he said. "US companies can easily identify with the UK as we 
are similar in many ways. 
"Europe is going to be a huge financial market in the next 20 to 30 years and this gives Merrill Lynch a foothold." 
Mercury Asset Management will be absorbed into Merrill Lynch's fund management arm to form Merrill Lynch 
Mercury Asset Management, though MAM will retain its name in the UK. 
The companies have been in intense talks during the past month before the MAN board agreed the deal. 
MAM employs 1,300 people and provides services for up to 70 FTSE100s companies and handles #104bn of 
funds, including some of Britain's biggest pension funds. 
Merrill Lynch, which employs 54,200 people worldwide, said there would be no redundancies on either side. The 
move will increase its revenues from overseas. 
MAM vice-chairman Carol Galley, one of the most high-profile and powerful women in the City, will serve with 
deputy chairman Stephen Zimmerman as co-head of the enlarged asset management business and will join 
Merrill Lynch's executive management committee. 
And MAM chairman Hugh Stevenson will serve as non-executive chairman of the new asset management group 
to oversee its integration before retiring.

Page 12 of 63 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The trio stand to collect at least #10m each cashing in shares and options while staff and directors will collect 
#135m. 
Merrill Lynch chairman David Komansky said: "For Merrill Lynch, Mercury is an ideal strategic fit and the 
acquisition represents a quantum leap towards our goal of becoming a global leader in the asset management 
business, one of the most attractive segments of the financial services industry." 
The two companies said MAM's clients would benefit from the UK group's stronger global position and its access 
to the resources of its new US partner. 
Mr Stevenson said: "The announcement of this agreement marks a great step forward for both firms. It creates an 
investment management business with a breadth and depth of resource and expertise which it would have taken 
many years for either to have achieved alone." 
MAM became an independent company two years ago after merchant bank SG Warburg, which set up the 
business in 1987, sold its controlling stake. 
Merrill already owns London broking house Smith New Court. 
The Americans and Germans have proved some of the biggest predators in the City of London. 
Well known names to change hands are Morgan Grenfell, bought in 1989 by Deutsche Bank and more recently 
SG Warburg taken over by Swiss Bank Corp to become SBC Warburg, and Kleinwort Benson which fell to 
Dresdner Bank. Jupiter Asset Management lost its independence to Germany's Commerzbank. 
Perhaps the best-known acquisition was when the Dutch group ING snapped up Barings for #1 after the Nick 
Leeson scandal.

THE marriage between Merrill Lynch and Mercury Asset Management was a deal waiting to happen. The US 
giant has aggressive global expansion plans and the UK's second biggest fund manager knew that such a deal 
would put its plans for future growth on the fast track. 
For MAM the deal marks the end of a ten-year period of rapid growth as an independent. Its share price has 
grown 30 times from its flotation in 1987 at the offer price of #17. During the same period the compound annual 
earnings growth rate has been about 20 per cent. Now the group operates in 19 countries and employs about 
1,300 people. Before the deal was announced MAM was capitalised at around #2.4 billion with over #100 billion 
of funds under management. 
However in recent months MAM had experienced tougher times, warning in May that it did not believe it could 
sustain recent growth rates. In August it reorganised its largest UK pooled equity fund after its poor performance. 
The following month the group lost its place in the FTSE 100. 
MAM has played an aggressive and some would say interfering role in corporate life. Its stakes in companies in 
bid situations has proved to be pivotal to the outcome, as in the case of the Granada/Forte and Granada/LWT 
bids. 
Merrill is in a different league altogether and dwarfs MAM in size. Known as "the thundering herd" on Wall Street, 
Merrill Lynch operates in 45 countries, employs about 54,200 people and is capitalised at around $22 billion (#13 
billion). The group has $272 billion funds under management. 
David Komansky, Merrill's larger-than-life boss, has been frank about the group's global ambitions in many 
areas of the business. Two mega-deals this year in US financial services between Dean Witter Discover/Morgan 
Stanley and Traveler's Group/Salomons will have turned up the heat on moves to consolidate. 
Mr Komansky has been with Merrill for 30 years and is not a man to shrink from a challenge. The son of a postal 
worker, brought up in the Bronx and 6ft 4in tall, he is regarded as a corporate heavyweight. In a recent prophetic 
interview he said: "We'd like to build our asset management, have more distribution, and continue to bulk up in 
Asia. We will snap up premier players when they come along, but the opportunities are rare."

MARTIN FLANAGAN City Editor 
MERRILL Lynch, one of America's biggest investment banks, yesterday swooped with a recommended #3.1 
billion takeover bid for Britain's second largest fund manager, Mercury Asset Management. 
The move, ensuring multi-million pound windfalls for key MAM directors such as Carol Galley, dubbed the "ice 
maiden" by the popular press, came as a bombshell yesterday with no prior speculation MAM was considering 
relinquishing independence. 
It was also seen as the latest domino to fall to foreign ownership in the City of London financial services industry. 
Two years ago Merrill, whose nickname is "the thundering herd", snapped up broker Smith New Court for over 
#500 million. At the same time SG Warburg, MAM's then-parent company, was bought by Swiss Bank 
Corporation for #860 million, with the fund management arm being excluded from the deal. 
In the same year British broker Kleinwort was taken over by Germany's Dresdner Bank for #1 billion, and ING of 
Holland rescued Barings for a nominal sum. Only last week BZW confirmed it was selling a large slice of its 
broking and corporate advisory business to Credit Suisse First Boston. 
Herb Allison, the president and chief operating officer of Merrill Lynch, said yesterday the tie-up would create the 
third biggest asset management company in the world with combined funds under management of $450 billion 
(#266 billion). The leader is the US funds giant, Fidelity, followed by AXA Group of France. 
David Komansky, the chairman and chief executive officer of Merrill, said the purchase was "a quantum leap 
towards our goal of becoming a global leader in the asset management business, one of the most attractive 
segments of the financial services industry". 
He said MAM would be the London-based cornerstone of its new global fund management business, to be called 
Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management (MLM). 
Hugh Stevenson, the chairman of MAM, who is staying on for one year to oversee the integration of the groups, 
said a key gain for the British group was that it would give it access to Merrill's financial firepower. There would be 
no redundancies, he added. The difference in scale of the two groups is shown by their latest annual pre-tax 
profits: $300 million in the case of MAM, compared with $3 billion at Merrill. Two senior MAM executives, Stephen 
Zimmerman and Carol Galley, currently deputy chairman and vice-chairman respectively, will head up MLM. 
Merrill is offering #17 in cash for each MAM share, a gain of nearly 32 per cent on the stock market losing price 
on Tuesday night, and over 25 times Mercury's unaudited earnings of 66.8p for the year to end-September. It 
values MAM at 3 per cent of its #104 billion funds under management and is thought by many banking analysts to 
be a full price. 
MAM directors have pledged their holding in the company, amounting to about 1 per cent, in support of the bid, 
meaning they stand to make about #32 million. The biggest winners will be Mr Zimmerman and Andrew Dalton, 
getting over #7 million each. Mr Stevenson is set for #2.9 million and Ms Galley #2.5 million.

The revolution in global financial markets took an unexpected step yesterday as Merrill Lynch agreed a #3.1bn 
takeover of Britain's biggest fund manager, Mercury Asset Management. 
Tom Stevenson, financial editor, watched another British institution fall into foreign ownership. 
Merrill Lynch snapped up Mercury Asset Management yesterday with a #17 a share recommended offer. The 
surprise deal will create the world's third largest fund manager, catapulting MAM's senior fund managers, Carol 
Galley and Stephen Zimmerman, to the head of a global investment powerhouse. 
MAM, which saw its funds under management recently pass the #100bn mark for the first time, will continue 
trading under its current name in the UK. Worldwide, Merrill Lynch Mercury will control $450bn (#266bn) of 
funds, putting it behind only Fidelity and Axa. 
The deal is a further blow to British ownership of the world's leading financial organisations. The takeover follows 
the acquisition by foreign buyers of Morgan Grenfell, SG Warburg, Kleinwort Benson and Barings. Barclays has 
just agreed to sell its investment banking arm, BZW, to Credit Suisse First Boston and NatWest is rumoured to be 
considering a sale of its Markets arm to an overseas bank. 
The terms of the deal, which valued MAM at 3 per cent of its funds under management, took the City by surprise 
and sent shares in other fund managers soaring yesterday. When NatWest bought Gartmore recently it paid 
under 2 per cent of assets under management and yesterday analysts were reassessing the possible value of 
similar businesses. 
M&G, a fund manager with a big retail franchise, saw its shares rise 160p to 1335p, Perpetual jumped 240p to 
2475p and Schroders, an investment bank with a big fund management operation, rose 140p to 1815p. MAM's 
shares closed 380p higher at 1675p. 
The #17 a share being paid by Merrill Lynch in cash represents a 31 per cent premium to MAM's share price 
before the deal was announced. Reflecting an uncharacteristically poor investment performance recently, MAM's 
shares have underperformed the market this year after outperforming strongly in the 10 years since it was floated 
off from its parent SG Warburg in 1987. 
David Komansky, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch, denied yesterday that the takeover, worth 25 
times MAM's earnings last year, represented a classic top-of-bull-market deal. He said MAM was an ideal 
strategic fit for Merrill, adding that the price reflected the great potential of the combined group. 
Fund management is being seen as one of the greatest areas of growth in the financial services. Around the 
world, deregulation, demographic trends and the withdrawal of governments from welfare provision are creating 
opportunities that only large fund managers will be able to fully exploit. 
The deal will give Merrill a leading position in UK fund management and access to European and Asian markets. 
For Mercury, the takeover opens up the vast US market where it has so far had almost no presence. 
Hugh Stevenson, chairman of MAM, will remain with Merrill Lynch for a year to oversee the integration and is 
then expected to bow out. His deputy chairman, Mr Zimmerman, and vice chair Ms Galley become joint heads of 
the combined operation, which will be based in London.

The operations of Merrill and MAM are almost completely complementary and Mr Stevenson promised their 
would be no redundancies as a result of the takeover. MAM employs 1,300 staff in 19 countries, almost 
insignificant compared to Merrill's 54,200 employees in 45 countries. 
The only question mark over the deal was the likely reaction of MAM's institutional clients to its change of 
ownership. Nigel Taylor, a pensions consultant, who advises several Mercury clients, said: "MAM have been 
going through a difficult period, performance-wise on their pension fund assets. This on top is going to unnerve 
people."

Merrill grabs jewel in crown.

THE concentration of power in the global financial services market accelerated yesterday when the huge 
American investment bank, Merrill Lynch, slapped #3.1bn on the table to mop up Mercury Asset Management. 
The deal - which will shower hundreds of millions of pounds on the top executives of MAM - creates a company 
with more than $450bn (#265bn) worth of funds under management. It will rank third in the world after Fidelity of 
the US and France's Axa. 
David Komansky, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch, said Mercury was the "jewel in the crown" of 
asset management. 
He said the acquisition for #17 a share was a "unique opportunity." 
Merrill is understood to have scoured all the major fund management groups in the world in an effort to bolster 
this side of its business, which it reckons is the fastest-growing segment of financial services. 
Hugh Stevenson, chairman of MAM - which already has some #105bn worth of funds under management, said 
his company had been offered "hundreds of merger possibilities" in the US, none of which had met the group's 
criteria until Merrill Lynch came along. 
Both companies argued that the acquisition - which has been under negotiation for several months - underlined 
London's claims to be the fund management centre of the world. 
Although one of MAM's high profile funds has suffered poor performance and Mr Stevenson warned recently that 
the historic 20%-a-year rate of return would not necessarily last forever, Merrill's Mr Komansky denied his 
company was paying over the odds for a top-of-the-market deal. 
The American group was, he stressed, thinking of longer term performance and it was convinced that better 
business growth rates - probably in the high teens - could be achieved by joining together rather than operating 
separately. 
The business of both companies looks to be complementary and no redundancies are forecast in London. 
Indeed, Merrill Lynch is currently working on a new long-term incentive plan for MAM's entire 1,300 employees. 
Merrill Lynch promised that the investment management business - which is expected to expand into new 
products - will remain independent and Carol Galley and Stephen Zimmerman, vice-chairman and deputy 
chairman of MAM will become co-heads of the new-style Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management. 
Mr Stevenson, the 54-year-old executive who has been chairman of MAM since 1992 and a director since 1986, 
will become non-executive chairman for a year to oversee the merger. 
He declined to comment on his future after that. 
The acquisition, which follows the purchase by Merrill Lynch of a smaller asset management business earlier 
this year and the takeover three years ago of the big London stockbroker, Smith New Court, will renew 
speculation about the independent future of other fund management groups in the City. 
Merrill said that the deal would substantially increase its fee-based revenue and would help build non-US income.

It has been a year of rapid change for US financial institutions. Merrill Lynch, which started the year as an 
investment banking giant, was overtaken by the merger of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter, and Travelers Smith 
Barney's takeover of Salomon Brothers. 
But the empire is fighting back. Yesterday's acquisition of Mercury Asset Management puts the Thundering Herd 
back in the game. "It's a good fit for Merrill," said Mr Michael Flanagan of Financial Service Analytics. 
The deal "furthers their strategic objective of being a truly global integrated full-service financial firm and will 
accelerate integration" within the financial services industry. 
It was also a tremendous coup because it came out of the blue. Although MAM had been a potential takeover 
target since SG Warburg's 75% stake was placed two-and-a-half years ago, no one got a anticipatory sniff of 
Merrill's secret "Project Messenger", with its allusions to the Roman messenger of the gods. 
Analysts said MAM's strong institutional presence in Europe fitted well with Merrill's business, which includes a 
huge retail brokerage network with $1,000bn of assets under control. 
"I think it's a bold move but I think it's the right move," said Mr Paul Scura, head of investment banking at 
Prudential Securities. "It gives them a level of institutional credibility far beyond what they had in the past." 
Despite its acquisition of Hotchkis and Wiley a year ago, Merrill has not been a large or notable force in US 
institutional asset management. Led by the MAM management team, it plans to change that. 
MAM's command of international financial markets "gives them a plus," says Mr Michael Lipper, president of 
Lipper Analytical Services who notes wryly that "for some groups a British accent is worth 10 basis points". 
However, while MAM has a strong UK business, it has yet to establish a real foothold in the emerging market for 
pension funds and mutual funds in Europe. "I don't think Mercury has established much in continental Europe. But 
many of the trends - the personalisation of retirement pensions in the UK - will translate into the continent." 
Hugh Stevenson, MAM's chairman, said the takeover would give his company "extraordinary access to the US 
and other markets. It gives us access to Merrill Lynch's capital and information technology". 
The combined firm will have "a product line to compete with anybody" said David Komansky, Merrill's chairman 
and chief executive officer. He said Merrill would expand its existing private client business and distribution 
network in Europe. 
The MAM deal, however, will also provide a fillip to Merrill in its home market. Merrill Lynch-branded products 
are sold only through its own retail network, an exclusivity jealously guarded by an army of sales people. 
Merrill plans to use Mercury as an alternative brand in the US, to be sold through competing networks. This will 
require the creation from scratch of a wholesale distribution operation. 
At about 3% of assets under management, Merrill is paying a full price for Mercury, according to analysts, who 
note that it is at the high end of recent deals. "When Merrill makes an acquisition, it buys choice properties at full 
prices," observed Sallie Krawcheck, securities industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.

Page 20 of 63 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
She noted that its record of integrating acquisitions such as Smith New Court in the UK and FG, the Spanish 
broker, has been strong so far, but "they've done so in a bull market". 
Merrill conceded it was paying a "very full price" for a stand-alone asset management group, but argued that the 
combined group would grow faster together than either could separately. Mr Komansky said: "I'm very hopeful 
that this is not a top of the market transaction". 
In Europe, Merrill has only recently begun to shed its image of an American abroad. It is now the leading equities 
dealer in the UK and in Spain and has a growing presence in markets as Italy. Yet it lacks dedicated "country 
funds" to sell through its nascent retail networks. 
Merrill's competitors, such as Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs, will now be eyeing comparable 
opportunities more keenly than ever. But, noted Mr Lipper, "the issue has never been buyers, it's been sellers. 
Will something that wasn't for sale yesterday become for sale today beause of the fear of what the Merrill 
acquisition means and/or because people are drooling at the price?" The answer, he suspects, is that it could, but 
there "aren't that many great names" available. 
For Merrill, the question is what next. Mr Komansky believes this is the beginning, not the end, of a five-year 
period of rapid consolidation in the financial services industry, Merrill has said that it will have to target growth 
outside the US, given its existing capacity in the mature domestic market. 
Merrill said it envisaged making no other fund management acquisitions of this size, although niche deals in 
specific sectors and countries were possible. 
There are a number of obvious holes to fill, for example in Asia, where asset prices have fallen considerably. Mr 
Komansky said that he would not be interested in buying Yamaichi Securities, the troubled Japanese brokerage, 
but that the firm was looking at other methods of distribution in Japan. 
Merrill executives in London indicated Japan would be a priority for growth as deregulation began. 
Mr Komansky said that the firm was interested in acquisitions in Asia outside Japan, but noted that there were 
few truly pan-Asian businesses. "There couldn't be more than three or four organisations that might be attractive 
and we've looked at all of them. It's more likely that if the opportunity arose we'd do what we did in Australia or 
Spain" where Merrill has bought local brokerage businesses. 
Merrill also has gaps which need to be filled in Europe, notably in France and Germany where it has yet to 
establish strong retail networks. 
Meanwhile, the worldwide pace of consolidation throughout the industry is likely to remain hot. "This will step up 
the desire to compete on the part of both domestic and international firms," said Mr Flanagan.

Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, announced a #3.1bn ($5.2bn) agreed cash offer for Mercury Asset 
Management yesterday in a move which could create one of the largest fund management groups in the world. 
The offer, which puts another nail in the coffin of independent financial services groups in the UK, is also set to 
make the three top directors of MAM, the UK's leading fund management company, almost #50m richer. 
Hugh Stevenson, MAM's chairman, will receive almost #24m from long-term incentive schemes and shares, some 
of which are held in a charitable trust. Mr Stevenson will become non-executive chairman of the combined group 
for a year if the deal is agreed by shareholders. 
Carol Galley, MAM's vice-chairman, and Stephen Zimmerman, deputy chairman, are set to receive about #10m 
and #14m respectively. 
Both are to join Merrill's executive management committee, making Ms Galley the first woman to do so - and the 
most senior female at Merrill. The two, who were paid a total of #10.77m last year, will serve as co-heads of the 
new business, to be known as Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management and based in London. Mr Stevenson 
said the "continuity of management" should help the group retain its independent approach. 
Merrill is also to offer "attractive incentive plans" to guarantee staff retention. The directors on MAM's board, who 
together own about 1% of the group, have given undertakings to accept the bid - worth #17 a share. The group's 
employees own about 3%. 
MAM's shareholders, which include Prudential and Flemings, will also receive the interim dividend of 12.5p 
declared earlier this month. 
The surprise offer, at 3% of MAM's #104.4bn in funds under management, is at the top end of deals in the sector 
over the past few years. 
The price, at 32% above MAM's closing share price on Tuesday, represents a multiple of 25 times earnings for 
the year to September 30. Both sides said the price was a full one. 
Analysts said yesterday a further bid was unlikely. However, MAM directors emphasised their commitment to the 
Merrill deal. 
The acquisition takes the total assets managed by Merrill from $272bn to $449bn and is a further indication of the 
process of rapid consolidation in the global fund management industry. 
Merrill said the combined group would be the third-largest dedicated fund manager in the world. "This acquisition 
represents a quantum leap toward our goal of becoming a global leader in the asset management business, one 
of the most attractive segments of the financial services industry," said David Komansky, chairman and chief 
executive of Merrill. This view was endorsed by Herb Allison, president and chief operating officer. 
MAM is dominant in the UK institutional market but has struggled to make headway in the US. In contrast, 
Merrill's fund management strength lies in the US retail market. 
Merrill plans to use MAM's institutional strength to expand into Europe and Asia and there are also plans for 
MAM's retail products to be sold by Merrill's 13,000 US financial sales staff.

Some $249bn will be managed in London by the new group with the remaining $200bn in US mutual funds 
managed in the US. Both sides said there would be no job losses in a combined workforce of about 55,500. 
Lazard Brothers, the UK investment bank, advised MAM on the deal.

Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, announced a #3.1bn ($5.2bn) agreed cash offer for Mercury Asset 
Management yesterday in a move which could create one of the largest fund management groups in the world. 
The offer, which puts another nail in the coffin of independent financial services groups in the UK, is also set to 
make the three top directors of MAM, the UK's leading fund management company, almost #50m richer. 
Hugh Stevenson, MAM's chairman, will receive almost #24m from long-term incentive schemes and shares, some 
of which are held in a charitable trust. Mr Stevenson will become non-executive chairman of the combined group 
for a year if the deal is agreed by shareholders. 
Carol Galley, MAM's vice-chairman, and Stephen Zimmerman, deputy chairman, are set to receive about #10m 
and #14m respectively. 
Both are to join Merrill's executive management committee, making Ms Galley the first woman to do so - and the 
most senior female at Merrill. The two, who were paid a total of #10.77m last year, will serve as co-heads of the 
new business, to be known as Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management and based in London. Mr Stevenson 
said the "continuity of management" should help the group retain its independent approach. 
Merrill is also to offer "attractive incentive plans" to guarantee staff retention. The directors on MAM's board, who 
together own about 1% of the group, have given undertakings to accept the bid - worth #17 a share. The group's 
employees own about 3%. 
MAM's shareholders, which include Prudential and Flemings, will also receive the interim dividend of 12.5p 
declared earlier this month. 
The surprise offer, at 3% of MAM's #104.4bn in funds under management, is at the top end of deals in the sector 
over the past few years. 
The price, at 32% above MAM's closing share price on Tuesday, represents a multiple of 25 times earnings for 
the year to September 30. Both sides said the price was a full one. 
Analysts said yesterday a further bid was unlikely. However, MAM directors emphasised their commitment to the 
Merrill deal. 
The acquisition takes the total assets managed by Merrill from $272bn to $449bn and is a further indication of the 
process of rapid consolidation in the global fund management industry. 
Merrill said the combined group would be the third-largest dedicated fund manager in the world. "This acquisition 
represents a quantum leap toward our goal of becoming a global leader in the asset management business, one 
of the most attractive segments of the financial services industry," said David Komansky, chairman and chief 
executive of Merrill. This view was endorsed by Herb Allison, president and chief operating officer. 
MAM is dominant in the UK institutional market but has struggled to make headway in the US. In contrast, 
Merrill's fund management strength lies in the US retail market. 
Merrill plans to use MAM's institutional strength to expand into Europe and Asia and there are also plans for 
MAM's retail products to be sold by Merrill's 13,000 US financial sales staff.

Some $249bn will be managed in London by the new group with the remaining $200bn in US mutual funds 
managed in the US. Both sides said there would be no job losses in a combined workforce of about 55,500. 
Lazard Brothers, the UK investment bank, advised MAM on the deal.

Merrill Lynch, one of the world's largest investment banks, is to pay US$3.1 billion for Mercury Asset 
Management (MAM), one of Britain's biggest fund managers, in a deal set to create the world's third-largest 
investment management house. 
The deal, which has been recommended by MAM's management to its shareholders, would form a combined 
group with about $450 billion in funds under management and is expected to make it the world's most profitable 
fund manager. 
Under the terms of the offer, which was priced at a staggering 31.7 per cent premium to MAM's closing share 
price on Tuesday, gross income to shareholders would jump 97.3 per cent as a result of the deal. 
The merged group will rank third behind United States-based Fidelity Investors and giant French insurance group 
AXA-UAP among the world's biggest fund managers. 
The deal is aimed at bringing together Merrill's strong US retail investor base with MAM's dominant position in the 
international institutional market. 
Merrill, which to the end of September had GBP161 billion (about HK$2.11 trillion) under management, relies on 
US-based and sector funds. 
MAM has about GBP104.4 billion under management, of which 67 per cent comes from British institutional 
investors, with the remainder among international institutions and private investors. It has a small presence in the 
US. 
MAM manages funds for more than half of Britain's top-100 listed companies and more than half of the 50 largest 
Japanese corporate pension funds. It has 900 British pension fund clients, including five of the world's 10 largest 
pension funds. 
According to the terms of the merger, MAM would retain its original name in Britain, but elsewhere the combined 
group would be known as Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management, and will be based in London. 
"We believe that the acquisition of Mercury will leave us uniquely positioned to capitalise on the substantial 
worldwide growth opportunities that we see ahead in the asset management business," Merrill Lynch chairman 
and chief executive officer David Komansky said. 
Merrill is particularly eager to build its presence in Asia as governments in the region begin establishing 
state-organised pension funds, such as Hong Kong's Mandatory Provident Fund, which is to be farmed out to 
investment managers. 
Within the region, MAM's headquarters are in Singapore, where the group is regarded as having a strong 
position, as well as in Japan and Australia. 
Merrill has a much larger presence in Hong Kong, but it also has a strong distribution network and large sales 
force in the region, which MAM would be able to utilise. 
"In Hong Kong, we will be able to take Mercury's fund family through our sales force," Merrill executive 
vice-president Jerry Kenny said.

Officials from both Merrill and MAM also said the deal provided for almost no overlap, particulary in Asia, where 
both companies were strong in locations where the other had very little, or even no presence. 
The deal would allow Merrill to boost its non-US earnings and stabilise its revenue flows, as well as expand its 
ability to offer more defined contribution and discretionary management products. 
Mercury would significantly expand its ability to distribute a range of investment products on a global scale, and 
gain access to the financial and technological resources of one of the world's largest financial groups. 
MAM chairman Hugh Stevenson said: "Our objective remains to be one of the most successful international 
investment management groups."

(c) 1997 Reuters Limited 
NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. Wednesday agreed to buy Britain's largest fund 
manager, Mercury Asset Management, for $5.3 billion in a bid to expand in the fast-growing business of 
managing people's money. 
The offer, which got the unanimous backing of Mercury's board, will create the world's third largest fund manager 
and secure Merrill's future as a giant in the global securities industry, officials and analysts said. 
Merrill and other firms have been forced to find partners to better woo customers and build up their capital in 
order to compete in the rapidly consolidating industry. 
"We believe that in the very near future our industry will be dominated by a handful of firms," Merrill Chairman 
David Komansky said at a New York news conference. "This acquisition will help ensure our place as a global 
leader." 
The combined company, with $450 billion in assets under management, will give Merrill a firmer toehold in 
Europe and Asia. Mercury's clients include five of the world's biggest pension funds and 25 major corporate 
pension funds in Japan. 
The fund management industry is growing quickly in many countries as regulations are loosened and more 
people invest for retirement, while governments have cut retirement benefits. 
Merrill talked to dozens of firms before securing a deal with Mercury, but its shopping spree proved expensive. 
Komansky said the negotiations were "extemely painful," citing the high price, but added Merrill was "thrilled" 
over the deal. 
Expanding in asset management was Merrill's "single highest priority," one executive said, and Komansky said 
the British fund manager was an ideal fit. 
The asset management business will grow rapidly in Europe, and the deal gives Merrill a "huge head start over 
the competition," industry analyst Raphael Soifer at Brown Brothers Harriman said in a research note. 
"As with Smith New Court, however, Merrill has paid a top price," he added. In 1995, Merrill paid 500 million 
pounds, equivalent to $850 million under today's exchange rates, for the British brokerage. 
The Mercury deal makes Merrill the latest securities house to agree to a multibillion-dollar acquisition. Travelers 
Group Inc. agreed to buy Salomon Inc. for $9 billion in September, and Morgan Stanley Group and Dean Witter, 
Discover & Co. completed their $10.7 billion merger earlier this year. 
Mercury Chairman Hugh Stevenson said the purchase would create an investment management business with 
resources and expertise that would have taken years for either company to achieve on its own. He promised 
there would be no layoffs following the deal. 
The new fund management group, Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management, will be headquartered in London 
and headed by two senior Mercury executives, Carol Galley and Stephen Zimmerman, currently vice chairman 
and deputy chairman of Mercury.

Mercury will continue to operate under its own name in Britain. The firm, which last year made profits of 171 
million pounds ($290 million), employs 1,300 people in 19 offices around the world. 
It is, however, dwarfed by Merrill's 54,200 employees in more than 750 offices in 45 countries. 
Under the deal, Merrill offered $28.81 cash for each Mercury share, a premium of 32 percent above Tuesday's 
closing price. 
At the end of the third quarter, Merrill had $1.02 trillion of assets in client accounts and $304 billion in assets 
under management. 
Mercury stock jumped on the news, rising 386 pence to 16.80 pounds ($27.12), as did shares of other British fund 
managers. 
Merrill rose $1.06 to $67.25 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

(c) 1997 Reuters Limited 
NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc concluded two weeks of "extremely painful" talks with 
Britain's Mercury Asset Management Group Plc with a costly deal to buy Britain's largest fund manager. 
"It was a negotiated transaction, albeit an extemely painful negotiated transaction as evidenced by the price we 
were forced to pay ... . But we think it is a full and fair price ... and are thrilled to be able to do it," Merrill Chairman 
David Komansky said, responding to questions at a New York news conference. 
The proposed $5.3 billion purchase, approved by both companies boards Tuesday, will expand Merrill's global 
girth and reaffirm its standing as a Wall Street's behemoth capable of growing amid a steady consolidation in 
financial services. 
Raphael Soifer, Brown Brothers Harriman analyst, said in a research note, said he expected "the European asset 
management business to grow rapidly in coming years, and this transaction should give Merrill a huge head start 
over the competition." 
"As with Smith New Court, however, Merrill has paid a top price. We like this deal strategically, but wish it had not 
been so expensive," Soifer said. 
In 1995, Merrill paid 500 million pounds sterling, nearly $850 million at current exchange rates, for U.K. brokerage 
Smith New Court. 
"We believe that in the very near future, our industry will be dominated by a handful of firms. This acquisition will 
help ensure our place as a global leader and advance the interest of shareholders and our clients through out the 
world," Komansky said. 
Merrill's chief financial officer, Joseph Willett, said the price, equal to $28.78 per share cash, is 25 times Mercury's 
trailing 12-month earnings and about three percent of assets under manangement. That "is at the high end of the 
range of other transactions that we have seen over the last several years," Willett said. 
The offer represents 32 percent premium above the market price of Mercury shares before the offer was 
announced. 
Merrill said the purchase would raise overseas revenues to about 30 percent of the total from 25 percent, and 
create the world's third-largest fund manager with $450 billion in assets under its wing. 
For the nine months ended Sept. 26, Merrill posted net revenues of $11.8 billion versus $9.73 billion in the 
comparable 1996 period, and earnings of $3.62 per share on a fully diluted basis versus $2.95. 
At the end of the third quarter, Merrill had $1.02 trillion of assets in client accounts and $304 billion in assets 
under management. 
Asset management revenues have grown at double-digit rates in recent over a number of years, Komansky said. 
In view of worldwide demographic trends, the shift to private pension funds and the globalization of financial 
services , "we have no doubt that substantial growth opportunities will continue," he said. 
"This is not the last thing that we'll do, although we certainly don't have anything to announce in the near future," 
he said.

Herbert Allison, Merrill's president and chief operating officer, said the Mercury combination would accelerate the 
company's sharp gains in fee-based revenues, up more than 16 percent per year for the last five years. 
"It advances out long-term strategy of emphasizing stable, fee-based revenues, which help decrease earnings 
volatility across market cycles," Allison said.

US investment bank Merrill Lynch is to create one of the world's top fund management groups through a friendly 
takeover of Mercury Asset Management (MAM) for #3.1bn sterling, which was unveiled yesterday. 
By acquiring MAM, the largest British investment fund management group alongside Schroders, Merrill Lynch 
will increase funds under management by 65% to $450bn (#300bn). This will put it in third place in the global fund 
management industry, behind Fidelity Investments of the United States and Groupe AXA of France. "For Merrill 
Lynch, Mercury is an ideal strategic fit, and the acquisition represents a quantum leap towards our goal of 
becoming a global leader in the asset management business, one of the most attractive segments of the financial 
services industry," said Mr David Komansky, chairman and chief executive officer of Merrill Lynch. 
Merrill Lynch offered #17 in cash per share in MAM. This represented a premium of 31.7% on the MAM share 
price on Tuesday of #12.91.

US bid for Mercury 
AMERICAN stockbroking giant Merrill Lynch dropped its "thundering herd" tag and trotted quietly into the City 
yesterday to deliver a bombshell #3100m bid for Mercury Asset Management. 
The highly-rated fund management group is recommending shareholders accept the #17 cash per share offer, 
which compares with Tuesday's closing share price of #13. 
Mercury is one of the City's largest fund managers, being in charge of #104bn for pension funds and other 
investors. Joining forces with Merrill will create the third-largest fund manager in the world behind Fidelity and 
AXA, with #266bn under management. 
The deal means another major institution passing into foreign ownership, but reinforces the City's role as the 
leading centre for international fund management. 
Mercury will continue to be run by Stephen Zimmerman and Carol Galley, dubbed the "ice maiden" after her cool 
decision to throw her investment funds behind Granada in its battle for Forte. 
Chairman Hugh Stevenson, who will stay for a year to help implement the merger, said existing clients would 
benefit from the company having access to Merrill's capital and tech-nology. Mr Stevenson said they were 
accustomed to being part of a larger group as Mercury had only parted from Warburgs in 1995. 
The three Mercury directors will collect millions from share options following the bid. 
Merrill has been looking to expand its non-US interests and examined a number of fund managers before 
deciding on Mercury. 
Chairman David Komansky explained that the acquisition represented a quantum leap in their goal of becoming 
a global leader in asset management and would greatly increase their range of products and services. 
Individual country funds for Europe are one priority. 
Mr Komansky added that Merrill would be a more balanced company, split half and half retail and institutional 
and half dollar and half non-dollar. The move will also increase the proportion of Merrill's earnings coming from 
stable fee-income. 
The group believes fund management is a long-term growth industry due to demographic trends and the global 
move towards funded pensions. 
Mercury expects to benefit from Merrill's strong capital and technology base and international spread, which will 
give it more distribution channels for its products. In particular, it will provide better access to the US market, 
where it has limited exposure. 
Merrill has ridden the Wall Street bull market with sharply rising profits, which came to #830m last year. It is 
currently capitalised at #13bn. 
The price offered for Mercury was considered generous by analysts considering that earnings could be vulnerable 
to a further downturn in stock markets and that Mercury was essentially a people business.

JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNNfn ANCHOR, STREET SWEEP: Merrill Lynch (URL: http://www.ml.com/) is moving to 
become a dominant player in global asset management. It's buying London's Mercury Asset Management for 
$5.3 billion in cash. The deal creates the third largest mutual fund management group in the world, and is 
evidence of Merrill's strategy to quickly build its 
global platform. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
COMMERICAL NARRATOR: We connect investors to opportunities. 
DEFTERIOS (voice-over): Merrill Lynch has global ambitions. To drive home the point, a transatlantic press 
conference after gobbling up Britain's premier fund manager. 
DAVID KOMANSKY, CHAIRMAN & CEO, MERRILL LYNCH: I think this acquisition, very frankly, from a strategic 
point of view, is probably the neatest, tightest fit that we could possibly have found. 
DEFTERIOS: The chairman and CEO admitted negotiations were painful. At $5.3 billion, Merrill is paying a 
premium. To cushion the cost, it's spreading out payments for the all cash deal over 15 years, saving more than 
$1 billion in taxes. 
Merrill becomes No. 3 in global fund management, behind Fidelity() and France's group, Oxso (ph), which owns 
the Equitable (URL: http://www.equitable.com) in the US. The new group will be London based, with Mercury 
calling the shots. 
STEVE ZIMMERMAN, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN, MERCURY ASSET MANAGEMENT: We have no intention of 
changing what is already a very successful mix, both in our business and the businesses that Merrill own. 
DEFTERIOS: After this move, a third of Merrill's business will be outside the US. In 1995, Merrill bought UK 
brokerage, Smith Newcourt, for $800 million, followed up by deals in Spain, Italy, South Africa, India, Indonesia 
and Australia. Like its predecessor at Merrill, Dan Tully, Komansky has maintained strong earnings, up 22 
percent in the first nine months, while spending heavily. 
MATTHEW CZPLIEWICZ, BROKERAGE ANALYST, SALOMON BROTHERS: Having that global platform with a 
major presence in the US, a major presence in the UK, a large international business, is I think a competitive 
edge in such marketing. 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
DEFTERIOS: And the marketing and buying is likely to continue. Merrill says it will fill strategic gaps (ph) and 
move forward on an as needed basis with other deals. Let's take a look at the stock. It is up, even though it did 
pay a premium here - up 1 1/2 at 67 11/16. Mercury trades in London, but the stock is up better than 50 percent in 
the last year of trading.

and Mercury Asset Management Group plc ("Mercury") announce the terms of a recommended cash offer for 
the issued share capital of Mercury. The Offer will be made by Merrill Lynch International on behalf of ML Invest 
PLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch. 
The Offer: * is #17.00 in cash for each Mercury Share * values the issued share capital of Mercury at 
approximately #3,108 million * allows Mercury Shareholders to retain the interim dividend of 12.5p (net) per 
Mercury Share declared on 6 November 1997 * represents a premium of 31.7 per cent. to the closing middle 
market price of #12.91 per Mercury Share on 18 November 1997 (the day prior to this announcement) * 
represents a multiple of 25.4 times Mercury's unaudited earnings per share of 66.8p for the 12 months ended 30 
September 1997 * values the issued share capital of Mercury at approximately 3.0 per cent. of Mercury's funds 
under management of #104.4 billion as at 30 September 1997 * includes a Loan Note Alternative 
The board of Mercury, which has been so advised by Lazard Brothers, considers the terms of the Offer to be fair 
and reasonable and unanimously recommends Mercury Shareholders to accept the Offer. The directors of 
Mercury have irrevocably undertaken to accept the Offer in respect of their beneficial holdings, amounting to 
1,907,564 Mercury Shares and representing approximately 1.0 per cent. of the issued share capital of Mercury. 
The acquisition of Mercury by Merrill Lynch creates one of the largest asset management groups in the world. It 
will strengthen significantly Merrill Lynch's ability to provide fund management services to its institutional and 
retail clients on a global basis. Mercury will give Merrill Lynch a leading position in the UK fund management 
market and will broaden its overall range of non-US products and services, increasing its institutional capability 
and also enhancing its growth prospects in the important European and Asian markets. The combination of 
Mercury and Merrill Lynch significantly advances both organisations' strategic objective of becoming the premier 
global provider of asset management services. 
For Merrill Lynch, the acquisition is consistent with its strategic goals of: 
* achieving a higher proportion of stable fee-based revenues, thereby delivering added value for Merrill Lynch 
shareholders * expanding funds under management - which will increase by nearly 65 per cent. to approximately 
$450 billion (#266 billion) * further increasing the proportion of Merrill Lynch's revenues coming from outside the 
US.

As a result, Mercury's clients will benefit from:. * continuity in terms of both senior management and the 
independence of the investment process that have formed the foundation for Mercury's business success * an 
acceleration of Mercury's key corporate objective to create a world-leading specialist fund management business 
headquartered in London and strong both in the UK and the US * a step change in Mercury's ability to distribute 
its range of investment products on a global scale * access to the financial and technological resources of one of 
the world's leading financial services groups * a common culture of client service which has driven the success of 
both firms. 
Commenting on the announcement, David Komansky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Merrill Lynch, 
said: 
"The combination of Merrill Lynch and Mercury will create one of the largest asset management companies in 
the world. For Merrill Lynch, Mercury is an ideal strategic fit and the acquisition represents a quantum leap 
towards our goal of becoming a global leader in the asset management business, one of the most attractive 
segments of the financial services industry. It also dramatically expands the range of products and services we 
are able to offer our clients around the world. 
"With combined assets under management of $450 billion, we will have a leading position in asset management 
in the UK and the US and a strong platform for future growth in every region in the world. We believe that the 
acquisition of Mercury will leave us uniquely positioned to capitalise on the substantial worldwide growth 
opportunities that we see ahead in the asset management business." 
Hugh Stevenson, Chairman of Mercury, said: 
"Over the past ten years, Mercury has established a reputation for consistency, performance and professionalism. 
We have measured our success by our ability to deliver increasing levels of service to our clients, rising returns to 
our shareholders and outstanding career opportunities to our employees. 
"Since Mercury was listed as a public company ten years ago, one of the board's primary objectives has been to 
deliver value to shareholders. Since 1987, Mercury has an exceptional record of providing shareholder value and, 
at the Offer price, the total return to Mercury's shareholders has exceeded their investment by over 30 times. This 
Offer provides an excellent price for shareholders, fully reflecting the underlying value of Mercury; it recognises 
the quality of Mercury's business and its commitment to delivering shareholder value. 
"The announcement of this agreement marks a great step forward for both firms. It creates an investment 
management business with a breadth and depth of resource and expertise which it would have taken many years 
for either to have achieved alone. Investment management as an activity will continue to be independent. Our 
objective remains to be one of the most successful international investment management groups."

Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. 
through its wholly-owned subsidiary 
ML Invest PLC 
Recommended Cash Offer 
for 
Mercury Asset Management Group plc 
1. Introduction 
The boards of directors of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("Merrill Lynch") and Mercury Asset Management Group 
plc ("Mercury") announce that they have reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer to be 
made by Merrill Lynch International on behalf of ML Invest PLC to acquire the whole of the issued share capital 
of Mercury. 
The Offer is #17.00 in cash for each Mercury Share, valuing the issued share capital of Mercury at approximately 
#3,108 million. Assuming the exercise of all outstanding options, the Offer values Mercury at approximately 
#3,211 million. Mercury Shareholders will be entitled to retain the interim dividend of 12.5p (net) per Mercury 
Share declared on 6 November 1997. 
The board of Mercury, which has been so advised by Lazard Brothers, considers the terms of the Offer to be fair 
and reasonable and unanimously recommends all Mercury Shareholders to accept the Offer. In providing advice 
to the board of Mercury, Lazard Brothers has taken into account the commercial assessments of the directors of 
Mercury. 
The directors of Mercury have irrevocably undertaken to accept the Offer in respect of their beneficial holdings, 
amounting to 1,907,564 Mercury Shares and representing approximately 1.0 per cent. of Mercury's issued 
ordinary share capital. 
Merrill Lynch International is broker to the Offer. 
2. The Offer 
The Offer, which will be subject to the conditions and further terms set out in Appendix I and in the formal offer 
document, will be made on the 
following basis: 
for each Mercury Share #17.00 in cash. Acceptance of the Offer will not prevent 
Mercury Shareholders from receiving and retaining the interim dividend of 12.5p 
(net) per Mercury Share declared on 6 November 1997 in respect of the six months 
ended 30 September 1997. The interim dividend is payable on 7 January 1998 to 
Mercury Shareholders on the register on 5 December 1997.

Page 44 of 63 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The Offer values the entire issued share capital of Mercury at approximately #3,108 million and represents a 
premium of 31.7 per cent. over the closing middle market price of #12.91 per Mercury Share on 18 November 
1997, the day prior to this announcement. 
The Offer value of #17.00 per Mercury Share represents a multiple of 25.4 times Mercury's unaudited earnings 
per share of 66.8p for the 12 months ended 30 September 1997 and values the issued share capital of Mercury at 
approximately 3.0 per cent. of Mercury's total funds under management of #104.4 billion as at 30 September 
1997. 
Further details of the financial effects of acceptance of the Offer are set out in Appendix II. 
3. Loan Note Alternative As an alternative to all or part of the cash consideration available under the Offer, 
accepting Mercury Shareholders other than certain overseas shareholders will be entitled to elect to receive Loan 
Notes to 
be issued by ML Invest PLC on the following basis: 
For each #1 of cash #1 nominal of Loan 
otherwise available Notes 
under the Offer 
The Loan Notes will be issued, credited as fully paid, in amounts and 
integral multiples of #1 nominal value. 
The payment of principal and interest in respect of the Loan Notes will be guaranteed by Merrill Lynch. The Loan 
Notes will bear interest (from the date of issue to the relevant holder of Loan Notes) payable every 3 months in 
arrears at the rate of the 3 month London Inter-Bank Offer Rate as determined on the first business day of each 
interest period less 0.5 per cent. per annum. Interest will be payable (less any tax required by law to be deducted 
therefrom) in arrears on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December in each year. The first payment will 
be made on 31 March 1998 in respect of the period from and including the date of issue of the Loan Notes. 
Holders of the Loan Notes will have the right to redeem them for cash at par on 31 March 1999 or on any 
subsequent interest payment dates. Unless previously redeemed or repurchased, the Loan Notes will be repaid at 
par on 31 March 2003. ML Invest PLC does not intend to seek a listing for the Loan Notes on any stock 
exchange. 
No Loan Notes will be issued unless valid elections for the Loan Note Alternative will result in the issue of at least 
#2 million in nominal value of Loan Notes, or such smaller amount as ML Invest PLC may decide. If the Loan 
Notes are not issued in these circumstances, Mercury Shareholders who elect for the Loan Note Alternative will 
instead receive cash in accordance with the terms of the Offer. 
The Loan Note Alternative is conditional upon the Offer becoming or being declared unconditional in all respects. 
Further details of the Loan Notes will be set out in the formal offer document. 4. Background to and Reasons for 
the Offer Both Mercury and Merrill Lynch see considerable growth opportunities in the fund management 
business, as changes take place globally in the pattern of savings and investment flows due to the deregulation of 
financial markets, demographic trends, shifting employment expectations and reductions in state welfare 
provision. In many countries, the global fund management industry is currently experiencing rapid growth as a 
result of these favourable trends. To take advantage of these opportunities, both Mercury and Merrill Lynch have 
been seeking to expand their asset management businesses outside their domestic markets. Merrill Lynch has 
developed a strategy of building strong, locally-managed businesses in key markets which can access the global 
resources and capabilities of the Merrill Lynch Group, while Mercury has been expanding its operations in 
continental Europe, Asia and Japan. 
The combination of Mercury and Merrill Lynch creates one of the world's largest asset management groups, with 
approximately $450 billion (#266 billion) of funds under management, and will provide a strong platform for future 
growth. Mercury will be able to accelerate its ambition of becoming one of the leading global asset management 
companies, with powerful new US and global distribution channels for both its individual and institutional asset 
management products. Merrill Lynch has long sought to expand its asset management business outside the US. 
The acquisition of Mercury significantly enhances the scale of Merrill Lynch's fund management business, gives 
Merrill Lynch a leading position in the key UK market and broadens its overall range of non-US products and 
services. Furthermore, Mercury will contribute to the growth of all four of Merrill Lynch's core businesses - Asset 
Management, US Private Client, International Private Client, and the Corporate and Institutional Client Group.

Page 45 of 63 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Following the acquisition, the existing business of Mercury will be combined with the worldwide institutional 
business of Merrill Lynch Asset Management to form Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management. Merrill Lynch 
Mercury Asset Management will be headquartered in London and, within the UK, Mercury's business will 
continue to be conducted under its existing name. 
The pooling of Merrill Lynch's and Mercury's complementary fund management skills and expertise into one 
integrated group leaves the combined operation well-positioned to: 
* offer a broad and attractive range of international and institutional funds to the global investment community * 
benefit from the trend by US investors, both retail and institutional, towards increasing their exposure to 
international markets * address the rapidly-growing demand for investment management services in the 
European market, particularly in defined 
contribution pension products.

On 9 October 1997, Merrill Lynch announced that the total value of its private client assets and assets under

7. Management and employees 
The activities of Mercury are highly complementary to the investment management activities of Merrill Lynch, in 
particular the institutional 
business of its subsidiary Merrill Lynch Asset Management. The 
contribution of Mercury to Merrill Lynch and the importance of maintaining continuity for Mercury clients will be 
reflected in the appointment of Mercury's management to senior positions within the enlarged investment 
management operations of Merrill Lynch. 
Hugh Stevenson will be the non-executive Chairman of Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management and will 
remain in this position for the year following the acquisition in order to oversee the integration of the two 
businesses. Carol Galley and Stephen Zimmerman will serve as co-heads of Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset 
Management and will join the Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. Executive Management Committee. Merrill Lynch has 
given assurances to the directors of Mercury that the rights of all Mercury employees, including their pension 
rights, will be fully safeguarded. There will be no redundancies arising from the proposed combination. Merrill 
Lynch attaches great importance to the key employees of Mercury continuing to have performance-related 
incentives. Existing remuneration arrangements have been reviewed by Merrill Lynch and Mercury and, 
following the acquisition, it is Merrill Lynch's intention to put in place employee incentive plans to ensure that the 
combined business maintains a successful team for its future growth and development. It is intended that the 
plans will be in accordance with industry practice. 
8. Mercury Share Option Schemes The Offer will extend to any Mercury Shares unconditionally allotted or issued 
prior to the date on which the Offer closes (or such earlier date as ML Invest PLC may, subject to the Code, 
determine) as a result of the exercise of options granted under the Mercury Share Option Schemes. To the extent 
that such options are not exercised and in the event that the Offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all 
respects, appropriate proposals will be put to holders of options under the Mercury Share 
Option Schemes.

thereto, including the right to all dividends and other distributions (if any) declared, made or paid hereafter save

(c) 1997 Reuters Limited 
NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc's proposed $5.3 billion acquisition of Mercury Asset 
Management Group Plc will dilute Merrill's earnings in the first year after the deal closes, Merrill Chief Financial 
Officer Joe Willetts said Wednesday. 
In the first year, the acquisition will dilute Merrill's earnings by 10 percent on a Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles basis, and just "slightly" on a cash-flow basis, Willetts said following a news conference. 
The GAAP-accounting dilution is expected to decrease to about two percent four years after the deal closes, he 
said. 
On a cash-flow basis, the deal will be "slightly dilutive" in the first year and accretive thereafter. 
Merrill Chairman and Chief Executive David Komansky said after the press conference, "We had an opportunity 
to acquire arguably the best company in the world at what they do. Do you pass up this type of opportunity on an 
accounting convention?" 
According to First Call, analysts' consensus estimates for Merrill's earnings are $4.73 per share for 1997 and 
$4.54 for 1998. The company earned $4.04 per share in 1996. 
Mercury has agreed to be acquired by Merrill for $28.76 cash per share. The boards of both companies approved 
the transaction yesterday.

Merrill buying British fund manager for $5.3 billion.

(c) 1997 Reuters Limited 
LONDON (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. said Wednesday it agreed to buy Britain's largest fund manager, 
Mercury Asset Management, in a surprise deal worth about $5.3 billion. 
The offer, unanimously recommended to shareholders by the Mercury board, will create the world's third largest 
fund management company with combined assets of $450 billion. 
The acquisition will give Merrill, which last year made profits of $1.6 billion, a leading position in the British fund 
management market, broadening its overall range of products and services outside the United States and 
enhancing its growth prospects in Europe and Asia. 
Mercury's clients include five of the largest pension funds in the world and 25 of the largest Japanese corporate 
pension funds. 
The fund management industry is seeing strong growth in many countries around the world as a result of 
deregulation, more investments by individuals saving for retirement and reductions in state benefits. 
"The combination of Mercury and Merrill Lynch significantly advances both organizations' strategic objective of 
becoming the premier global provider of asset management services," Merrill Lynch said in a statement. 
Expanding its asset management division was described by one Merrill executive as its "single highest priority" in 
the past year and he said it had considered dozens of fund management firms before setting its sights on 
Mercury. 
Merrill Chairman David Komansky said the British fund manager was an ideal fit. 
"We believe that the acquisition of Mercury will leave us uniquely positioned to capitalize on the substantial 
worldwide growth opportunities that we see ahead in the asset management business," he said. 
Mercury Chairman Hugh Stevenson said the purchase would create an investment management business with 
combined resources and expertise that would have taken years for either company to achieve on its own. 
He promised that there would be continuity of management and no layoffs following the deal. 
The new fund management group, Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management, will be headquartered in London 
and headed by two senior Mercury executives, Carol Galley and Stephen Zimmerman, currently vice chairman 
and deputy chairman of Mercury. 
They will also join Merrill's executive management committee. 
Stevenson will remain as non-executive chairman of Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management for a year after 
the acquisition to oversee the integration of the two businesses. 
Mercury will continue to operate under its own name in Britain. The group, which last year made profits of 171 
million pounds ($290 million), employs 1,300 in 19 offices around the world. 
It is, however, dwarfed by Merrill's 54,200 employees in more than 750 offices in 45 countries.

Mercury is the second major British banking firm to be taken over by Merrill, marking another blow for British 
ownership of the world's leading financial institutions. 
In 1995 Merrill bought brokerage Smith New Court in a 500 million pound ($880 million) deal. Since then Morgan 
Grenfell, SG Warburg, Kleinwort Benson and Barings have all been swallowed up by foreign banks. 
Merrill offered 17 pounds ($28.81) cash for each Mercury share, a premium of 32 percent above Tuesday's 
closing price. 
Mercury's shares jumped on news of the bid, adding 386 pence to 16.80 pounds ($27.12). Shares of other British 
fund managers also rose amid heightened expectations of further consolidation in the industry. 
Merrill Lynch stock rose $1.31 to $67.50 in midday composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

(c) 1997 Reuters Limited 
LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - U.S. investment banking giant Merrill Lynch snapped up Britain's largest fund 
manager, Mercury Asset Management (MAM), on Wednesday in a surprise 3.1 billion pound ($5.3 billion) deal. 
The offer, which has been unanimously recommended to shareholders by the MAM board, will create the world's 
third largest fund management groups with combined assets of $450 billion. 
It also marks another blow for British ownership of the world's leading financial institutions. 
Morgan Grenfell, SG Warburg, Kleinwort Benson and perhaps best known of all, Barings, have all been 
swallowed up by foreign banks in recent years. Part of the investment banking arm of Barclays Bank went to 
Credit Suisse First Boston and National Westminster Bank has been rumoured to be considering selling parts of 
its investment banking arm to an overseas company. 
Merrill is offering 17 pounds in cash for each MAM share, a premium of 32 percent on Tuesday's closing price. 
MAM's management, who own around one percent of the group, stand to share over 31 million pounds if the deal 
goes through. 
MAM shares jumped on news of the bid adding 386 pence to 16.80 pound by 1505 GMT. Shares in other UK fund 
managers also rose amid heightened expectations of further consolidation in the industry. 
Merrill said the deal would significantly advance both organisations' strategic objective of becoming the premier 
global provider of asset management services. 
Expanding its asset management division was described by one Merrill executive as its "single highest priority" in 
the past year and he said that it had considered "dozens" of fund management firms before setting its sights on 
MAM. 
David Komansky, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch, said MAM was an ideal strategic fit. 
"We believe that the acquisition of Mercury will leave us uniquely positioned to capitalise on the substantial 
worldwide growth opportunities that we see ahead in the asset management business," he said. 
The fund management industry is seeing strong growth in many countries around the world as a result of 
deregulation, demographic trends and reductions in state welfare provision. 
The acquisition will give Merrill, which last year made profits of $1.6 billion, a leading position in the UK fund 
management market, broadening its overall range of non-U.S. products and services and enhancing its growth 
prospects in European and Asian markets. 
At its year end in March, non-UK institutions of 18.2 billion pounds represented over 20 percent of MAM's funds 
under management. Its clients included five of the 10 largest pension funds in the world and 25 of the largest 50 
Japanese corporate pension funds. 
MAM chairman Hugh Stevenson said the purchase would create an investment management business with a 
depth and breadth of resource and expertise which it would have taken many years for either to have achieved 
alone.

But he promised that there would be continuity of management and no redundancies following the deal. 
The new fund management group, Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management, will be headquartered in London 
and headed by two senior MAM executives, Carol Galley and Stephen Zimmerman, currently vice chairman and 
deputy chairman of MAM. 
They will also join Merrill's executive management committee. 
Hugh Stevenson will remain as non-executive chairman of Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management for a year 
following the acquisition to oversee the integration of the two businesses. 
MAM will continue to operate under the Mercury name in the UK. 
The group, which last year made profits of 171.3 million pounds, employs around 1,300 staff in 19 offices around 
the world. 
It is, however, dwarfed by Merrill's 54,200 employees in more than 750 offices in 45 countries worldwide and is 
the second major British banking player to be taken over by Merrill. 
In 1995 Merrill bought broking house Smith New Court in a 500 million pound deal. 
In that same year, MAM severed ties with SG Warburg, which had owned 75 percent of the stock, after Swiss 
Bank Corp bought Warburg. Warburg's stake was returned to shareholders leaving MAM fully independent. 
That independence has lasted just 2-1/2 years. ($ = 0.590 British Pounds)

LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - U.S. banking giant Merrill Lynch snapped up Britain's largest fund manager, 
Mercury Asset Management (MAM), on Wednesday to form one of the world's biggest fund management 
groups. 
The 3.1 billion pound ($5.3 billion) deal will create a combined group with $450 billion under management, 
ranking it number three globally. 
MAM directors, who own around one percent of the group, stand to share 31 million pounds when the deal goes 
through. 
The new fund management group, Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management, will be headquartered in London 
and headed by two senior MAM executives, Carol Galley and Stephen Zimmerman, currently vice chairman and 
deputy chairman of MAM. 
Galley has been dubbed one of Britain's most powerful businesswomen, capable of making or breaking even the 
largest companies. 
High profile scalps of the 48 year-old fund manager include Sir Rocco Forte, who lost his family business Forte 
when Galley sided with Granada's hostile bid for the company. 
She rose from inauspicious beginnings, working in the library of the investment bank after university to become 
one of the industry's top earners, collecting six million pounds last year. 
Zimmerman is another high-earner, who like Galley shuns the limelight but wields extraordinary power through 
MAM's 100 billion pounds of investing power. 
He has been deputy chairman since 1990, joining the firm, then part of merchant bank SG Warburg, in 1971, the 
same year as Galley. 
In addition to the immediate windfall from the merger, both can expect to receive large incentives to tie 
themselves to the future group for the foreseeable future. 
Today's deal marks another blow for British ownership of the world's leading financial institutions which has 
dwindled alarmingly recently. 
Morgan Grenfell, SG Warburg, Kleinwort Benson and perhaps best known of all, Barings, have all been 
swallowed up by foreign banks in the past few years alone. 
David Komansky, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch, said the acquisition of MAM would enable the 
combined group to capitalise on the substantial worldwide growth opportunities in asset management. 
The industry has seen strong growth in countries around the world as a result of deregulation, demographic 
trends and reductions in state welfare provision. 
The acquisition will give Merrill, which last year made profits of $1.6 billion, a leading position in the UK fund 
management market, broadening its overall range of non-U.S. products and services and enhancing its growth 
prospects in European and Asian markets.

Formed in the early 1970s, MAM has long ranked among the best performing British fund managers but despite 
its 1,300 staff in 19 offices around the world it is dwarfed by U.S. powerhouse, Merrill. 
It employs over 54,000 in more than 750 offices in 45 countries worldwide and last year made some $1.6 billion of 
profits. 
Not content with having over $1.0 trillion in private client funds under management in the United States, Merrill 
boasts a strong position in international debt and equity underwriting and trading and in mergers and acquisitions. 
Like its Wall Street peers, Merrill leverages its strong U.S. position successfully around the world and in recent 
years has made a big effort to internationalise its operations. 
The firm has been run since April by Komansky, 57, who is said to be the typical Merrill man -- clever but low 
key, remarkably similar to the publicity shy top management of MAM. 
In 1987 when 25 percent of MAM was first floated on the stock market by parent SG Warburg, funds under 
management at 21.4 billion pounds were barely a fifth of today's total. 
But such was its importance to the group that MAM's opposition helped scupper Morgan Stanley's planned 
acquisition of its parent company. 
While not the first major British banking player to be swallowed by Merrill, which bought broking house Smith New 
Court in a 500 million pound deal in 1995, MAM has promised continuity of management following the merger. 
In 1995, MAM severed ties with SG Warburg, which still held 75 percent of the stock, after Swiss Bank Corp 
bought it. Warburg's stake was returned to shareholders leaving MAM fully independent. 
That independence has lasted just 2-1/2 years. ($ = 0.590 British Pounds)

LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Hugh Stevenson, chairman of Mercury Asset Management Group Plc (MAM) said 
on Wednesday there would be continuity of management and no redundancies following the merger with U.S. 
investment bank Merrill Lynch. 
Stevenson, speaking at a press conference after the announcement of a 3.1 billion pound agreed bid for MAM, 
said the London-based fund manager would continue to operate under the Mercury name in the UK. 
And MAM would retain complete independence in terms of the investment management process, he promised. 
"We were owned by another firm for many years and it's only in the last 2-1/2 years that we've not had a very 
significant parent company," said Stevenson. 
Today's deal, which Merrill said it expected to close by January, enables MAM to achieve its ambition of 
becoming one of the world's leading fund management investment groups, said Stevenson. 
"It gives access to U.S and other markets and Merrill's capital and technological resources. It's a very good deal 
for MAM's shareholders and we believe the cash price is fair and reasonable," he said. 
The two firms shared a common culture in which clients always came first, he said. 
Merrill Lynch chairman and chief executive David Komansky hinted that shareholders could anticipate 20 
percent growth for the combined group, adding that he thought Merrill was getting "excellent value" for its 
investment. 
In the past, MAM had looked at expanding into the U.S. for a number of years and had had hundreds of firms 
offered to it but had never found a deal which matched the criteria set, said Stevenson. 
"This deal is absolutely in accordance with our ambition to grow our business from the base in the UK. It gives us 
quite extraordinary access to the U.S. market and one we could never achieve had we bought any of the firms 
offered to us," he added. 
MAM deputy chairman Stephen Zimmerman said the initial reaction of clients had been favourable and he was 
not expecting to lose clients as a result of the deal. 
In asset terms the combined group will rank number three in the world among active asset managers with $450 
billion under management. 
Merrill claimed it would also have the best balanced portfolio of assets of any group with retail and institutional 
funds split around 50/50 with a similar divisions between dollar and non-dollar and between offshore and onshore 
funds. 
Global business will be conducted under the Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management name. 
The acquisition will give Merrill, which last year made profits of $1.6 billion, a leading position in the UK fund 
management market, broadening its overall range of non-U.S. products and services and enhancing its growth 
prospects in European and Asian markets. 
At its year end in March, non-UK institutions of 18.2 billion pounds represented over 20 percent of MAM's funds 
under management.

Page 56 of 63 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
MAM's clients included five of the ten largest pension funds in the world and 25 of the largest 50 Japanese 
corporate pension funds. 
Zimmerman said alternative asset classes, including possibly passive management, hedge funds and quant 
approaches to the business, would be a growing part of the group's business. 
"We already have two or three in our portfolio and we are clearly going to need to expand that range," he said.

LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said on Wednesday that it had considered dozens of 
fund management firms before deciding to make a bid for Britain's Mercury Asset Management Group Plc . 
The U.S. investment bank said it had set its sights on expanding its asset management division, which it saw as 
one of the most attractive segments of its businesses. 
"We made it our highest single priority for the past year," Merrill Lynch executive vice president of corporate 
strategy Jerome Kenney said of the search. 
"We did an exhaustive analysis as a firm could do," he added. 
The U.S. investment bank launched a cash bid of 3.1 billion pounds, or 17 pounds per share, for Britain's leading 
fund manager. 
The deal, which is expected to close as early as January, would create the world's third largest fund management 
group, with combined assets of $450 billion. 
At a press conference here, executives of both companies emphasised that they could grow their fund 
management businesses faster together than they could separately. 
Asked if Merrill overpaid for Mercury - whose shares closed on Tuesday 31 percent below the bid price - Merrill 
chairman and chief executive David Komansky, said that the offer was based upon "what the two companies 
could do together." 
Speaking from New York via a satellite hook-up, Komansky added, "we think we're getting excellent value." 
The executives confirmed that serious talks started last summer and turned intensive during the last few weeks. 
They said they expected the industry, which has been undergoing profound changes, to be dominated by only a 
handful of firms once the consolidation runs its course.

Merrill thunders to make bulge bigger.

LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch, the "thundering herd" of Wall Street legend, on Wednesday 
strengthened its position as a leading member of the "bulge bracket" global securities firms by snapping up British 
fund manager Mercury Asset Management. 
Not content with having over $1.0 trillion in private client funds under management in the United States, a 
milestone it recently passed, Merrill has now created an institutional funds group with some $450 billion under its 
wing. 
This must be added to its strong position in international debt and equity underwriting and trading and in mergers 
and acquisitions -- in short, the biggest securities house in the world. 
And it makes money. In the first nine months of this year Merrill had net earnings of $1.44 billion, a rise of 22.7 
percent over the previous year, and a return on equity of well over 20 percent. 
Like its Wall Street peers, Merrill leverages its strong U.S. position successfully around the world and in recent 
years has made a big effort to internationalise its operations. 
In 1995 it paid over 500 million pounds ($847.4 million) for British equity broker Smith New Court and has since 
bought leading Spanish securities firm FG Inversiones, Carnegie Italia and has made investments in other firms 
from Thailand to South Africa. 
The firm has leading positions in many markets, not least in international bond offerings where it leads the league 
table this year with over $50 billion in 281 deals according to Capital Data Bondware. 
Founded in 1914 by Wall Street bond salesman Charles Merrill who was joined as a partner six months later by 
Edmund Lynch, the firm immediately embarked on a policy of attracting small investors. 
It sold this retail business in 1930 to brokerage E.A. Pierce and came through the Depression as an investment 
bank. 
In 1940 it merged with Pierce and later with other houses like Fenner and Beane, coming to be known as Merrill 
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith. 
Merrill was the first member of the New York Stock Exchange to go public in 1971, having diversified into 
government bonds and real estate lending in the 1960s. 
Business boomed in the 1980s with Merrill becoming a major player in international offerings, advising on the 
biggest deal of all -- the leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts of RJR Nabisco. 
The firm has been run since April by David Komansky, 57, who is said to be the typical Merrill man -- clever but 
low key -- is now the envy of many. 
"There are a lot of people who would kill for Merrill's distribution capabilities and their fund management 
operation," said one London-based investment banker. 
But it hasn't all been one-way traffic.

Page 59 of 63 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Earlier this year, Merrill agreed to pay $30 million to settle an investigation into its role in the bankruptcy of 
Orange County in California which lost $1.6 billion on risky investments. 
It thus avoided any criminal charges but has since then been fighting hard to keep grand jury transcripts of the 
case secret. 
But most observers see the Orange County rumpus as a blip in the Merrill story. 
The Mercury acquisition makes sense in the Merrill strategy, providing the firm with a platform to capitalise on, 
further diversifying income and making that income more fee-based, something it has been trying to do more and 
more since the 1987 stock market crash. ($ = 0.590 British Pounds)

LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch on Wednesday launched a 3.1 billion pound 
($5.3 billion) bid for one of Britain's leading fund managers Mercury Asset Management (MAM). 
The offer, which has been unanimously recommended to shareholders by the MAM board, will create one of the 
world's largest fund management groups with combined assets of $450 billion. 
It also marks the end of British ownership of another leading financial player. 
Britain's Barclays Bank has already admitted defeat in its quest to be a global player on the investment banking 
stage with the sale of its BZW operations and National Westminster Bank is similarly rumoured to be mulling the 
sale of its own underperforming investment banking arm NatWest Markets. 
Merrill is offering 17 pounds in cash for each MAM share, a premium of 32 percent on Tuesday's closing price. 
It said the deal would significantly advance both organisations' strategic objective of becoming the premier global 
provider of asset management services. 
David Komansky, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch said MAM was an ideal strategic fit. 
"We believe that the acquisition of Mercury will leave us uniquely positioned to capitalise on the substantial 
worldwide growth opportunities that we see ahead in the asset management business," he said. 
In many countries, the fund management industry is experiencing rapid growth, fuelled by deregulation, 
demographic trends and reductions in state welfare provision. 
News of the deal pushed shares in MAM up 30 percent to 1680p in heavy volume by 0930 GMT. Shares in other 
UK fund managers also rose amid heightened expectations of further consolidation in the industry, dealers said. 
MAM chairman Hugh Stevenson said the purchase would create an investment management business with a 
depth and breadth of resource and expertise which it would have taken many years for either to have achieved 
alone. 
"Investment management as an activity will continue to be independent," he added. 
The new fund management group, Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management, which will be headquartered in 
London, will be headed by two senior MAM executives, Carol Galley and Stephen Zimmerman, currently vice 
chairman and deputy chairman of MAM. 
They will also join Merrill's executive management committee. 
Hugh Stevenson will remain as non-executive chairman of Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management for a year 
following the acquisition to oversee the integration of the two businesses. 
MAM, which last year made profits of 171.3 million pounds, employs around 1,300 staff in 19 offices around the 
world. 
It is, however, dwarfed by Merrill's 54,200 employees in more than 750 offices in 45 countries worldwide and is 
the second major British banking player to be swallowed by Merrill.

strong new U.S. and global distribution channels. ($ = 0.590 British Pounds)

MERRILL LYNCH looks set to create the first true global investment management company following its cash 
offer of GBP 3.11 billion ($5.27 billion) for Mercury Asset Management (MAM), the UK's largest independent 
fund management company. It may also have established a new price benchmark for future cross-border deals 
involving asset management companies. 
Acceptance of the offer - which received a unanimous acceptance from Mercury directors - would create one of 
the largest fund management groups in the world with combined assets under management of around $450 
billion. 
"The combination of Mercury and Merrill Lynch will create one of the largest asset management companies in 
the world," said David Komansky, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch. 
"For Merrill Lynch, Mercury is an ideal strategic fit and the acquisition represents a quantum leap towards our 
goal of becoming a global leader in the asset management business, one of the most attractive segments of the 
financial services industry. It also dramatically expands the range of products and services we are able to offer 
our clients around the world." 
Merrill is certainly putting a considerable premium on the attainment of this objective. Its offer amounts to a 31.7 
percent premium on Mercury's share price of 18 November, or 3.34 percent of Mercury's total assets under 
management. At the end of September these amounted to GBP 104.4 billion. 
By way of comparison, Liechtenstein Global Trust (LGT), which announced on 17 November that it was putting its 
asset management division up for sale, was reported in a Zurich newspaper to be looking for a price of between 1 
percent and 2 percent of assets under management (see page 7). 
On the face of it, the offer has much to commend it. Both Merrill Lynch and Mercury's businesses are 
complementary. A merger would enable each company to close significant gaps in its business mix. 
Merrill, which has over $272 billion of assets under management, is very strong in the US, but has only a limited 
presence in the UK and mainland Europe. 
Mercury, which in addition to being a major institution in both the UK's institutional and retail markets, has also 
been making significant progress on mainland Europe. It has also established a relatively strong presence in the 
Australian and Japanese pension fund markets with the prospect of further growth to come. 
Mercury has so far failed to establish a significant presence in the US market, however. "For years, people have 
been asking how we will gain greater access to the US," said Hugh Stevenson, Mercury's chairman. "This does it 
at one stroke." 
Although the deal will result in the demise of the UK's largest independent fund manager, it will reinforce London's 
presence as the premier global international fund management centre. The merged company, which will be called 
Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management (MLMAM), will be headquartered in London. 
And Mercury executives will provide MLMAM with its senior management. Carol Galley and Stephen Zimmerman, 
Mercury's vice chairman and deputy chairman will head the company and join Merrill's executive management 
committee. Hugh Stevenson will assume the role of chairman of the company to oversee the integration of the 
two businesses. 
The deal should also end the lingering uncertainty about Mercury's future. The company has been courted before, 
most notably by Morgan Stanley.

A projected merger between Morgan and SG Warburg was motivated primarily by the latter's 75 percent stake in 
MAM. Following Swiss Bank Corporation's purchase of Warburg in 1995, Warburg's stake in MAM was returned 
to shareholders, leaving the company totally independent. 
The deal also raises questions about the survival of an independent UK fund management presence, however. 
Only a day before the Merrill offer was announced, David Mossop, chief executive of Perpetual, another UK 
independent fund manager, announced that possible changes to the UK savings market could force it to seek a 
merger. 
The new Labour government is about to detail plans for the establishment of a tax advantaged Individual Savings 
Account (ISA). There are fears that this could prejudice fund managers, which have profited greatly from the 
existing Personal Equity Plan (PEP) regime, compared with banks, building societies and insurance companies.
