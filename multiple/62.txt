Dec. 23--United Technologies Corp. is bringing on a new top-level lawyer who has extensive experience dealing 
with antitrust and international competition issues, the Hartford-based company said Monday. 
Debra A. Valentine, a former general counsel for the Federal Trade Commission now with a major law firm in 
Washington, D.C., will serve as UTC's associate general counsel at a time when UTC has made clear it is looking 
for acquisitions. 
Talking to Wall Street analysts earlier this month, George David, chairman of the company whose divisions 
include Pratt & Whitney and Otis Elevator, said UTC sees an improving climate for mergers and acquisitions. 
Among the top priorities is building its Chubb PLC global security business. UTC bought London-based Chubb 
this year. 
Valentine now is a partner with O'Melveny & Myers LLP. When she joins UTC on Jan. 12, she will report to 
William H. Trachsel, UTC's senior vice president and general counsel. 
In a statement, Trachsel said Valentine "specialized in antitrust and international competition issues for over a 
decade and a half at the FTC, and in private practice. Her wealth of experience and insight will be particularly 
useful as we continue to grow by acquisition." 
Valentine, 50, worked at O'Melveny & Myers before joining the FTC in 1995. She returned to the law firm in 2001. 
While at the FTC, she served as deputy director for policy planning, as assistant director for international antitrust, 
and then as the commission's first female general counsel. 
In that last role, she was involved in major merger investigations that included AOL-Time Warner, ExxonMobil 
and Boeing-McDonnell Douglas, UTC said.

Defense Contractors and Other Buyers Eye the Appealing Security Industry

Mergers & Acquisitions: The Dealmakers Journal

Few sectors are hotter than the $150 billion global security industry in the post-9/11 world. United Technologies 
Corp.'s $1 billion acquisition of U.K.-based Chubb PLC, announced last summer, is one of the latest and 
strongest signs that the security sector continues to have a rich supply of targets for opportunistic buyers. 
However, there has been a flurry of m&a activity in many key security sectors - with dealmaking prior to the 2001 
terrorist attacks dominated by inbound deals, mostly from Europe. 
Another high-profile deal that symbolizes the m&a trend found defense contractor General Dynamics Corp. 
ponying up $1.2 billion to buy Veridian Corp., an intelligence-gathering firm. And Lockheed Martin Corp. acquired 
intelligence and security firm Titan Corp. for $1.8 billion. 
The United Technologies bid was aided by a warning of lower profits by Chubb shortly after negotiations began. 
Still, United Technologies' chairman and CEO, George David, said, "We love the overlaps in our customer 
populations. United Technologies already sells to an exceptionally high number of buildings in the world, and 
Chubb's installations will both overlap with and augment this large presence." 
"This is one of the key acquisitions that will shape the industry going forward. If United runs with the ball and 
grows the business, it could become a major security company in the U.S.," says Jack Mallon, a Principal at 
Mallon Capital in New York. 
United Technologies is a diversified company that makes building systems and aerospace products. The 
company includes units that produce Otis elevators and escalators, Carrier heating and air-conditioning 
equipment, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, Sikorsky helicopters, and other products. Chubb, once a part of 
Williams PLC, is a market leader in electronic security products and fire protection in Canada, Hong Kong, 
Australia, and Europe. Chubb also runs a security guard business, employing about 27,000 guards, mostly 
outside of the U.S. 
"We expect United Technologies to cross-sell Chubb's security offerings to customers that are already using their 
Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioning systems," says Paul N. Nisbet, a defense industry analyst at JSA 
Research, a Newport, R.I.-based provider of aerospace equity research. 
One aspect of the deal that appeals to United Technologies, Nisbet says, is that Chubb's operations are not 
linked to the cycle of the aerospace and defense industry and could be used to counter cyclic downswings in 
these operations. However, Chubb's guard operations don't fit with United Technologies' existing businesses, he 
adds. "The manpower business is foreign to United Technologies, and we wouldn't be surprised if they spin it off. 
There just aren't any synergies there that United Technologies can exploit," he notes. 
Nisbet also says he expects United Technologies to rapidly expand in the U.S., which will pose problems for key 
competitors, such as embattled Tyco International Ltd. and Sweden-based Securitas AB, both of which leveraged 
extensive acquisitions to bulk up security operations in the 1990s. 
Another incentive for United Technologies to grab Chubb, according to Mallon, is that many of United 
Technologies' existing businesses are well-established and low-growth. "The Chubb acquisition puts them in a 
sector that shows great promise and opens up a whole new, high-growth horizon for them," he says. 
Chubb posts flat results 
Chubb was ripe for the picking because since it was spun out by Williams, it hasn't grown much, hasn't improved 
profitability, and hasn't made any acquisitions, Mallon says.

Page 5 of 81 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The United Technologies purchase of Chubb and the General Dynamics acquisition of Veridian reversed the 
recent trend of European companies buying up U.S. security industry assets. 
Securitas, the world's largest security company, took out key guard and investigative players Pinkerton's Inc. and 
Burns International in the U.S. German conglomerate Siemens AG bought STGC. Bosch AG, another German 
player, bought Detection Systems. And, most recently, Danish security company Group 4 Falck AS bought 
Wackenhut Corp., which provides guard services and operates privately owned prison facilities, for $520 million. 
A key reason for the reversal of transatlantic security deal flow is the passage of the Transportation Security Act 
in the wake of the terror attacks. Among other provisions, the far-reaching law precludes foreign-controlled 
companies from providing security at U.S. airports and requires domestic companies to run the security 
operations at all U.S. ports. These provisions stem from dissatisfaction in Congress and the government over 
security services provided at airports by foreign-based firms before 9/11. 
In addition to this legislative barrier, Mallon says, the stocks of the large European security companies have 
weakened, which leaves them with less buying power. 
The tilt among U.S. security officials to be more sensitive to using U.S.-based security companies is 
complemented by the recognition by U.S. defense contracting giants that they can exploit existing personnel and 
skill sets to jump into the security space. 
Motivated by the approximately $38 billion earmarked for homeland security, companies like Boeing Co., 
Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp., and Raytheon Co. have either expanded existing security 
operations or bolted on new units. 
But one security expert says it can be a challenge for corporate managers who lack security experience to dive 
into the field. 
"Often the end user is left out of the calculations when security companies merge," says Judith A. Matheny, a 
professor of criminal justice at Remington College in Denver. She says that when security professionals are laid 
off after a merger, customers often are left with managers who can install a given securities system but are 
unable to see how the various components work together. 
The large defense contractors are jumping into security because for them it is just another engineering discipline, 
says Dave Aggleton, head of Aggleton & Associates, a New York-based security consulting firm. He notes that 
with their expertise in vying for large government contracts and workforces that include electrical, physical, and 
other types of engineers who can turn their skills to security assignments, the move into security is a natural 
progression for defense companies. 
Mallon says that there is increased public awareness of homeland security issues and investors have become 
more educated about the sector. Also boning up on security companies, he says, are private equity companies, 
which are mulling investments in the space. 
Because of the preference for domestic contractors, defense contractors' familiarity with applying for and winning 
large government contracts, and hostile conditions in the post-Iraq-war world, Mallon says he expects that other 
defense companies will be forced to respond to the United Technologies-Chubb deal with acquisitions. 
Not to be overlooked, industry experts counsel that there are the thousands of small security companies that are 
ripe material for consolidation. "It's a fragmented industry with low barriers to entry, so we'll see considerable m&a 
activity in upcoming years," Angleton says. 
With some 10,000 alarm companies and another 10,000 small guard companies, there is no shortage of targets 
in the industry. Not only are there tons of players, but some of the apparent consolidators of the last few years 
have stepped out of the field. 
Western Resources Inc.'s 1997 acquisition of Protection One Inc. was an example of a strategy pursued by 
utilities to use security services as an added offering that could be bundled with gas and electric service. In the 
wake of the Enron Corp. meltdown and the California energy crisis, the deregulation of the electric utility industry 
has slowed, and with it the plans of utilities to expand into new lines of business, such as security. 
Mallon says he expects to see a rapid pace of consolidation among computer security companies. Another 
sub-section of the industry, biometrics, a technology devoted to identification of individuals using biological traits, 
also should be a fertile source of deals, he adds.

Another promising area for smaller security companies is security systems integration. "The government is 
spending tons of money on electronic security and, as a result, we're seeing a huge increase in demand for 
companies that can make these systems work together," says William F. Bozeman, a New Orleans-based 
security consultant. 
The bottom line is that absent an improvement in local and worldwide political conditions, the security industry will 
continue to expand, with buyouts and structural changes driven by increased attention and higher investment 
levels.

Utd Tech Sees 2003 Acquisition Spending Around $2.5B 
Utd Tech Sees 2003 Acquisition Spending Around $2.5B

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- United Technologies Corp. (UTX) is banking that a combination of market recovery, 
global expansion and acquisitions will help fuel further growth. 
Chief Executive George David sounded a more boldly upbeat note on the long-awaited economic recovery than 
some executives, though he said orders and business aren't yet reflecting an upturn. 
But it looks like a sure thing next year, David told investors at a Morgan Stanley conference. 
"I cannot imagine that the U.S. economy is not going to bounce in 2004. I've never seen so much stimulus," he 
said. 
Aerospace, making up roughly 40% of the Hartford, Conn., company's sales, is still in a deep slump. 
Aftermarket business may begin to come back in the second half of 2004, David said. But for original equipment 
manufacturing, he said, it will be "at least a couple of years until have a robust order cycle in aircraft." 
At the Dow component's Carrier heating, ventilation and air conditioning arm, pricing pressure means it likely can't 
increase operating margin this year as much as hoped, CEO David said. 
The company, whose products also include elevators, helicopters and aircraft engines, earlier Thursday 
reaffirmed its 2003 earnings forecast and said it expects to maintain its share buyback program. 
For acquisitions, David said United Technologies will probably spend around $2.5 billion this year, compared with 
an initially planned $3 billion. The bulk was already poured into the roughly $2 billion acquisition of London-based 
security company Chubb PLC this summer, paid in cash and by assumption of debt. 
Ongoing acquisitions, likely around $2 billion a year, from free cash flow should fund about 6% annual sales 
growth going forward, David said. 
Talking about Chubb PLC, CEO David predicted synergies from it having a common customer base with other 
United Technologies commercial customers and much potential. But he said there is much to be done to improve 
the company, and that could entail some executive shuffling over the next year. 
"This company has not been exceptionally well run," he said. "I see tremendous potential for improvement." 
One pending decision will be whether to keep Chubb's security guarding operations. 
It "may or may not be a keeper," he said. 
Investors should expect to hear more on its plan for Chubb at a meeting in February, he said. 
David was also enthusiastic about growth prospects in China, saying, "I think it's going to be a great economy for 
the next 20 years." 
United Technologies has posted double-digit operating profit growth in China and also expects to sustain a 
double-digit operating margin there, he said.

David also sees major potential from another, less talked about area in markets from China to Italy - air 
conditioning. 
"I think we are in the infancy of air conditioning," he said.

PHOENIX (AP) - United Technologies Corp. on Thursday reaffirmed its per-share earnings outlook for the year of 
between $4.55 and $4.80. 
The consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call is $4.65. 
George David, chairman and chief executive of the Hartford-based conglomerate, also told analysts at a Morgan 
Stanley conference in Phoenix that United Technologies expects to maintain its share repurchase and acquisition 
programs. 
United Technologies has so far this year paid $250 million to repurchase shares, including those of Chubb PLC, 
which will be the company's seventh unit, a spokesman said. Chubb provides fire and security services for 
commercial and home customers. 
In July, United Technologies reported a modest increase in earnings for the second quarter, citing increasing 
sales of Otis elevators in Asia that helped offset overall weakness in commercial aviation. The corporation, which 
also manufactures Sikorsky helicopters, Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Carrier air conditioners, reported 
earnings of $632 million, or $1.26 per share. 
That compared with $624 million, or $1.23 per share, in the year-ago period. 
United Technologies traded at $78.53 a share, up 71 cents, in mid-afternoon trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange Thursday

United Technologies Wins Stake --- Appointment of Executives To Chubb of U.K. Confirms Its Control Over Company 
United Technologies Wins Stake --- Appointment of Executives To Chubb of U.K. Confirms Its Control

United Technologies Corp. named two executives to top posts at Chubb PLC, as it confirmed that the Hartford, 
Conn., aerospace and building-services concern has acquired a controlling stake in the British company under a 
$1 billion tender offer launched in June. 
Olivier Robert, an executive at United Technologies' Otis elevator subsidiary, was named president of Chubb 
during a meeting of Chubb's board. Akhil Johri, director of investor relations at the parent company, was named 
Chubb's chief financial officer, according to people familiar with the plans. The Chubb board remains the 
company's formal governing body until the acquisition is completed. 
United Technologies announced in June that it had offered slightly more than $1 billion to acquire Chubb, the 
world's third-largest electronic-security company. United Technologies now holds 56% of Chubb's shares 
outstanding and expects to acquire full ownership within weeks. Chubb is applying for delisting from the London 
Stock Exchange, which would take effect on Aug. 27. 
Chubb will be set up as a separate business unit that will stand alongside the company's Otis elevator and 
Carrier air-conditioning businesses. It hasn't been decided whether Chubb's headquarters will move to the 
Hartford area or remain in London. About 40 people work at the London base. 
Chubb, which had $2.5 billion in revenue last year, would be by far the smallest of the $28 billion company's 
segments, which include Pratt & Whitney jet engines in addition to Carrier and Otis. 
United Technologies Chairman and Chief Executive George David hopes to double the size of the Chubb unit 
through acquisitions over the next five years, according to people familiar with his plans. Mr. David hasn't 
indicated which companies he might pursue, but the electronic-security market is highly fragmented, with the top 
10 companies controlling less than 40% of an estimated $35 billion-a-year security-services market. 
A United Technologies spokesman declined to comment. 
Chubb, founded in 1818 by Charles Chubb, has been publicly traded since November 2000, after it was spun off 
from U.K. conglomerate Williams PLC, which had owned it for three years. The company, which is unrelated to 
Chubb Corp. of the U.S., provides a full range of security-services for commercial and home customers, including 
24-hour monitoring, card-access systems and closed-circuit television systems. 
With the addition of Chubb, which employs 48,000 people, United Technologies' total employment would be 
203,000, with more than 60% of the employees living outside the U.S. Chubb's principal business operations are 
in Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. 
Mr. David said in a recent interview that he believes that Chubb's business mix, which relies heavily on monthly 
commercial service contracts, will fit in well with the high-profit-margin business model of the company's Otis and 
Carrier units. "I think that our ability to carry Chubb into buildings as part of our overall services will be high," he 
said.

UTC Will Move New Acquisition Chubb PLC

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - United Technologies Corp. plans to move the corporate headquarters of recently 
acquired Chubb PLC to Connecticut within a year after taking control of the London-based electronic security 
provider as part of a $1 billion offer. 
The aerospace and manufacturing conglomerate also will seek to double the size of Chubb, UTC chief executive 
George David told The Associated Press on Monday. UTC intends to boost growth at Chubb with acquisitions in 
the next five or six years, David said. 
"We feel to develop the Chubb business as a separate segment, we need lots of resources and horsepower," he 
said. "The contracts, deals, resources are in Hartford, not in the comparatively small headquarters in London." 
Chubb, which employs about 40 workers in its London office and approximately 48,000 workers in Europe and 
Asia, will move its headquarters to the Hartford area, David said. 
Chubb will be established as United Technologies' seventh unit. Otis, Carrier, UTC Power, Pratt & Whitney, 
Hamilton Sundstrand and Sikorsky are all based in Connecticut. 
In 2004, Chubb also will be a separate UTC segment for financial reporting purposes. 
UTC will work to increase Chubb's operating margin of 7 percent - a tool used to measure pricing and efficiency - 
to the 11 percent-to-17 percent range of UTC, David said. 
"We need to go after this thing hard, to get a good hard hold of the operating income margin," he said. 
Chubb, which brought in $2.5 billion in revenue last year, is the smallest of the $28 billion company's segments. 
The revenue is "on the thin size, but we'll make it bigger," David said. 
UTC on Monday also named two of its executives to top positions at Chubb. 
Olivier Robert, 52, the senior vice president of engineering and operations at UTC's Otis Elevator subsidiary since 
1997, will be named as Chubb's president, the company said. 
Akhil Johri, the UTC director of investor relations, will be named to the post of chief financial officer. Johri, 42, has 
held the same post at Carrier Corp.'s Asia Pacific operations. 
UTC shares closed Monday at $76.66, up $1.02 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Chubb planned to delist the company from the London Stock Exchange Monday, effective Aug. 27. Chubb, 
founded in 1818, has been publicly traded since November 2000, after it was spun off from United Kingdom 
conglomerate Williams PLC, which had owned it for three years. 
The company, which is unrelated to Chubb Corp. of the U.S., provides fire and security services for commercial 
and home customers, including monitoring, card-access systems and closed-circuit television systems.

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - United Technologies Corp. plans to move the corporate headquarters of recently 
acquired Chubb PLC to Connecticut within a year as it takes tight control of the London-based electronic security 
provider. 
The aerospace and manufacturing conglomerate also will seek to double the size of Chubb, which it acquired in a

UTC on Monday also named two of its executives to top positions at Chubb. 
Olivier Robert, 52, the senior vice president of engineering and operations at UTC's Otis Elevator subsidiary since 
1997, will be named as Chubb's president, the company said. 
Akhil Johri, the UTC director of investor relations, will be named to the post of chief financial officer. Johri, 42, has 
held the same post at Carrier Corp.'s Asia Pacific operations. 
UTC and Chubb management planned a Sept. 30 conference call to provide further details about the integration. 
UTC shares closed Monday at $76.66, up $1.02 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Chubb, founded in 1818, has been publicly traded since November 2000, after it was spun off from United 
Kingdom conglomerate Williams PLC, which had owned it for three years.

Two United Technologies Corp. executives are expected to be named to top posts at Chubb PLC, following an 
announcement today that the U.S. aerospace and building-services concern has acquired a controlling stake in 
the British company under a $1 billion (868.8 million euro) tender offer launched in June. 
Olivier Robert, an executive at United Technologies' Otis elevator subsidiary, is expected to be named president 
of Chubb during a meeting of the electronic-security company's board. Akhil Johri, director of investor relations at 
the parent company, is expected to be named Chubb's chief financial officer, according to people familiar with the 
plans. The Chubb board remains the company's formal governing body until the acquisition is completed. 
United Technologies, Hartford, Connecticut, announced in June that it had offered slightly more than $1 billion to 
acquire Chubb. United Technologies now holds 56% of Chubb's shares outstanding and expects to acquire full 
ownership within weeks. Chubb is expected to apply for delisting from the London Stock Exchange today, which 
would take effect Aug. 27. 
People familiar with the situation said United Technologies Chairman and Chief Executive George David plans to 
set up Chubb as a separate business unit that will stand alongside the company's Otis elevator and Carrier 
air-conditioning businesses. It hasn't been decided whether Chubb's headquarters will move to the Hartford area 
or remain in London. About 40 people work at the London headquarters. 
Chubb, which brought in $2.5 billion in revenue last year, would be by far the smallest of the $28 billion 
company's segments, which also include Pratt & Whitney jet engines. 
Mr. David hopes to double Chubb's size through acquisitions over the next five years, according to people 
familiar with his plans. Mr. David hasn't indicated which companies he might pursue, but the electronic-security 
market is highly fragmented, with the top 10 companies controlling less than 40% of an estimated $35 
billion-a-year security-services market. 
A United Technologies spokesman declined to comment. 
Chubb, founded in 1818 by Charles Chubb, has been publicly traded since November 2000, after it was spun off 
from U.K. conglomerate Williams PLC, which had owned it for three years. The company, which is unrelated to 
Chubb Corp. of the U.S., provides fire and security services for commercial and home customers, including 
24-hour monitoring, card-access systems and closed-circuit television systems. 
With the addition of Chubb, which employs 48,000, United Technologies' total work force would be 203,000, with 
more than 60% of the employees living outside the U.S. Chubb's principal business operations are in Europe, 
Asia, Australia and New Zealand. 
Mr. David said in a recent interview that he believes Chubb's business mix, which relies on monthly commercial 
service contracts, will fit in well with the high-profit-margin business model of the Otis and Carrier units. "I think 
that our ability to carry Chubb into buildings as part of our overall services will be high," he said.

UPDATE 1-United Tech ready to spur Chubb's growth.

BOSTON, July 28 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp. (UTX.N) executives said on Monday the conglomerate 
would make "significant acquisitions" to boost electronic security sales at newly acquired Chubb Plc, whose 
security guard business has drawn interest from prospective buyers. 
"Our growth in the U.S. will have to be the result of significant acquisitions," Olivier Robert, the newly named 
president of Chubb, told Reuters in an interview. 
United Tech, which bid $1 billion for London-based Chubb last month, said on Monday the company had become 
a subsidiary of the U.S. conglomerate, which makes everything from Otis elevators to Pratt & Whitney jet engines. 
Chubb, a market leader in electronic security in Canada, Hong Kong and Australia, has only a small presence in 
the United States. United Tech plans to sell Chubb's products and services to the same U.S. building owners and 
managers who rely on Otis Elevator Co., for example. 
But Chubb's operating performance has been checkered in recent years, in part, because it did a poor job 
integrating the companies it acquired, Robert said. 
United Tech Chairman George David also said Chubb's customer cancellation rate has been too high while the 
company's growth has underperformed industry benchmarks. 
David held up the customer service at Otis as the standard for Chubb to attain. Otis responds to customer 
service calls in the United States and Canada in an average time of about 30 minutes on nearly 600,000 requests 
per year, the company said. 
With annual sales of about $2.5 billion, Chubb will be the smallest of United Tech's operating subsidiaries. But 
David said ambitious growth plans have been discussed at the company's headquarters in Hartford, Connecticut. 
"We've talked about numbers, like doubling the sales in a four-or five-year time period," David said. 
Meanwhile, United Tech and Chubb's new management team will assess the value of Chubb's security guard 
business, which employs about 27,000 guards. 
"We need to understand how this man guarding business can feed the electronic security part of the business, 
which is obviously what we're interested in and which is the growing part of the market," Robert said. "We'll 
probably take two or three months before we make any decision whether we keep or sell this business." 
David said the company has received inquiries from "qualified players." 
"And I think divestiture could be managed attractively and quickly should that be the decision," David said.

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP)--United Technologies Corp. (UTX) plans to move the corporate headquarters of recently 
acquired Chubb PLC (U.CHU) to Connecticut within a year after taking control of the London-based electronic 
security provider as part of a $1 billion offer. 
The aerospace and manufacturing conglomerate also will seek to double the size of Chubb, UTC Chief Executive 
George David told The Associated Press on Monday. UTC intends to boost growth at Chubb with acquisitions in 
the next five or six years, David said. 
"We feel to develop the Chubb business as a separate segment, we need lots of resources and horsepower," he 
said. "The contracts, deals, resources are in Hartford, not in the comparatively small headquarters in London." 
Chubb, which employs about 40 workers in its London office and approximately 48,000 workers in Europe and 
Asia, will move its headquarters to the Hartford area, David said. 
Chubb will be established as United Technologies' seventh unit. Otis, Carrier, UTC Power, Pratt & Whitney, 
Hamilton Sundstrand and Sikorsky are all based in Connecticut. 
In 2004, Chubb also will be a separate UTC segment for financial reporting purposes. 
UTC will work to increase Chubb's operating margin of 7% - a tool used to measure pricing and efficiency _ to the 
11% to 17% range of UTC, David said. 
"We need to go after this thing hard, to get a good hard hold of the operating income margin," he said. 
Chubb, which brought in $2.5 billion in revenue last year, is the smallest of the $28 billion company's segments. 
The revenue is "on the thin size, but we'll make it bigger," David said. 
UTC on Monday also named two of its executives to top positions at Chubb.

1997, will be named as Chubb's president, the company said.

GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan (AP) - Kellogg Co. on Monday said its earnings rose 17.3 percent in the second 
quarter on strong companywide sales growth, beating Wall Street's expectations. 
The cereal giant earned $203.9 million, or 50 cents per share, for the April-June period compared with $173.8 
million, or 42 cents per share, in 2002. 
The results surpassed the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call of 47 cents per share. 
Sales increased 5.8 percent to $2.25 billion from $2.13 billion in 2002. Excluding the translation of foreign 
currency and the impact of two divestitures in the previous year, internal sales growth was up 3.5 percent. 
For the first six months of 2003, the Battle Creek-based company earned $367.8 million, or 90 cents per share, 
compared with $326.4 million, or 79 cents per share, during last year's second quarter. Sales rose 5 percent to 
$4.39 billion from $4.19 billion. 
"We enter the second half of 2003 with solid top-line growth momentum, increasing profitability, substantial 
reinvestment in brand-building and productivity, and improving financial flexibility," said Carlos Gutierrez, 
chairman and chief executive officer. "Because of our strong momentum, we can now turn our sights in the 
second half to more reinvestment for future growth."

Tyson posts lower earnings in third fiscal quarter 
SPRINGDALE, Arkansas (AP) - Tyson Foods Inc., the world's largest meat company, on Monday said its 
third-quarter earnings fell 26 percent from a year ago. 
Excluding one-time items, the results missed narrowly missed the consensus forecast of analysts surveyed by 
Thomson First Call. 
Tyson's earnings fell to $79 million, or 23 cents a share, for the April-June period, down from $107 million, or 30 
cents a share, a year earlier. 
The results included a gain of 8 cents per share from vitamin antitrust litigation, partially offset by a charge of 3 
cents per share related to its closing of a poultry plant in Berlin, Md., and a writedown of 2 cents per share in the 
value of its live swine operation. The net effect was to boost reported earnings by 3 cents a share. 
Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call expected earnings of 21 cents per share for the quarter before one-time 
items. That means Tyson missed the forecast by 1 cent a share, Thomson research analyst Ken Perkins said. 
Sales rose to $6.3 billion from $5.9 billion for its third quarter a year ago. 
The company says it is meeting its targets to bring down its debt. Tyson, a longtime leader in poultry, became the 
world's largest meat company with its 2001 acquisition of South Dakota-based meatpacker IBP Inc. for $3.4 
billion. 
WHITE PLAINS, New York (AP) - ITT Industries Inc. posted a 7 percent rise in second-quarter profit on Monday, 
as strong sales of defense and fluid technology products offset weakness in its electronic components business. 
Net income came to $99.9 million, or $1.06 a share, compared with $92.9 million, or 99 cents a share, in the 
same quarter a year ago. 
The latest results included a gain of 8 cents a share from a benefits-claim settlement and a tax settlement as well 
as a restructuring charge of 4 cents a share. 
The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call was for earnings of $1.02 a share. 
Revenue rose to $1.44 billion from $1.32 billion for the company, which produces military and transportation 
equipment. 
The company's electronic components segment continues to face difficult market conditions, as demand falls for 
its handset connectors and switches in Asia, ITT said. 
However, ITT expects to report earnings, including items, of $3.77 to $3.97 a share this year, up from a prior 
estimate of $3.70 to $3.90 a share. 
ITT earned $379.9 million, or $4.06 a share, including items, on revenue of $4.98 billion for the year ended Dec. 
31. 
Estimated growth of 7 percent to 9 percent would result in revenue of about $5.33 billion to $5.43 billion for 2003. 
Analysts expect ITT to earn $3.86 a share on revenue of $5.26 billion this year.

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - United Technologies Corp. plans to move the corporate headquarters of recently 
acquired Chubb PLC to Connecticut within a year after taking control of the London-based electronic security 
provider as part of a $1 billion offer. 
The aerospace and manufacturing conglomerate also will seek to double the size of Chubb, UTC chief executive 
George David told The Associated Press on Monday. UTC intends to boost growth at Chubb with acquisitions in 
the next five or six years, David said. 
"We feel to develop the Chubb business as a separate segment, we need lots of resources and horsepower," he 
said. "The contracts, deals, resources are in Hartford, not in the comparatively small headquarters in London." 
Chubb, which employs about 40 workers in its London office and approximately 48,000 workers in Europe and 
Asia, will move its headquarters to the Hartford area, David said. 
Chubb will be established as United Technologies' seventh unit. Otis, Carrier, UTC Power, Pratt & Whitney, 
Hamilton Sundstrand and Sikorsky are all based in Connecticut. 
In 2004, Chubb also will be a separate UTC segment for financial reporting purposes. 
UTC will work to increase Chubb's operating margin of 7 percent - a tool used to measure pricing and efficiency - 
to the 11 percent-to-17 percent range of UTC, David said. 
"We need to go after this thing hard, to get a good hard hold of the operating income margin," he said. 
Chubb, which brought in $2.5 billion in revenue last year, is the smallest of the $28 billion company's segments. 
The revenue is "on the thin size, but we'll make it bigger," David said. 
UTC on Monday also named two of its executives to top positions at Chubb. 
Olivier Robert, 52, the senior vice president of engineering and operations at UTC's Otis Elevator subsidiary since 
1997, will be named as Chubb's president, the company said. 
Akhil Johri, the UTC director of investor relations, will be named to the post of chief financial officer. Johri, 42, has 
held the same post at Carrier Corp.'s Asia Pacific operations. 
UTC shares closed Monday at $76.66, up $1.02 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Chubb planned to delist the company from the London Stock Exchange Monday, effective Aug. 27. Chubb, 
founded in 1818, has been publicly traded since November 2000, after it was spun off from United Kingdom 
conglomerate Williams PLC, which had owned it for three years. 
The company, which is unrelated to Chubb Corp. of the U.S., provides fire and security services for commercial 
and home customers, including monitoring, card-access systems and closed-circuit television systems.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Union Commission Tuesday approved U.S. industrial equipment 
company United Technologies Corporation's (UTX) purchase of British fire protection company Chubb PLC 
(U.CHU). 
The deal is worth $1 billion in cash as well as the assumption of $934 million in debt. United Technologies will pay 
about $1.23 a share. 
U.S. antitrust authorities have already approved the deal. 
"Chubb's installations will both overlap with and augment (UTC's) large presence. We see lots of potential for 
synergies," said George David, chairman and CEO of United Technologies. 
Chubb has a near 200-year history and worldwide brand name recognition as a leading security and fire services 
provider. It has over one million customers across 21 countries. Chubb also provides electronic and security 
personnel services. It leads the market in the U.K., Australia, France, Hong Kong and Canada. 
Chubb's "considerable long-term potential is likely to be realized more quickly within a major global group like 
UTC because our limited financial resources have restrained growth," said Chubb Chairman Sir Robert Horton. 
United Technologies employs 155,000 people and operates in more than 180 countries. In 2002, UTC revenues 
totaled $28.2 billion. United Technologies' subsidiaries include elevator and escalator company Otis, air 
conditioning firm Carrier and aircraft engine company Pratt & Whitney. 
The deal was approved under the Commission's simplified antitrust procedure. This clears mergers or 
acquisitions after one month if no objections are raised by third parties.

BOSTON, July 9 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp. (UTX.N) Chairman George David netted about $14.3 
million over the past month from the sale of company stock, according to recent U.S. regulatory filings. 
David's stock sales have totaled about $22.6 million this year as United Tech's shares have risen nearly 18 
percent in 2003. That performance easily beats the Dow Jones industrial average's gain of almost 10 percent so 
far this year. 
Unlike some other U.S. manufacturing conglomerates, Hartford, Connecticut-based United Tech, which makes 
everything from Otis elevators to Black Hawk helicopters, has stuck by its original 2003 profit forecast despite 
turbulence in the commercial airline industry. 
United Tech's $1 billion bid to acquire British-based security group Chubb Plc (CHB.L) also has received a warm 
reception from investors. The deal is expected to reduce United Tech's exposure to the commercial aerospace 
industry. 
Over the past month, David has exercised options to acquire 510,000 company shares for $16 to $17 apiece. The 
options were due to expire early next year, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. 
"If he doesn't exercise the options, they'll expire and he'll lose them," United Tech spokesman Paul Jackson said. 
"But in exercising options, George David routinely increases his holdings in (United Technologies) by retaining a 
significant number of shares from each exercise." 
Of the options exercised, nearly half went toward taxes and the exercise price of the shares. David sold 200,000 
shares on the market at prices between $70.67 and 72.50 each, SEC filings show. 
David still owns about 611,000 United Tech shares. 
United Tech shares fell $1.16, or 1.6 percent, to $72.78 in Wednesday afternoon trade on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

United Technologies Secures a Powerful Lift From Its Elevator Unit --- With Airlines Mired in a Slump, Otis 
Provides Parent With Steady Revenue --- Staying at the Waldorf Since 1931 
By J. Lynn Lunsford

(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -- When the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel opened on Park Avenue in 1931, the 42-story Art Deco 
masterpiece had at its heart a fleet of 30 Otis elevators. 
From the richly decorated salon-size cars that could lift more than 40 socialites at a time, to the austere 
metal-walled cabs that discreetly shuttled bellhops and maids, Otis made the place tick. 
Seventy-two years later, the same elevators are still traveling the shafts -- and still generating income for the 
company that made them. Live attendants were replaced in the 1960s by more reliable controls that anybody 
could operate. During the 1970s and '80s, the doors were modified with mechanisms that required less 
maintenance, and the antiquated brains that made the cars run were replaced with modern computers. Each 
time, Otis racked up more sales. 
"When we put in an elevator, we expect it to run forever -- with us maintaining it and upgrading it," says Mike 
DiZio, an Otis vice president who at 78 years old is still helping the world's largest elevator company close deals. 
For Otis's parent, United Technologies Corp., that formula has been a boon in tough times. As UTC's mainstay 
aerospace businesses are suffering through the worst slump in aviation history, Otis has quietly cushioned UTC's 
bottom line with a steady revenue stream from repairs and upgrades. Otis has become UTC's equivalent of the 
razor-blade business: The sale of each new elevator or escalator opens up the possibility of income from 
maintenance and upgrades that go on for decades and often exceed the original installation price. 
"When you look back on it, Otis has been one of the best investments United Technologies ever made," says 
UTC's chairman and chief executive, George David. 
Mr. David was a 32-year-old Otis senior vice president when UTC went after the company in a 1975 hostile 
takeover. At the time, many investors and analysts viewed the Otis deal as a sign that the aerospace company 
had lost its way. Over its long history, UTC, of Hartford, Connecticut, helped found both Boeing Co. and United 
Airlines, and owns such leading industrial names as engine maker Pratt & Whitney, helicopter firm Sikorsky 
Aircraft and Carrier air conditioning. 
Almost three decades after buying Otis, UTC's financial performance has surpassed that of most of its aerospace 
rivals, due in no small part to a product that could never leave the ground without a cable attached to its roof. Until 
the economic shockwaves caused by Sept. 11, the company posted 28 straight quarters of improving profit 
margins and revenue. In 2002, its operating revenue hit $28.8 billion (24.95 billion euros) and its operating profit 
climbed 13% over the previous year to $3.86 billion; Otis generated nearly a quarter of that revenue and more 
than 27% of the profit. With Otis as its bedrock, UTC's market capitalization now exceeds those of Boeing and 
General Motors Corp. 
In many ways, Otis has pulled off an inside-out takeover of UTC. Mr. David, who ascended to CEO of the 
conglomerate in 1994, forced executives at other business units to apply business practices he learned as a 
young executive at Otis. The company was among the first U.S. manufacturers to embrace Japanese 
lean-manufacturing methods, which are aimed at driving out costly waste and helped to transform the automobile 
industry. UTC even established its own "lean" school in East Hartford, Connecticut, that employees are required 
to attend.

Page 36 of 81 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Otis's broad international presence, with plants and sales offices world-wide, also became a model for UTC. 
When UTC acquired Otis, 97% of the corporation's revenue came from manufacturing operations inside the U.S. 
Today, almost 60% of revenue comes from manufacturing and sales operations outside the U.S., with more than 
half of the company's 155,000 employees working in other countries. That global reach has served the company 
well and has positioned it to take advantage of a high-rise building boom in parts of Asia and Europe. 
Otis, which opened its doors 150 years ago in Yonkers, New York, wasn't the first elevator maker. But it was the 
first to win broad public confidence. Founder Elisha Otis brought his company to prominence with a landmark 
invention: a special braking system that would prevent the cab from crashing to the bottom of the shaft if its rope 
broke. He demonstrated the system by climbing aboard an elevator and severing the rope. 
As public confidence grew, so did the height of buildings. Otis landed numerous big contracts in the early days of 
skyscrapers and established itself as the brand name of choice for big projects. The company installed the first 
elevators in Gustav Eiffel's tower in the late 1880s; the cabs were driven by operators who sat on open-air 
platforms. (Mannequins in period costume now fill the operator's seat in the otherwise modern cars.) Otis also 
introduced the first escalator in 1900 at the Paris Exhibition. 
Today, millions of people daily climb aboard the 1.5 million Otis elevators and 100,000 escalators in use 
world-wide. The company, which gobbles up dozens of small competitors and service companies each year, 
commands 27% of the world-wide new-elevator market. Its biggest competitor, Switzerland's Schindler Group, 
has less than half that share. 
What keeps Otis running smoothly despite ups and downs in the economy is its repair and upgrade business. In a 
slump, people may not build new buildings, but owners of existing buildings still must maintain their elevators. In 
fact, many building owners renovate their elevators during down times to stay competitive with newer properties. 
There are thousands of companies that do such work, from Schindler to mom-and-pop operations with one or two 
service technicians, many of which offer lower prices than Otis does. Otis commands an overwhelming share of 
the long-term-service business largely because of its name recognition. In many cases, building owners don't 
even know who built their elevators, so they call Otis. As a result, Otis services not only most of its own elevators 
but a growing chunk of its competitors' as well. 
Another edge comes from new technology. Last year, UTC as a whole spent $2.5 billion on research, or slightly 
more than it made in net profit. It doesn't break out the numbers by business unit for competitive reasons. 
Otis's cabs are equipped with generators that pump electricity back into the building's power grid each time an 
elevator descends, making the cost of operating them negligible. They have computers that automatically detect 
potential problems, then page a technician before a breakdown occurs. Many buildings also subscribe to Otis 
Line, a 24-hour monitoring service that connects the emergency phones aboard elevators to multilingual 
operators in Connecticut. Operators must pick up within two rings and be able to immediately dispatch help. 
Otis often maintains a profitable relationship with customers for decades. Since the Waldorf-Astoria's elevators 
were installed in the 1930s, Otis technicians have been on call 24 hours a day. In some skyscrapers, Otis 
maintenance men have spent their careers servicing just those buildings. 
Many of Otis's recent innovations are designed to improve elevators' efficiency as businesses try to squeeze 
more employees into existing office space. "You can't exactly install new elevator shafts, so the elevator 
manufacturer has to come up with ways to make the existing elevators do more," says Bo Hish, Otis's general 
manager for new construction in Manhattan. 
In a 2001 advertising campaign, the company showed an elephant suspended above a mouse by a thin rubber 
belt with embedded steel cables. The caption: "The cable weighs less than the mouse." In most high-rises, the 
wheel on which the elevator cable travels is the size of a backyard grill. With the more-flexible belt, that wheel can 
be as small as 10 centimeters in diameter, making it possible for engineers to reduce the size of every component 
that drives the elevators -- and to eliminate the massive machine rooms that currently eat up valuable space on 
the upper floors of skyscrapers. 
Some elevators are programmed to run on varying schedules depending on the time of day. In the early morning 
hours, for example, most elevators wait at the ground floor, to handle the incoming crowds. Later on, perhaps half 
the elevators wait at the bottom while the rest stay near the top to handle employees' short trips between floors. 
New switches and electrical circuits now speed up the operation of the elevator by 35% just by making it start 
moving more quickly after the doors close. For older elevators, Otis sells newly designed roller guides and metal

fairings that make the cabs more aerodynamic as they slide through the shaft. Much of the side-to-side movement 
in older models is the result of air trying to find its way around the moving cab. 
In a skinny, windowless 117-meter tower outside Bristol, Connecticut, Otis engineers subject new models to 
electrical sabotage, simulated earthquakes, fires, flooding and bone-crushing drops. Recently, engineers bolted 
an elevator cab to a vibrating platform that was doing its best to shake the ceiling panels out. In a giant freezer 
nearby, the doors of an ice-coated elevator were repetitively opening and closing in Arctic temperatures. 
Some of the technologies pioneered in Otis's labs have allowed architects to change the way they design 
buildings. Consider the 54-story Roppongi Hills office tower in Tokyo, featuring double-deck elevators developed 
by Otis and Asian construction giant Mori Building. Before the invention of this elevator, architects who chose to 
use double-deck systems were forced by the rigid design of the two-cab elevator to make their floors the same 
height throughout the building. The Roppongi Hills elevators solve this problem with an adjustable scissorlike 
apparatus between the decks that raises or lowers the bottom deck as needed to adjust for floor height. 
For Otis, the Roppongi tower -- one of the tallest and most prestigious projects undertaken in earthquake-prone 
Tokyo in 30 years -- is a major comeback in Japan. Otis had lost sales there in recent years because it couldn't 
meet Japanese demands for ride quality. Unlike passengers in the U.S. and Europe -- who are willing to accept a 
slight jostling in return for a faster ride -- Japanese riders don't want to feel the elevator move at all. The standard 
was hard to achieve, requiring perfectly straight elevator tracks and a ride-control system that damps even the 
slightest motion. 
UTC is trying to position itself to take advantage of a vertical-construction boom it anticipates in Asia as 600 
million people move from farms to cities in the next 20 years. The company recently scored a coup when it landed 
a contract to install 111 elevators and escalators in a massive new shopping mall being built in Guangzhou, 
China. When completed, the mall is expected to be the largest in the world, with an estimated 800,000 people 
flowing through its doors daily. 
UTC faces big challenges in other parts of its business, particularly if Mr. David is to continue keeping his promise 
of 15% increases in annual profit. In October 2000, a proposed $40 billion acquisition of Honeywell International 
Inc. fell through. Since then, the company hasn't come up with a comparable large acquisition that can deliver the 
kind of growth investors expect. 
Instead, the company reached an agreement to buy Chubb PLC, a British electronic-security company, for 
slightly more than $1 billion. The London-based firm, which isn't related to Chubb Corp. of the U.S., provides fire 
and security services for commercial and residential customers, including 24-hour monitoring and card-access 
systems. If the deal goes through, Chubb would be another building service that UTC could offer in addition to 
elevators and air conditioners. 
At the same time, the aviation market is still uncertain, and UTC's longtime flagship, Pratt & Whitney, has 
struggled to keep market share. Mr. David says he is confident that aerospace will come back, and when it does 
he vows the company will be positioned to take advantage of it. In the long run, he says, the less UTC relies on 
any one segment of its business, the better it will be able to weather economic storms. 
But Mr. David remains an elevator salesman at heart. Behind his desk in Hartford is a painting depicting 
downtown Dallas, but three skyscrapers have been edited out. Why? They were equipped with a competitor's 
elevators. "I didn't want to look at those buildings every day, so we just left them out," he says.

NEW YORK -- When the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel opened on Park Avenue in 1931, the 42-story Art Deco 
masterpiece had at its heart a fleet of 30 Otis elevators. 
From the richly decorated salon-size cars that could lift more than 40 socialites at a time, to the austere 
metal-walled cabs that discreetly shuttled bellhops and maids, Otis made the place tick. 
Seventy-two years later, the same elevators are still traveling the shafts -- and still generating income for the 
company that made them. Live attendants were replaced in the 1960s by controls that anybody could operate. 
During the 1970s and '80s, the doors were modified with mechanisms that required less maintenance, and the 
antiquated brains that made the cars run were replaced with modern computers. Each time, Otis racked up more 
sales. 
"When we put in an elevator, we expect it to run forever -- with us maintaining it and upgrading it," says Mike 
DiZio, an Otis vice president who at 78 years old is still helping the world's largest elevator company close deals. 
For Otis's parent, United Technologies Corp., that formula has been a boon in tough times. As UTC's mainstay 
aerospace businesses are suffering through the worst slump in aviation history, Otis has quietly cushioned UTC's 
bottom line with a steady revenue stream from repairs and upgrades. Otis has become UTC's equivalent of the 
razor-blade business: The sale of each new elevator or escalator opens up the possibility of income from 
maintenance and upgrades that go on for decades and often exceed the original installation price. 
"When you look back on it, Otis has been one of the best investments United Technologies ever made," says 
UTC's chairman and chief executive, George David. 
Mr. David was a 32-year-old Otis senior vice president when UTC went after the company in a 1975 hostile 
takeover. At the time, many investors and analysts viewed the Otis deal as a sign that the aerospace company 
had lost its way. Over its long history, UTC, of Hartford, Connecticut, helped found both Boeing Co. and United 
Airlines, and owns such leading industrial names as engine maker Pratt & Whitney, helicopter giant Sikorsky 
Aircraft and Carrier air conditioning. 
Almost three decades after buying Otis, UTC's financial performance has surpassed that of most of its aerospace 
rivals, due in no small part to a product that could never leave the ground without a cable attached to its roof. Until 
the economic shockwaves caused by Sept. 11, the company posted 28 straight quarters of improving profit 
margins and revenue. In 2002, its operating revenue hit $28.8 billion and its operating profit climbed 13% over the 
previous year to $3.86 billion; Otis generated nearly a quarter of that revenue and more than 27% of the profit. 
With Otis as its bedrock, UTC's market capitalization now exceeds those of Boeing and General Motors Co. 
In many ways, Otis has pulled off an inside-out takeover of UTC. Mr. David, who ascended to CEO of the 
conglomerate in 1994, forced executives at other business units to apply business practices he learned as a 
young executive at Otis. The company was among the first U.S. manufacturers to embrace Japanese 
lean-manufacturing methods, which are aimed at driving out costly waste and helped transform the automobile 
industry. UTC even established its own "lean" school in East Hartford, Connecticut, that employees are required 
to attend. 
Otis's broad international presence, with plants and sales offices world-wide, also became a model for UTC. 
When UTC acquired Otis, 97% of the corporation's revenue came from manufacturing operations inside the U.S.

Page 39 of 81 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Today, almost 60% of revenue comes from manufacturing and sales operations outside the U.S., with more than 
half of the company's 155,000 employees working in other countries. That global reach has served the company 
well and has positioned it to take advantage of a high-rise building boom in parts of Asia and Europe. 
Otis, which opened its doors 150 years ago in Yonkers, New York, wasn't the first elevator maker. But it was the 
first to win broad public confidence. Founder Elisha Otis brought his company to prominence with a landmark 
invention: a special braking system that would prevent the cab from crashing to the bottom of the shaft if its cable 
broke. He demonstrated the system by climbing aboard an elevator and severing the cable. 
As public confidence grew, so did the height of buildings. Otis landed numerous big contracts in the early days of 
skyscrapers and established itself as the brand name of choice for big projects. The company installed the first 
elevators in Gustav Eiffel's tower in the late 1880s; the cabs were driven by operators who sat on open-air 
platforms. (Mannequins in period costume now fill the operator's seat in the otherwise modern cars.) Otis also 
introduced the first escalator in 1900 at the Paris Exhibition. 
Today, millions of people daily climb aboard the 1.5 million Otis elevators and 100,000 escalators in use 
world-wide. The company, which gobbles up dozens of small competitors and service companies each year, 
commands 27% of the world-wide new-elevator market. Its biggest competitor, Switzerland's Schindler Group, 
has less than half that share. 
What keeps Otis running smoothly despite ups and downs in the economy is its repair and upgrade business. In a 
slump, people may not build new buildings, but owners of existing buildings still must maintain their elevators. In 
fact, many building owners renovate their elevators during down times to stay competitive with newer properties. 
There are thousands of companies that do such work, from Schindler to mom-and-pop operations with one or two 
service technicians, many of which offer lower prices than Otis. Otis commands an overwhelming share of the 
long-term-service business largely because of its name recognition. In many cases, building owners don't even 
know who built their elevators, so they call Otis. As a result, Otis services not only most of its own elevators but a 
growing chunk of its competitors' as well. 
Another edge comes from new technology. Last year, UTC as a whole spent $2.5 billion on research, or slightly 
more than it made in net profit. It doesn't break out the numbers by business unit for competitive reasons. 
Otis's cabs are equipped with generators that pump electricity back into the building's power grid each time an 
elevator descends, making the cost of operating them negligible. They have computers that automatically detect 
potential problems, then page a technician before a breakdown occurs. Many buildings also subscribe to Otis 
Line, a 24-hour monitoring service that connects the emergency phones aboard elevators to multilingual 
operators in Connecticut. Operators must pick up within two rings and be able to immediately dispatch help. 
Otis often maintains a profitable relationship with customers for decades. Since the Waldorf-Astoria's elevators 
were installed in the 1930s, Otis technicians have been on call 24 hours a day. In some skyscrapers, Otis 
maintenance men have spent their careers servicing just those buildings. 
Many of Otis's recent innovations are designed to improve efficiency as businesses try to squeeze more 
employees into existing office space. "You can't exactly install new elevator shafts, so the elevator manufacturer 
has to come up with ways to make the existing elevators do more," says Bo Hish, Otis's general manager for new 
construction in Manhattan. 
In a 2001 advertising campaign, the company showed an elephant suspended above a mouse by a thin rubber 
belt with embedded steel cables. The caption: "The cable weighs less than the mouse." In most high-rises, the 
wheel on which the elevator cable travels is the size of a backyard grill. With the more-flexible belt, that wheel can 
be as small as 10 centimeters in diameter, making it possible for engineers to reduce the size of every component 
that drives the elevators -- and to eliminate the massive machine rooms that currently eat up valuable space on 
the upper floors of skyscrapers. 
Some elevators are programmed to run on varying schedules depending on the time of day. In the early morning 
hours, for example, most elevators wait at the ground floor, to handle the incoming crowds. Later on, perhaps half 
the elevators wait at the bottom while the rest stay near the top to handle employees' short trips between floors. 
New switches and electrical circuits now speed up the operation of the elevator by 35% just by making it start 
moving more quickly after the doors close. For older elevators, Otis sells newly designed roller guides and metal 
fairings that make the cabs more aerodynamic as they slide through the shaft. Much of the side-to-side movement 
in older models is the result of air trying to find its way around the moving cab.

In a skinny, windowless 117-meter tower outside Bristol, Connecticut, Otis engineers subject new models to 
electrical sabotage, simulated earthquakes, fires, flooding and bone-crushing drops. Recently, engineers bolted 
an elevator cab to a vibrating platform that was doing its best to shake the ceiling panels out. In a giant freezer 
nearby, the doors of an ice-coated elevator were repetitively opening and closing in Arctic temperatures. 
Some of the technologies pioneered in Otis's labs have allowed architects to change the way they design 
buildings. Consider the 54-story Roppongi Hills office tower in Tokyo, featuring double-deck elevators developed 
by Otis and Asian construction giant Mori Building. Before the invention of this elevator, architects who chose to 
use double-deck systems were forced by the rigid design of the two-cab elevator to make their floors the same 
height throughout the building. The Roppongi Hills elevators solve this problem with an adjustable scissorlike 
apparatus between the decks that raises or lowers the bottom deck as needed to adjust for floor height. 
For Otis, the Roppongi tower -- one of the tallest and most prestigious projects undertaken in earthquake-prone 
Tokyo in 30 years -- is a major comeback in Japan. Otis had lost sales there in recent years because it couldn't 
meet Japanese demands for ride quality. Unlike passengers in the U.S. and Europe -- who are willing to accept a 
slight jostling in return for a faster ride -- Japanese riders don't want to feel the elevator move at all. The standard 
was hard to achieve, requiring perfectly straight elevator tracks and a ride-control system that damps even the 
slightest motion. 
UTC is trying to position itself to take advantage of a vertical-construction boom it anticipates in Asia as 600 
million people move from farms to cities in the next 20 years. The company recently scored a coup when it landed 
a contract to install 111 elevators and escalators in a massive new shopping mall being built in Guangzhou, 
China. When completed, the mall is expected to be the largest in the world, with an estimated 800,000 people 
flowing through its doors daily. 
UTC faces big challenges in other parts of its business, particularly if Mr. David is to continue keeping his promise 
of 15% increases in annual profit. In October 2000, a proposed $40 billion acquisition of Honeywell International 
Inc. fell through. Since then, the company hasn't come up with a comparable large acquisition that can deliver the 
kind of growth investors expect. 
Instead, the company reached an agreement to buy Chubb PLC, a British electronic-security company, for 
slightly more than $1 billion. The London-based firm, which isn't related to Chubb Corp. of the U.S., provides fire 
and security services for commercial and residential customers, including 24-hour monitoring and card-access 
systems. If the deal goes through, Chubb would be another building service that UTC could offer in addition to 
elevators and air conditioners. 
At the same time, the aviation market is still uncertain, and UTC's longtime flagship, Pratt & Whitney, has 
struggled to keep market share. Mr. David says he is confident that aerospace will come back, and when it does 
he vows the company will be positioned to take advantage of it. In the long run, he says, the less UTC relies on 
any one segment of its business, the better it will be able to weather economic storms. 
But Mr. David remains an elevator salesman at heart. Behind his desk in Hartford is a painting depicting 
downtown Dallas, but three skyscrapers have been edited out. Why? They were equipped with a competitor's 
elevators. "I didn't want to look at those buildings every day, so we just left them out," he says.

UNITED Technologies Corporation (UTC), the US industrial giant behind the takeover approach to Chubb, finally 
revealed its hand last week, tabling an agreed $1bn (£610m, E860m) bid for the British security firm. For the US 
company, the deal marks the first foray into the fire and securities business, as well as the end of a search for a 
big acquisition since its failed courtship of Honeywell International in 2000. UTC has a relatively low profile in 
Europe, but the US corporate is an industrial conglomerate that has been around for 150 years and its industrial 
products are brand names on both sides of the Atlantic. Ranked number 44 in the Fortune 500 list of the world's 
biggest companies, UTC is the rather anonymous name behind some iconic American businesses: it makes 
everything from Otis lifts to Pratt & Whitney aero engines and Sikorsky Black Hawk helicopters. 
Over the years the company, led by chief executive George David, has combined an ability to meet its financial 
targets with a strong track record on acquisitions, spending around £1.6bn a year on companies. 
Its experience with Honeywell, however, had made it wary of doing large deals: talks between the two companies 
broke down after General Electric launched its own bid for Honeywell, only to see the deal eventually blocked by 
the European regulators. Its most recent acquisitions in the UK were two small aerospace manufacturers, 
Claverham Group and HS Marston. 
Last week's deal will undoubtedly not be the last for UTC in the security business. On Thursday, Steve Page, 
UTC's chief financial officer, signalled that there would be more to come, noting that the Chubb purchase is a 
$2.5bn platform and that if this is all the company had intended to do it would never have started. 
For Chubb the deal, if approved by shareholders, marks the end of a short-lived independence. The firm has 
been struggling to make a profit since it split from Williams Holdings in 2002. 
Overburdened by costs, Chubb's demerger coincided with a slowdown in demand in Australia as the government 
and corporates scaled back spending. 
Attempts by chief executive Jonathan Findler, who was appointed in February, to cut costs and reorganise 
operations have been undermined by the surprise profits warning in April. 
One potential sticking point remains, however: price. Investors in Chubb have been less than impressed with the 
75p a share offer, with several arguing that a range of between 80p to 90p would have been more appropriate. 
However, any possibility of UTC raising its bid disappeared after Chubb's profits warning in April. 
At first glance the offer - a 13% premium to Chubb's closing price the day before the company disclosed the start 
of talks, plus a 1p-a-share special interim dividend - does look little more than a raid on the UK company's coffers. 
However, company observers note that it was always doubtful whether Findler's plans - many of them sensible - 
would have generated a turnaround for Chubb in the longer term. Without the bid, Chubb's shares would surely 
have started their slide back to the low of 493/4p they reached in March. 
Notwithstanding its current problems, Chubb still has a fine array of products and services. With decent 
management from UTC, it could prove a good acquisition for the American giant.

Security services group Chubb yesterday approved a £600m takeover bid from the US firm United Technologies 
Corporation (UTC). 
Executives at UTC were uncertain about the future of Chubb's substantial security guard businesss, which has 
27,000 staff. 
Chairman George David Page said he wanted to make changes, but did not say what they were. 
But Chubb, the world's third-largest security services firm, said it did not see jobs being lost as a result of the 
takeover. 
It would push its turnover to more than £1.5bn and take its workforce to more than 48,000. 
The deal would put UTC among the market leaders in businesses such as electronic hotel locks, security guards 
and burglar alarms, and reduce the conglomerate's dependence on the troubled air travel sector. 
Chubb chief executive Jonathan Findler said he doubted there would be job losses and said the status of its top 
management had not been discussed. 
He declined to comment on the possibility of a bigger rival offer being made for the company. Sweden's Securitas 
abandoned takeover discussions last year, after Chubb's share price rose sharply. 
In April, Chubb warned that its full-year profits would fall below target due to the economic impact of Sars in Asia 
and a fall in spending in the US hotel sector. 
Chubb's board has recommended that shareholders accept the offer, equivalent to 75 pence per share, 
describing it as "fair and reasonable." 
Under the terms of the deal, UTC, which makes Otis lifts and Black Hawk helicopters, will also assume Chubb's 
debt burden, which stood at $934m in April. 
"Chubb fits directly into UTC's business mix and acquisitions strategy," said George David, chairman and chief 
executive of UTC. 
"The company is a market leader in commercial security services and fire protection, and these businesses have 
substantial markets." 
Speculation about Chubb's future has persisted since takeover talks with security firm Securitas broke down last 
year. 
It announced in April this year that it had been approached by UTC about a possible takeover bid. 
But a week after the announcement, Chubb issued a profit warning, blaming Sars for a decline in Asian business. 
Announcing the deal with UTC, Chubb's chairman, Sir Robert Hornton, said: "We believe that there is 
considerable long-term potential in the Chubb Group and we have a clear strategy to deliver it. 
"However, this potential is likely to be realised more quickly within a major global group like UTC, with substantial 
resources."

SECURITY group Chubb finally agreed to a £622million takeover by US industrial giant United Technologies 
yesterday, after weeks of haggling over the price. 
United's offer was made eight weeks ago but a profits warning from Chubb soon after led to a protracted debate 
over its value. A 75p-a-share cash bid has been agreed but at least one leading investor, Templeton, believes it 
undervalues the business. 
Chubb chairman Sir Robert Horton said the deal offered shareholders "the certainty of cash now in uncertain and 
difficult markets". He claimed the potential of the business could be unlocked more quickly as part of a major 
company with substantial funds. United, which is also taking on Chubb's debts (£566million by the end of April), 
makes Pratt &Whitney aircraft engines and Sikorsky helicopters as well as owning Otis elevators. 
United chairman George David highlighted the potential for synergies between Chubb and its Otis and Carrier 
air conditioner business. 
"Chubb fits directly into our business mix and acquisitions strategy, " he said. 
"The company is a market leader in commercial security services and fire protection and these businesses have 
substantial markets." 
Shares in Chubb, which last year was stalked by Swedish rival Securitas, rose 2 bp to 75p.

of 2002. 
United said the acquisition will add security, fire protection to its commercial building offerings. "Chubb fits directly 
into UTC's business mix and acquisitions strategy," said George David, chairman and chief executive. Chubb, 
based in London, employs approximately 48,000 people worldwide and reported revenue of USD2.5bn last year.

- The 
Chubb Directors, who have been so advised by Rothschild, consider

BOSTON, June 12 (Reuters) - Executives at United Technologies Corp. on Thursday expressed uncertainty over 
the future of Chubb Plc's substantial security-guard business a day after the U.S. conglomerate bid $1 billion for 
the London-based company. 
"We've made no decision on the man-guarding business," United Tech Chief Financial Officer Steve Page said on 
a conference call. 
With some 27,000 security personnel that guard buildings and cash in transit, Chubb's guard business accounts 
for about 30 percent of the British-based company's more than $2 billion in total annual revenue, United Tech 
executives told analysts and investors. 
Once Chubb comes under United Tech's umbrella and a permanent management team is named, a 
recommendation on what to do with the security guard business will be made to United Tech Chairman George 
David, Page said. 
Page emphasized no decision about Chubb has been made, but he promised changes in the future if the deal 
closes. 
"We don't intend to buy this business and leave it as is," Page said, speaking about Chubb's entire operations. 
United Technologies said it expects only a slight benefit to earnings this year from its proposed acquisition of 
Chubb, which provides electronic security such as alarm monitoring and closed-circuit television. 
United Tech executives said on a conference call that they expect the deal would close late in the third quarter. 
United Tech is offering $1 billion for Chubb, plus the assumption of about $934 million in debt. The deal was 
announced Wednesday evening.

NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - U.S. conglomerate United Technologies Corp. on Wednesday bid $1.0 billion to 
buy British-based security group Chubb Plc, an acquisition that would give it a new business and reduce its 
exposure to the beleaguered commercial aerospace industry. 
The board of directors of Chubb, one of the world's largest security services companies, recommended that 
shareholders accept the offer, which amounts to 75 pence ($1.25) per share, according to a United Technologies 
release. 
United Technologies, which makes Otis elevators and Black Hawk helicopters, would also assume Chubb's debt, 
which totaled $934 million as of April. 
"Chubb fits directly into UTC's business mix and acquisitions strategy," said George David, United Technologies' 
chairman and chief executive officer. 
Hartford, Connecticut-based United Technologies enters the security industry as a novice, but in Chubb it gets a 
market leader in Hong Kong, Australia and Europe. Chubb has only a small presence in the United States, where 
the Chubb name is mostly associated with an unrelated insurance company called Chubb Corp. 
Chubb's businesses include electronic hotel locks, security guards and burglar alarms. 
The offer price of 75 pence per share represents a premium to Chubb's market price. Chubb shares rose 5 
percent to 72-3/4 pence on Wednesday, valuing the group at around 600 million pounds ($998 million). The stock 
is off about 17 percent this year. 
The offer price is 13 percent higher than Chubb's closing price of 66.25 pence on April 15, the day before the 
company disclosed the start of talks. 
A week after revealing a bid approach in April, the 200-year-old company said full-year profits would be well 
below its forecast, blaming the impact of the deadly SARS virus in Asia and a steep drop in U.S. spending on 
hotel refurbishment. 
Chubb investors have endured a rocky ride since the company's de-merger from the Williams conglomerate in 
2000. Last year, rival security firm Securitas AB of Sweden held bid talks only to pull out when a steep rise in 
Chubb's shares increased the price tag. 
United Technologies said the acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings. The company reaffirmed its 
2003 earnings outlook of $4.55 to $4.80 per share. 
United Technologies' offer requires the acceptance of Chubb shareholders that represent at least 90 percent of 
the outstanding shares. The two companies expect the transaction to close by the third quarter of this year, 
United Technologies said. (Additional reporting by Victoria Cutler and Janet McBride in London and Jake 
Keaveny in New York).

HARTFORD -- United Technologies Corp. (UTX) said late Wednesday it agreed to buy Chubb PLC, a 
London-based electronic-security company, for $1 billion in cash and the assumption of $934 million in net debt. 
United Technologies will pay 75 pence ($1.25) for each share of Chubb - a 3.1% premium to the 72.75 pence 
closing price Wednesday of Chubb's shares on the London Stock Exchange. 
The announcement confirmed a report in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal. 
United Technologies and Chubb have been in talks since April. The deal is expected to be completed in the third 
quarter, contingent upon the approval of the holders of at least 90% of Chubb's shares. 
The transaction will expand United Technologies' commercial businesses, which include Otis elevators and 
escalators, and Carrier heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems. These operations accounted for 57% of 
United Technologies' revenue in 2002. 
The deal will be subject to regulatory approval in the U.S. and the U.K. United Technologies spokesman Paul 
Jackson declined to comment on whether the company had any antitrust concerns. 
United Technologies said the acquisition of Chubb should increase its earnings, but since the deal isn't expected 
to close until the third quarter, United Technologies is maintaining its 2003 earnings guidance of $4.55 to $4.80 a 
share. 
Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call, on average, expect United Technologies to earn $4.64 a 
share for the year. 
"We see lots of potential for synergies among Otis, Carrier and Chubb," said George David, chairman and chief 
executive of United Technologies, in a written statement. United Technologies' companies also include Pratt & 
Whitney, Hamilton Sundstrand, Sikorsky and UTC Power. 
United Technologies also predicts that its 2003 cash flow from operations, before pension contributions and after 
capital expenditures, will be about equal to its net income. The company expects its debt-to-total-capital ratio at 
the end of 2003 to be about the same as it was in 2002. 
United Technologies will assume all of Chubb PLC's net debt, which was $934 million as of April 30, up from 
$779 million at Dec. 31. Chubb will pay a special interim dividend of one pence per share. 
Chubb has about 48,000 employees and reported 2002 revenue of $2.5 billion. United Technologies, which is 
part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, had revenue of $28.2 billion in 2002. 
"We believe that there is considerable long-term potential in the Chubb Group and we have a clear strategy to 
deliver it," Chubb PLC Chairman Robert Horton said in a prepared statement. "However, this potential is likely to 
be realized more quickly within a major global group like UTC with substantial resources. UTC's offer provides 
shareholders with the certainty of cash now in uncertain and difficult markets." 
UBS Investment Bank and JPMorgan acted as financial advisers and Linklaters provided legal advice to United 
Technologies for this transaction. 
In 4 p.m. EDT trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, United Technologies shares were at 
$72.75, up $2.05, or 2.9%, on volume of 1.95 million shares. This follows a 2.1% gain for the stock on Tuesday.

United Technologies Corp. Agrees to Acquire Chubb plc in $1.0 Billion Deal That Will Add Security, Fire 
Protection to UTC's Commercial Building Offerings. 
PRNewswire-FirstCall HARTFORD, Conn. June 11 
HARTFORD, Conn., June 11 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - United Technologies Corp. today announced a $1.0 billion 
offer to purchase Chubb plc, a leading provider of electronic security and fire protection products and services, in 
an all-cash deal that the boards of directors of both companies have approved unanimously. 
Chubb, based in London, employs approximately 48,000 people and reported 2002 revenue of $2.5 billion (1.5 
billion U.K. pounds), with more than 1 million customers worldwide and market-leading positions in the U.K., 
France, Hong Kong, Canada, and Australia. The transaction will expand UTC's commercial businesses, which 
include Otis elevators and escalators and Carrier heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and 
account for 57 percent of UTC's 2002 revenues. 
The offer price of 75 pence per share represents a premium of 13 percent to Chubb's closing price of 66.25 
pence per share on April 15, the day before Chubb disclosed the start of talks. UTC also will assume Chubb's 
net debt, which was $934 million (566 million U.K. pounds unaudited) as of April 30, 2003, up from $779 million 
(473 million U.K. pounds) as of December 31, 2002. Chubb will pay a special interim dividend of 1 pence per 
share. 
UTC said the transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings, and the company reaffirmed its 2003 outlook for 
earnings per share in the range of $4.55 to $4.80 and for cash flow from operations, before pension contributions 
and after capital expenditures, approximately equal to net income. UTC's debt to total capital ratio is expected to 
end the year at approximately the same level as 2002. 
"Chubb fits directly into UTC's business mix and acquisitions strategy," said George David, UTC's Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer. "The company is a market leader in commercial security services and fire protection, and 
these businesses have substantial markets. Chubb is further positioned well internationally, and UTC's already 
high aftermarket and international revenues will increase following the acquisition." 
"Most of all," David said, "we like the overlaps in our customer populations. UTC already sells to exceptionally 
high numbers of buildings in the world, and Chubb's installations will both overlap with and augment this large 
presence. We see lots of potential for synergies among Otis, Carrier and Chubb. We like this deal a lot." 
Commenting on the offer, Sir Robert Horton, Chairman of Chubb, said, "Chubb has a fine portfolio of 
businesses, a strong brand name, and talented and committed people. We believe that there is considerable 
long-term potential in the Chubb Group and we have a clear strategy to deliver it. However, this potential is likely 
to be realized more quickly within a major global group like UTC with substantial resources. UTC's offer provides 
shareholders with the certainty of cash now in uncertain and difficult markets." 
UTC's offer is subject to customary conditions including acceptance of the offer by Chubb shareholders owning at 
least 90 percent of the shares outstanding, approvals by all relevant regulatory agencies, and compliance with 
required filing and other regulations. The companies expect the transaction to close in the third quarter. 
UBS Investment Bank and JPMorgan acted as financial advisers to UTC, and Linklaters acted as its legal adviser. 
United Technologies Corp., based in Hartford, Conn., is a diversified company that provides high-technology 
products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. In addition to Otis and Carrier,

HARTFORD -(Dow Jones)- United Technologies Corp. (UTX) agreed to buy Chubb PLC (U.CHU), a 
London-based electronic-security company, for $1 billion in cash and the assumption of $934 million in net debt. 
United Technologies will pay 75 pence for each share of Chubb PLC - a 3.1% premium to the 72.75 pence 
closing price Wednesday of Chubb PLC's shares on the London Stock Exchange. This confirms a story in 
Wednesday's edition of The Wall Street Journal, which reported that United Technologies would pay about 75 
pence ($1.23) a share. 
United Technologies and Chubb PLC have been in talks since April. The deal is expected to be completed in the 
third quarter, contingent upon the approval of the holders of at least 90% of Chubb PLC's shares. 
The transaction will expand United Technologies' commercial businesses, which include Otis elevators and 
escalators, and Carrier heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems. These operations accounted for 57% of 
United Technologies' revenue in 2002. 
The deal will be subject to regulatory approval in the U.S. and the U.K. United Technologies spokesman Paul 
Jackson declined to comment on whether the company had any antitrust concerns. 
United Technologies said the acquisition of Chubb PLC should increase its earnings, but since the deal isn't 
expected to close until the third quarter, United Technologies is maintaining its 2003 earnings guidance of $4.55 
to $4.80 a share. 
Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call, on average, expect United Technologies to earn $4.64 a 
share for the year. 
"We see lots of potential for synergies among Otis, Carrier and Chubb," said George David, chairman and chief 
executive of United Technologies, in a written statement. United Technologies' companies also include Pratt & 
Whitney, Hamilton Sundstrand, Sikorsky and UTC Power. 
United Technologies also predicts that its 2003 cash flow from operations, before pension contributions and after 
capital expenditures, will be about equal to its net income. The company expects its debt-to-total-capital ratio at 
the end of 2003 to be about the same as it was in 2002. 
United Technologies will assume all of Chubb PLC's net debt, which was $934 million as of April 30, up from 
$779 million at Dec. 31. Chubb PLC will pay a special interim dividend of 1 pence per share. 
Chubb has about 48,000 employees and reported 2002 revenue of $2.5 billion. United Technologies, which is 
part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, had revenue of $28.2 billion in 2002. 
"We believe that there is considerable long-term potential in the Chubb Group and we have a clear strategy to 
deliver it," Chubb PLC Chairman Robert Horton said in a press release. "However, this potential is likely to be 
realized more quickly within a major global group like UTC with substantial resources. UTC's offer provides 
shareholders with the certainty of cash now in uncertain and difficult markets." 
UBS Investment Bank and JPMorgan acted as financial advisers and Linklaters provided legal advice to United 
Technologies for this transaction.

United Technologies shares closed Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $72.75, up $2.05 or 2.9%, 
on volume of 1.95 million shares. This follows a 2.1% gain for the stock on Tuesday.

LONDON -- Chubb PLC's board was meeting Tuesday to consider United Technologies Corp.'s offer to buy the 
electronic-security company for more than $1 billion, people familiar with the situation said. 
While the two sides haven't reached an accord and there isn't a definitive agreement on price, United 
Technologies was negotiating Monday to buy Chubb for about 75 pence ($1.23) a share, people familiar with the 
situation said. 
By moving to buy Chubb, United Technologies is making a gambit that in the short term Chubb's 
electronic-security business will help counter the drag on United Technologies' aviation businesses, a result of the 
airline industry's deep slump. Longer term, though, United Technologies is hoping to garner a steady stream of 
revenue from service contracts that securities companies such as Chubb thrive on. 
Early afternoon on the London Stock Exchange, Chubb's stock rose 3.3%, or two pence, to 70 pence. In early 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, United Technologies shares gained 2.4%, or $1.66, to $70.90, as 
investors started snapping up the shares on the expectation a deal was imminent. 
Spokesmen for United Technologies, of Hartford, Connecticut, and Chubb declined to comment. 
United Technologies Chairman and Chief Executive George David has set a goal of boosting revenue 15% and 
acknowledged that in order to meet that goal over the long term, the company is going to have to achieve a 
substantial part of that through acquisition. 
United Technologies started diversifying its portfolio of businesses in the mid-1970s with the acquisition of assets 
such as Otis Elevator Co. and later Carrier air conditioning. It also owns Pratt & Whitney jet engines, Sikorsky 
helicopters, aerospace-parts maker Hamilton Sundstrand and a growing hydrogen-fuel-cell unit. Last year, the 
155,000-employee company reported in $28 billion in revenue. 
Chubb, founded in 1818 by Charles Chubb, has been publicly traded since November 2000 after it was spun off 
from U.K. conglomerate Williams PLC, which owned it for three years. The London company, which isn't related 
to Chubb Corp. of the U.S., provides a full range of fire and security services for commercial and home 
customers, including 24-hour monitoring, card-access systems and closed-circuit systems. 
Chubb, which employs 48,000 people world-wide, generates most of its business in the Asian-Pacific region, 
primarily Australia and Hong Kong, and through a unit covering the U.K., Ireland and South Africa. In continental 
Europe, about two-thirds of revenue is generated in France. Its smallest unit is in the Americas.

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - United Technologies Corp. late Wednesday announced its $1 billion purchase of 
Chubb PLC, a London-based provider of electronic security and fire protection products and services. 
The cash deal was approved unanimously by the boards of both companies, UTC said. 
Chubb has about 48,000 workers and reported revenue of $2.5 billion last year. 
UTC said the transaction will expand its commercial businesses, which include Otis elevators and Carrier heating, 
ventilation and air conditioning systems. 
UTC will assume Chubb's debt, which was $934 million as of April 30, up from $779 million as of December 31, 
2002. 
"Chubb fits directly into UTC's business mix and acquisitions strategy," said George David, chairman and chief 
executive of United Technologies. "The company is a market leader in commercial security services and fire 
protection, and these businesses have substantial markets." 
Chubb chairman Robert Horton said the financial benefits for shareholders were clear. 
"UTC's offer provides shareholders with the certainty of cash now in uncertain and difficult markets," he said. 
United Technologies also reaffirmed its 2003 outlook of $4.55 to $4.80 for per-share earnings. 
UTC's offer must be approved by regulatory agencies and Chubb shareholders who own at least 90 percent of 
shares. The companies expect the transaction to close in the third quarter. 
United Technologies stock rose $2.05, or about 3 percent, to close at $72.75 per share Wednesday on the New 
York Stock Exchange.

THE SKEPTIC: Crunch Time For UTC? 
THE SKEPTIC: Crunch Time For UTC?

Dow Jones International News

A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN 
LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Could a deal between United Technologies (UTX) and U.K. electronics security 
company Chubb (U.CHU) be about to emerge at last? 
If UTC Chairman and CEO George David has his way, and manages to persuade Chubb CEO Jonathan Findler 
of the merits of a deal, we could see an agreed deal at a decent price very soon. 
UTC certainly needs a deal or two, and adding in a security equipment arm could create a perfect sixth division 
for the big U.S. industrial and electrical equipment group. 
UTC set aside $1.5 billion in each of the last two years for acquisitions, but apart from a couple of smallish 
aerospace concerns costing $400 million or so the company has managed little in M&A arena since its bid for 
Honeywell (HON) was trumped by General Electric (GE) more than two years ago. 
Meanwhile, UTC has just reaffirmed FY2003 earnings guidance of $4.55-$4.80 a share, and said it still expects 
operating cashflow to equal net income. 
Satisfying analyst concerns on earnings and continuing strong cash flows is the least of UTC's problems, though. 
What's of more concern is the continuing deterioration of the global airline industry, devastated since the terror 
attacks of September 11 and made even worse this year with the Iraq war and the outbreak of SARS. 
With around 23% of group sales from commercial aerospace and 20% from military, UTC is highly exposed to the 
worst-ever downturn in the airline sector. The situation is made all the worse by having one customer - United 
Airlines (UAL) - accounting for around 18% of enginemaker Pratt & Whitney's commercial industry sales. 
United Airlines was forced into a Chapter 11 filing at the end of 2002, having announced losses exceeding $4 
billion over the past two years. It isn't the only one, and there may be more airlines headed in the same direction. 
While United Airlines still has high hopes of exiting Chapter 11, perhaps as early as the first quarter next year, the 
omens for the world's second-largest airline can't look that good as long as world air passenger traffic continues 
to plunge. 
For UTC, the problem isn't just about new engine orders drying up. It's also that lucrative orders for spares have 
declined as airlines slash capacity, cut flights and put more aircraft with engines built during the era when Pratt & 
Whitney enjoyed a much larger share of the market into storage. 
Fortunately, Pratt & Whitney isn't all about commercial engines, with a big position in the military engine segment. 
With defense spending rising, particularly in the U.S., the company should be in a position to look forward to 
enough new military business to offset the commercial engine industry downturn. 
UTC has Sikorsky Helicopters and big defense business within Hamilton Sundstrand as well, and is well-known 
for its Otis elevators and large-scale activities in all types of refrigeration with Carrier. 
Like many big industrial concerns, UTC is reacting to change by moving what production it can to low cost 
countries. But while UTC continues to push for a lower cost base, it isn't growing the business - hence the need 
for acquisitions.

Page 69 of 81 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
If UTC manages to pull off the Chubb buy this should go down pretty well with the investment community, though 
some might feel UTC is still being somewhat cautious with its acquisition strategy in terms of size and risk. But it 
would at least prove UTC isn't standing still, and that it does have a forward strategy to take the business in new 
directions and provide new forms of growth. 
There aren't too many other options available, and it's not as if UTC has a shortage of balance sheet power to 
actually undertake some M&A right now. Whether it has the will, though, remains to be seen. 
By the same token, providing some idea of what it intends to do about its shrinking share of the commercial 
aero-engine market would also go down well. 
Of course, ruling out a link with GE on regulatory grounds, if UTC were to bite the bullet on commercial aero 
engines it would likely need to involve Rolls Royce - and it's far from clear that either company want to extend 
existing relationships any further.

AMERICAN industrial giant United Technologies Corporation (UTC) is close to clinching a £580m deal to buy 
Chubb, the security-services company. 
City sources say that an offer to shareholders could come as early as the end of this week, and that it is almost 
certain to carry a recommendation to accept from the Chubb board. 
Neither company would comment last night. The progress of the talks has been closely guarded since The 
Sunday Times revealed last month that UTC was the mystery bidder stalking the security-services company. 
Rumours swept Wall Street on Friday that UTC was on the point of abandoning the negotiations, having been 
unable to agree a price. But sources in London said that the American company had not given up, and was close 
to convincing Chubb's board, led by Sir Robert Horton, the chairman, to recommend an offer at about 70p a 
share. 
Horton is understood to have struck up a rapport with George David, chairman and chief executive of UTC. 
Chubb's shares closed on Friday at 64Ap, valuing the company at £535m. 
The offer will be galling for Chubb shareholders, who saw the share price go as high as 213p last year after 
Securitas, a rival security group, opened takeover talks only to be scared off by the rapidly rising share price. 
It will also be a blow for Chubb's management, led by chief executive, Jonathan Findler, which has presided over 
two profit warnings this year, one of which came after the company disclosed that it was in talks with a unnamed 
bidder. 
But analysts believe that UTC's bid is likely to succeed, given that no other serious interest for Chubb has 
emerged during the month-long talks. 
UTC is also unlikely to go beyond 70p a share, and would risk the opprobrium of Wall Street if it did so. 
One institutional shareholder in UTC, who asked not to be named, said: "If they paid more than 70p I would be 
really unhappy. Chubb's main business, security monitoring, is taking a real hammering at the moment, and I just 
can't see where the growth is going to come from." 
Although little known in Britain, UTC is one of America's most respected industrial conglomerates. It employs 
155,000 people and produces some of the world's best-known industrial brands, including Pratt & Whitney 
engines, Sikorsky helicopters, Otis lifts and Carrier airconditioners. It is ranked 44 in the Forbes 500 list of the 
world's largest companies. 
It last sprang to prominence in Britain in the 1980s when it played a central role in the Westland affair, a dispute 
over the future of a British helicopter maker that split the Thatcher cabinet.

United Technologies Corp., relying on its nonaviation businesses to counter the airline industry's deep slump, is in 
talks to buy electronic-security company Chubb PLC. 
According to people familiar with the situation, the Hartford, Connecticut, company contacted officials at Chubb 
and expressed an interest in conducting talks. London's Sunday Times said that United Technologies had bid 
GBP 1 billion (1.44 billion euros), but a person familiar with the discussions said that talks between the two 
companies are still in the "very, very early stages," and that a price for the deal hasn't been determined. 
Chubb, founded in 1818 by Charles Chubb, has been publicly traded since November 2000, after it was spun off 
from U.K. conglomerate Williams PLC, which had owned it for three years. The London-based company, which 
isn't related to Chubb Corp. of the U.S., provides a full range of fire and security services for commercial and 
home customers, including 24-hour monitoring, card-access systems and closed-circuit television systems. 
United Technologies Chairman and Chief Executive George David has made no secret of his intention to expand 
the company through acquisitions, particularly if they complement the company's aerospace and 
building-products units. The company owns Pratt & Whitney jet engines, Otis elevators and Carrier air 
conditioning, as well Sikorsky helicopters, aerospace-parts maker Hamilton Sundstrand and a growing 
hydrogen-fuel-cell unit. Last year, the 155,000-employee company brought in $28 billion (25.72 billion euros) in 
revenue. 
If the deal were reached, Chubb likely would become an additional operating unit, people familiar with the 
situation said. Such a diverse portfolio could offer United Technologies a competitive boost. 
Chubb, which employs 48,000 people world-wide, generates most of its business in the Asian-Pacific region, 
primarily Australia and Hong Kong, and through a unit covering the U.K., Ireland and South Africa. In continental 
Europe, about two-thirds of its revenue is generated in France. Its smallest unit is in the Americas.

United Technologies Corporation (UTC), the American industrial group, is this week expected to seek an agreed 
takeover of Chubb, the British security services company. 
George David, chairman and chief executive of UTC, will press for talks with the Chubb board, led by Sir Robert 
Horton. Last week Chubb disclosed it had received a takeover approach, but only now has UTC been revealed 
as the suitor. 
Chubb's shares soared by nearly 30 per cent on the day of the announcement, before falling back slightly to end 
the week at 82p. 
News that UTC is behind the takeover offer is likely to surprise analysts, who were expecting the bid to have 
come from a rival security business. 
UTC is one of America's most respected industrial companies, with businesses including Pratt & Whitney jet 
engines, Sikorsky helicopters and Otis lifts. 
Chubb has been the subject of takeover speculation since negotiations with the security giant Securitas broke 
down last year. Analysts expect any offer would have to value the company at between £800 million and £1 billion 
in order to be successful. 
Chubb - whose services include fire detection, CCTV, alarm monitoring and security personnel - was demerged 
from the former conglomerate Williams Holdings in 2000. 
However, the group's shares, which were listed on the stock market at 255p, hit a low of 49p in March as the 
company was dogged by concerns over organic growth. 
In February Chubb reported a rise in pre-tax profits for its continuing businesses to £110.1 million, from £105.3 
million in 2001, and said that group sales of £1.5 billion were 6 per cent higher than the previous year's when 
based on constant exchange rates. 
It is possible that rival bidders may emerge, but UTC's financial firepower may scare away competitors. UTC 
spends on average £1.6 billion a year on acquisitions.

A US industrial giant is the mystery bidder behind last week's takeover approach to famous UK security services 
company Chubb. 
United Technologies Corporation, whose interests include Sikorsky helicopters, contacted senior Chubb 
executives early last week. The Scotsman understands top-level talks involving Chubb chairman Sir Robert 
Horton and George David, his opposite number at UTC, have been taking place throughout the Easter break. 
Last night, senior City sources confirmed UTC was the mystery bidder and predicted further details could become 
public this week if the talks continue to go well over the next few days. 
"The bidder is definitely UTC, which has been a real surprise," said one well-placed industry observer. "Everyone 
presumed it was going to be a rival security company." 
However, a spokesman for Chubb refused to comment. Chubb, which has been making security products since 
the 1800s, sparked excitement last Wednesday after officially admitting it had received a takeover approach from 
an unnamed bidder. 
But unusual share price movements before the announcement are under scrutiny by the London Stock Exchange 
and the Financial Services Authority. Investigators are also understood to be examining high trading in shares of 
Somerfield and Amey ahead of bid announcements last week. 
Although Chubb's share price of 81.75p values it at under #700 million, analysts believe any formal approach 
would need to be in the region of #800 million to #1 billion to stand any chance of success. 
Although not a household name, UTC is one of the most admired industrial firms in the world and boasts a 
turnover of around #18 billion. 
As well as Sikorsky helicopters, its portfolio includes Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines and Otis lifts. Based in 
Hartford, Connecticut, it could not be reached for comment last night.

US industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation is the firm behind the 
bid for security services group Chubb, according to newspaper reports yesterday. 
Chubb, which is based in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, announced last week that it had received a preliminary 
approach which might lead to a takeover offer. 
The group's shares soared nearly 30% on the day of the announcement, before falling back slightly to end the 
week at 82p. 
The news that UTC is the suitor is likely to surprise analysts, who were expecting the bid to have come from a

Chubb has been the subject of takeover speculation since negotiations with security giant Securitas broke down 
last year, and analysts expect any offer would have to value the company at between (pounds) 800m and 
(pounds) 1bn to be successful. 
Chubb, whose services include fire detection, CCTV, alarm monitoring and security personnel, was demerged 
from former conglomerate Williams in 2000. 
The group's shares, which listed on the stock market for 255p, hit a low of 49.75p in March as the group was

based on constant exchange rates. 
No one from UTC or Chubb was available for comment.

Leading the News: United Technologies Is in Talks to Buy Chubb PLC 
Leading the News: United Technologies Is in Talks to Buy Chubb PLC

United Technologies Corp., which is relying on its nonaviation businesses to counter the airline industry's deep 
slump, is in talks to buy electronic-security company Chubb PLC. 
According to people familiar with the situation, the Hartford, Conn., company contacted officials at Chubb and 
expressed an interest in conducting talks. London's Sunday Times said that United Technologies had bid GBP 1 
billion ($1.57 billion), but a person familiar with the discussions said that talks between the two companies still are 
in the "very, very early stages" and that a price for the deal hasn't been determined. 
Chubb, founded in 1818 by Charles Chubb, has been publicly traded since November 2000, after it was spun off 
from U.K. conglomerate Williams PLC, which had owned it for three years. The London-based company, which is 
unrelated to Chubb of the U.S., provides a full range of fire and security services for commercial and home 
customers, including 24-hour monitoring, card-access systems and closed-circuit television systems. 
United Technologies Chairman and Chief Executive George David has made no secret of his intention to expand 
the company through acquisitions, particularly if they complement the company's aerospace and 
building-products units. The company owns Pratt &Whitney jet engines, Otis elevators and Carrier air 
conditioning, as well Sikorsky helicopters, aerospace-parts maker Hamilton Sundstrand and a growing 
hydrogen-fuel-cell unit. Last year, the 155,000-employee company brought in $28 billion in revenue. 
If the deal were reached, Chubb likely would become an additional operating unit, people familiar with the 
situation said. Such a diverse portfolio could offer United Technologies a competitive boost, particularly when 
bidding to take part in building construction projects. 
Chubb, which employs 48,000 people world-wide, generates most of its business in the Asia-Pacific region, 
primarily Australia and Hong Kong, and through a unit covering the U.K., Ireland and South Africa. In continental 
Europe, about two-thirds of its revenue is generated in France. Its smallest unit is in the Americas. 
Based on Thursday's stock-market closing price of 82 pence, Chubb was valued at GBP 679.8 million. U.K. 
markets were closed for Good Friday. The company's stock price never has reached the levels of its first day as a 
public company, when the shares traded between GBP 2.50 and GBP 2.65. 
Sales from continuing operations rose 4.4% last year to GBP 1.5 billion, while earnings per share swung to a 
profit of 1.1 pence from a loss of 2.4 pence in 2001. 
United Technologies has been in the hunt for a major acquisition since Mr. David's 2001 bid for Honeywell 
International Inc. was trumped by a last-minute offer from General Electric Co.'s then-chairman, Jack Welch. That 
deal was scuttled several months later after European regulators refused to approve it, in part because of 
concerns raised by United Technologies. 
A United Technologies spokesman said that the company had "no comment on speculation or rumors about 
mergers and acquisitions." A Chubb spokesman wouldn't confirm that United Technologies was the bidder, but 
he said the company stood by a statement it released Wednesday confirming that it had received a "preliminary 
approach" from an unidentified company. Chubb was compelled by British regulators to issue the statement after 
its share price jumped to 76 pence, after trading at 61.25 pence earlier in the week. 
During a conference call Thursday with analysts after United Technologies released its first-quarter earnings, Vice 
Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Steven Page said the company planned to complete about $1.5 billion in 
acquisitions this year. He said that in recent weeks, the company had seen some "encouraging" opportunities and

Page 76 of 81 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
that "valuations are more realistic" on a number of companies. Mr. Page hinted that any acquisitions would be "so 
close" to the company's core business lines that "you will see that it is what we do best." 
This is not the first time Chubb has been a takeover target. It was approached last year by Securitas AB of 
Sweden, but those talks foundered after three days. Chubb's current chief executive, Jonathan Findler, took over 
in February after Robert Gasparini decided to pursue business interests in the U.S. Mr. Findler previously had 
been chief financial officer.

United Technologies revealed as Chubb bidder. 
United Technologies revealed as Chubb bidder.

UNITED TECHNOLOGIES, the maker of Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, emerged yesterday as the mystery 
bidder behind last week's offer for the security group Chubb. 
Chubb, the world's third-largest security group, revealed it had received a preliminary takeover approach on 
Wednesday. The news sent the shares up almost 20 per cent, giving Chubb a market value of £680m at the end 
of last week. 
The identity of Chubb's suitor, an US industrial conglomerate with a relatively low profile in the UK despite the 
fact that it ranks among the world's 50 largest companies, will come as a surprise to the City. But United 
Technologies, although it is best known for its engine maker Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky helicopters, also owns 
Otis elevators and escalators and Carrier heating and air conditioners. 
City sources point out that an acquisition of Chubb, which has sold its eponymous locks and safes business and 
now focuses on electronic security devices and services, would fit neatly alongside United Technologies' building 
businesses. With the airline industry in the doldrums in the wake of 11 September, the war in Iraq and the Sars 
virus crises, the US group has been looking to expand its building side. 
Despite falling sales at Pratt & Whitney, the conglomerate reported a 7 per cent rise in first-quarter net income 
last week to $502m (£318m) as a cost cutting drive by George David, the chief executive, paid off. The company 
already gets more than half its sales from outside America, and has more than 30,000 employees in Europe. 
Shares in Chubb have dived by about 70 per cent over the past year since an agreed deal with Securitas, the 
largest player in the security systems market, unravelled last May. The Swedish group walked away from the deal 
after 18 months of talks when news of the merger sent Chubb shares soaring and Securitas stock plummeting. 
The size of Chubb, and the £750m of debt and pension deficit it bears, left analysts speculating last week that 
only larger rivals or private equity players would be able to afford the £1bn plus price tag any deal would entail. 
Securitas ruled itself out of the bidding this time, as did Group 4 Falck, the number two player, which has also 
been linked with Chubb in the past. Rentokil Initial and the US conglomerate Tyco, which owns the alarms group 
ADT, were mooted possible as contenders in the City. Both groups declined to comment. 
However, a number of analysts predicted the most likely bidder would be a private equity firm looking to take 
advantage of the fact that Chubb's share price has slumped from more than 250p when it demerged from 
Williams at the end of 2000 to less than 50p last month.

UNITED Technologies Corporation, the US industrial giant behind Sikorsky helicopters and Otis lifts, is the 
mystery suitor courting British security group Chubb. 
Chubb directors have scheduled an urgent board meeting after the Easter break to consider UTC's approach, 
believed to value the group at more than £800m. 
Last Wednesday the British security company was forced to admit it had received an approach from an 
unidentified bidder, after unusually heavy trading in its shares. The stock, which hit a low of 49p last month, 
soared to 92p on the news. It is now trading at 81 3/4 p, giving the group a market capitalisation of £680m. 
A Chubb spokesman yesterday declined to discuss the approach, while UTC could not be contacted. However, 
City sources have confirmed the Connecticut-based company, led by chairman and chief executive George 
David, put an acquisition proposal to Chubb's newly-promoted chief executive Jonathan Findler in the last 
fortnight. Chubb is thought to consider the bid both credible and potentially attractive. 
UTC, ranked 44 in the Forbes 500 list of the world's biggest companies with a turnover of $28.2 billion ( £18 
billion), is expected to reveal its hand to the market this week. The company, which also makes Pratt & Whitney 
jet engines and Carrier air conditioning, is said to be mulling a price of around 100p per share, valuing Chubb at 
£829m. Analysts have suggested a successful bid would need to be in the £800m-£1 billion range. 
It is understood that Chubb, usually advised by Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, has engaged a different bank 
to steer it through negotiations. 
UTC employs around 152,000 people and operates in 180 countries. It has two main divisions, aerospace and 
building services. While a purchase of the Chubb fire alarms-to-security operations would herald a new area of 
business for the group, it is nevertheless seen as a complementary fit with the existing climate control and 
elevator operations. 
Last year Chubb held talks with Swedish rival Securitas, the world's largest security company. Securitas pulled 
out because the asking price was too high. 
The FSA is believed to be investigating trading in Chubb's shares ahead of last week's announcement.

THE American industrial giant United Technologies Corporation (UTC) is the mystery bidder behind last week's 
takeover approach for Chubb, Britain's leading security-services company. 
Senior UTC executives, led by chairman and chief executive George David, are understood to have contacted 
Chubb early last week with an invitation to open talks. Chubb disclosed the approach to the market on 
Wednesday, pushing its shares to a three-month high of 92p. 
Little known in Britain, UTC is one of America's most respected industrial conglomerates. It employs 155,000 
people, and produces some of the world's best-known industrial brands, including Pratt & Whitney aero engines, 
Sikorsky helicopters, Otis lifts and Carrier air conditioning. It is ranked No44 in the Forbes500 list of the world's 
largest companies. 
It came to public attention in Britain in 1986 when it emerged as a central player in the Westland affair, the 
dispute over the future of the UK's helicopter industry that split Margaret Thatcher's cabinet. 
Chubb, which was spun off from the former Williams conglomerate in 2000, no longer produces the eponymous 
locks. It now makes electronic security and fire prevention products. Securitas, a rival security company, pulled 
out of bid talks last year after a sharp jump in Chubb's share price. 
The shares have slumped from a 52-week high of 213Ap to close last week at 79p, valuing the company at 
£680m. Analysts forecast last week that to secure an agreed deal, a bidder would have to offer between £800m 
and £1billion. 
Chubb declined to comment on the identity of the bidder last night. A UTC spokesman said the company "never 
commented on market speculation". 
But City sources said UTC was likely to confirm its intentions this week, and that David hoped to secure a 
recommendation to shareholders from the Chubb board, led by chairman Sir Robert Horton and chief executive 
Jonathan Findler. 
One senior banker said UTC would stress the synergies resulting from a takeover. 
"This deal is right in line with UTC's tried-and-trusted strategy of buying businesses complementary to its existing 
divisions," he said. "The firm has two basic business areas, aerospace and buildings. Chubb fits right alongside 
the buildings operations." 
David is understood to have told colleagues that he believes Chubb has potential for growth through expansion 
into new regions, particularly in collaboration with Otis. It is unclear whether a rival bidder will emerge. Suitors 
may be deterred by UTC's financial muscle; it spends £1.6 billion a year on acquisitions. 
o The Financial Services Authority is understood to be investigating heavy trading of Chubb shares before its 
announcement last week.
