SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan 12 (Reuters) - Applied Materials Inc. , the world's largest maker of semiconductor 
manufacturing equipment, on Wednesday said it would buy Etec Systems, Inc. in a stock deal currently valued at 
about $1.8 billion, its largest acquisition to date. 
Etec, based in Hayward, Calif., develops technology to make masks, which are used to print circuitry patterns 
onto silicon wafers, as one of the many steps in the chip making process. 
The companies said that each share of Etec's stock would be exchanged for 0.649 shares of Applied Materials' 
common stock, valuing Etec's shares at about $82.46, a premium of about 65 percent to Etec's closing stock 
price of 49-7/8 on Wednesday. 
Based on Applied's closing stock price of 127-1/16 and on Etec's 21.5 million shares outstanding last November, 
the deal is currently valued at $1.8 billion. The acquisition will be accounted for as a pooling of interests and is 
expected to close, pending the approval of shareholders and U.S. regulators. 
"By combining our expertise in process technology and metrology with the leading supplier of advanced mask 
pattern generation equipment, we have the opportunity to advance mask making technology," said James 
Morgan, Applied Materials chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement. 
Semiconductor equipment analysts said that there have been rumours in the past six months or so that Etec was 
in talks to be acquired either Applied Materials or KLA-Tencor Corp. . 
Etec, which is the dominant company in the mask-making business, makes the single-most expensive piece of 
capital equipment in the chip-making business and its systems sell for about $10-$15 million each. 
"They only ship about six or seven a quarter. If the analysts's model is (for Etec) to ship six, and you ship five, 
you are not going to make your numbers," said Mike O'Brien, a SoundView Technology analyst. "It eliminates the 
volatility of the Etec story," he added. 
Analysts said Applied will gain Etec's technology and experience in laser beam writing and electron beam writing, 
which Applied can use in its metrology business and in a venture with Lucent Technologies Inc. , ASM 
Lithography and others for next-generation lithography. Lithography is technique using UV sensitive masks to 
create patterns on silicon wafers. 
"There is synergy within the product lines and the distribution channels," said Sue Billat, a Robertson Stephens 
analyst. "They (Applied) have a key appreciation of technology roadmaps and what their customer requirements 
are." 
Applied Materials shares closed up 6-1/4 in Nasdaq trade to 127-1/16. Etec Systems closed up 7-5/16 to 49-7/8.

The companies said in a statement that each share of Etec's stock would be exchanged for 0.649 shares of

wafers. 
The companies did not specify the value of the transaction, and officials were not immediately available for 
comment.

Morgan, Applied Materials chairman and chief executive. 
The acquisition would be accounted for under the pooling of interests method, the companies said. The 
completion of the deal requires Etec stockholder and regulatory approvals. 
Applied Materials shares closed up 6-1/4 at 127-1/16 in trading on the Nasdaq. Etec Systems closed up 7-5/16 to 
49-7/8, also on the Nasdaq.
