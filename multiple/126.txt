NEW YORK (AP) - Propelled by solid growth from key medicines such as Lipitor and Viagra, Pfizer Inc. said 
Wednesday its third quarter net income rose 13 percent. Its results before charges narrowly beat Wall Street 
estimates. 
The New York City-based pharmaceutical firm earned $2.35 billion, or 38 cents a share, during the third quarter, 
up from $2.1 billion, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue rose 12 percent to $8.73 billion, up from $7.82 billion a year earlier. 
Earnings before an accounting change and costs related to its pending acquisition of Pharmacia Corp. rose 12 
percent to $2.45 billion or 39 cents a share. That beat analysts' consensus forecast of 38 cents a share, 
according to Thomson First Call's survey. 
"The solid-ongoing revenue growth is important," said Lehman Brothers analyst Trevor Polischuk. "Pfizer could 
slash costs to meet earnings but earnings is coming from solid top line growth." 
Pfizer's stable of blockbuster medicines continued to perform well with overall pharmaceutical revenues rising 13 
percent to $7.45 billion. Revenue from cholesterol lowering agent Lipitor rose 22 percent to $2 billion while sales 
of erectile dysfunction medicine Viagra increased 17 percent to $437 million. Sales from pain medication 
Neurontin advanced 29 percent to $567 million. 
"The strong third-quarter growth or our pharmaceutical business was driven by the breadth and depth of our 
product portfolio as well as the performance of our operations within and across markets around the world," said 
Karen Katen, a corporate executive vice president who is also president of the pharmaceuticals group, in a 
statement. 
Pfizer said the Pharmacia merger is progressing well and should be completed by the end of the year. The 
company says the deal will not dilute earnings next year and should add 6 cents a share to earnings in 2004. 
Pfizer said it expects to earn 47 cents a share in the fourth quarter, a penny shy of analysts' expectations. 
Polischuk wasn't troubled by the shortfall because the company said it anticipated earning $1.58 a share for 2002, 
which is in line with analysts expectations. Earnings are expected to grow 21 percent. 
The drugmaker said it had filed a suit against Mylan Laboratories Inc. last month to stop the generic drug 
manufacturer from marketing a version of Norvacs, a hypertension treatment. 
Brand name drug companies are granted an automatic 30-month stay against generic firms seeking to circumvent 
patents if the pharmaceutical concern files the lawsuit within 45 days of the generic company filing its application 
for approval. Pfizer missed the deadline due to an "administrative error" and said U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration is reviewing whether Pfizer should still get the stay. 
Pfizer chairman and chief executive Henry McKinnell noted there has been a rash of generic companies seeking 
to bring drugs to market before their patents expire and called their actions, "a slight perversion of our legal 
system." 
McKinnell also downplayed the suggestion that its allergy medication Zyrtec might be adversely affected when its 
competitor, Claritin, loses its patent protection later this year and becomes an over-the-counter, and thus cheaper 
drug.

Page 5 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"Zyrtec looks pretty good to me," said McKinnell. 
For the first nine months of the year, Pfizer's net income rose 8 percent to $6.27 billion, or $1.00 a share, from 
$5.83 billion, or 92 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 10 percent to $25.17 billion from $23.02 billion a year 
ago. 
On the New York Stock Exchange, Pfizer shares climbed 12 cents to close Wednesday at $31.91.

STOCKHOLM, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. will keep part of its research and development operations in Sweden 
after the pharmaceuticals group takes over smaller U.S.-Swedish rival Pharmacia Corp, the company's chief 
executive said on Monday. 
Henry McKinnell, chairman and CEO of Pfizer, together with Pharmacia head Fred Hassan visited the Swedish 
government for a one-hour briefing on Monday. 
"This is the first country I visit outside the U.S. together with Fred (Hassan). Sweden is important in the history of 
Pharmacia," McKinnell told Reuters after the meeting. 
"We know Sweden is a good place for research." 
Trade Minister Leif Pagrotsky said he was satisfied that the combined company would stay active in Sweden after 
the merger. 
"We got reassurances that the new company will continue to be active in research and development in Sweden," 
Pagrotsky said. 
Pfizer - even before the merger the largest pharmaceuticals firm in the world - will together with Pharmacia form 
a drugs behemoth with an R&D budget of $7 billion, 50 percent more than any competitor. 
Pharmacia was born through the merger of several small Swedish pharmaceutical companies. It then merged 
first with U.S. Upjohn in 1995 and in 2000 with Monsanto . The company has 3,650 employees in Sweden, mainly 
working with production.

With its acquisition of Pharmacia Corporation, drug behemoth Pfizer Inc. hopes that it's found the prescription for 
continued world domination. Already the biggest pharmaceutical company on the planet, with 8 percent of the 
global market, Pfizer's market share will swell to 11 percent when the deal closes. (Second-place 
GlaxoSmithKline plc holds a mere 7.3 percent in comparison.) 
The $55.4 billion stock deal, announced in mid-July, consolidates several hot sellers in the world's medicine 
cabinet. Pfizer's shelf of blockbusters includes the top-selling antidepressant Zoloft, the cholesterol-blocker 
Lipitor, and the impotence aid Viagra. Pharmacia manufactures the popular arthritis drug Celebrex, the anxiety 
aid Xanax, and the hair-loss remedy Rogaine. 
Pfizer investors will retain 77 percent of the new company, and Pharmacia stockholders will own 23 percent. The 
merger marks Pfizer's first foray into cancer treatments and ophthalmology. It also continues the recent trend 
among drugmakers to prospect for future blockbusters by buying rival companies. 
Current CEO Henry McKinnell remains at the helm of the fortified Pfizer, while Pharmacia's chief, Fred Hassan, 
will assume the role of vice-chairman. 
Pfizer had a hard time swallowing Pharmacia. The New York-based buyer wooed its Peapack, New 
Jersey-based neighbor for a year and a half before inking the deal. Pfizer's ardor was fanned by the success of 
Celebrex, which the two companies market together, and because Pharmacia is one of the few drug companies 
not currently dogged by generic competitors. Eleven of Pharmacia's 12 drugs have patents that won't expire until 
2010.

In its merger with Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, Inc., Nestle S.A. has put together a two-scoop sundae. Dreyer's will 
acquire Nestle's U.S. ice cream operations, but the Swiss sweets giant will run the show by increasing its stake in 
Dreyer's from 25 percent to 67 percent. Under the terms of the $2.5 billion deal, announced in mid-June, Dreyer's 
will remain independent and continue to trade on the Nasdaq until at least 2006. Dreyer's shareholders will then 
have the right to sell their stock to the company for $83 per share, and, in 2007, for $88 per share, giving Nestle a 
chance to take full control of the company. 
For now, the enlarged Dreyer's will continue to operate out of the company's Oakland headquarters, led by 
chairman and CEO T. Gary Rogers. The transaction is Nestle's latest effort to expand its American ice cream 
business, following its 2001 acquisition of the U.S. and Canadian licenses for Haagen-Dazs.

H.J. Heinz Company has decided to reorganize its cupboard by acquiring Del Monte Foods Company in a $2.8 
billion deal announced in mid-June. Heinz first spun off some of its weaker performers, including Star-Kist tuna 
and College Inn broths for humans, along with Kibbles 'N Bits and 9-Lives for the pet set. Del Monte acquired the 
properties, and then transferred 75 percent of its stock to Heinz. 
The complicated transaction, structured as a reverse Morris Trust, helped Heinz avoid a half-billion dollars in 
taxes. Because such deals are tax-free, they are popular, even though Congress tightened the restrictions on 
their use in 1997. However, several recent high-profile transactions have been set up as reverse Morris Trusts,

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Henry McKinnell expects U.S. antitrust regulators 
to submit a second request for data concerning the pharmaceutical giant's pending merger with Pharmacia Corp. 
(PHA) in early October. 
Speaking at the Bear Stearns Healthcare Conference in midtown Manhattan, McKinnell said he still hopes the 
$54 billion merger will close by the end of the year. The Securities and Exchange Commission audited both 
companies separately earlier this year as part of routine, three-year reviews. So McKinnell anticipates a "very fast 
review" from the agency. The SEC found the accounting of both companies sound, he said. 
Both companies have "a few products scattered around Europe" that may offer antitrust hang-ups for European 
approval, but none are significant contributors to either companies' revenue. 
Once the merger closes, McKinnell expects it could take two or three years to fully realize the synergies of the 
union. He reiterated that both companies estimate they can save more than $2.5 billion on the bottom line by 
joining. 
Their union comes when political sentiment toward the drug industry is at its worst. 
"Hostility has never been greater," McKinnell said. 
However, he feels that "the worst is behind us." 
It hasn't been smooth sailing in regulatory waters over the last few years, either. While research and development 
spending has quadrupled, Food and Drug Administration drug approvals remain virtually flat, McKinnell said. 
Much of that stems from the newer, more conservative stance the FDA has taken in looking at the risks of the 
revolutionary, "novel mechanisms of action" in many new drugs. The agency began asking for much more 
stringent safety data surrounding liver enzyme levels and cardiac risk. Since then, Pfizer and its competitors have 
been testing their drugs early on to fit these parameters. However, it will be a few years before these drugs face 
FDA approval. That said, expect to see a "sharp increase in productivity this decade," he said.

2002 AUG 16 - (NewsRx.com & NewsRx.net) -- Pfizer, Inc., added to its formidable strengths as the 
pharmaceutical industry's leader with a $60 billion acquisition of Pharmacia Corp. on July 15, 2002, pressuring its 
competitors toward similar mergers at a time of slimmer profits and angry consumers. 
The all-stock deal will create a pharmaceutical powerhouse with more than $48 billion in revenues and a research 
budget of more than $7 billion. With $26.3 billion in pharmaceutical sales, Pfizer is already the world's largest drug 
company and its research budget of $5 billion dwarfed the rest of the industry by more than 50%. Pharmacia is 
the ninth largest drug company with pharmaceutical revenues of $12 billion. 
The merger combined Pfizer's widely recognized prowess for marketing with Pharmacia's drugs in the areas of 
oncology and ophthalmology, where Pfizer does not have a strong presence. 
The companies said the merger should provide $2.5 billion in cost saving by 2005, a particularly important point at 
a time when drug companies are finding it harder to produce new blockbuster medicines and are under growing 
public and government pressure to hold down prices. 
"That this brings cost-savings is obvious," said Pfizer chief executive Henry McKinnell. "But it creates a company 
that can grow more than the two companies could separately. It also significantly eliminates risk by expanding the 
product and market areas of the company." 
Stephen Lederer, a Pfizer spokesman, said it's not immediately clear how the merger would affect the drug 
company's operations in Connecticut. 
Pfizer's largest research and development site is in Groton, where about 4500 employees work on a 160-acre 
campus, Lederer said. In adjacent New London, the company last year opened a global research and 
development headquarters where about 1500 employees work, he said. 
"Groton New London is the nerve center of the global research and development activity of Pfizer," Lederer said. 
"We are very proud of what happens in Connecticut." 
The merger is expected to result in savings as a result of duplicate positions, but it's unclear which positions 
would be affected, Lederer said. 
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said his office will investigate the merger. 
"Our analysis will be conducted on a market sector-by-sector basis, drug by drug, to safeguard against a 
concentration of market power," Blumenthal said July 15. "Consumers should have the benefit of more affordable 
medicine, particularly generic drugs." 
Pfizer manufacturers blockbusters such as cholesterol-lowering agent Lipitor and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, 
while Pharmacia makes the cancer drug Camptosar as well as Rogaine hair products and the Nicorette smoking 
cessation line. 
The companies already jointly market pain reliever Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra. The two drugs have 
already been outpacing new prescriptions of the competing product Vioxx, made by Merck & Co. 
The deal spells even more trouble for Merck, which has said its 2002 earnings will be flat because of patent 
expirations and slowing Vioxx sales. 
"It puts Merck at a disadvantage because you are going to see an even more unified approach to marketing the 
Celebrex and Bextra," said Tim Anderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities.

Page 16 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Merck has said it wants to remain independent, but analysts said in this environment it may not have a choice. 
Combinations of patent expirations, drug delays and manufacturing issues have cast a pall over most drug 
companies. Some, like Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Schering-Plough Corp., are considered especially troubled 
and could become targets for acquisition if their stocks continue to slide. 
"Bristol may not look good at $60, but it is a different picture at $20," said independent analyst Hemant Shah. 
Some analysts have suggested that Bristol-Myers' experience in cancer and cardiovascular drugs may 
complement GlaxoSmithKline's competence in areas like anti-infection drugs. Merck and Schering could be a 
good fit because they are already jointly developing a cholesterol-lowering agent. European players such as 
Novartis and Aventis are considered purchasers so they can expand their presence in the United States. 
"Mergers may not lead to more better products, but if the companies don't do them they will be far worse off," said 
Shah. 
As drug revenues slide, companies have even less money to put into research and development to create the 
products that will revive sales. By cutting costs they can generate some savings that can be applied to research, 
Shah said. 
Moreover, bigger companies with more products have more bargaining power with states and insurance 
companies that are increasingly balking at rising drug prices. Many states and insurance companies are using 
their bargaining power, creating preferred drug lists based in part on pharmaceutical companies' willingness to 
agree to a reduced price. 
The drug companies have less bargaining power: Even combined, Pfizer and Pharmacia will have about 13% of 
the world market for pharmaceuticals, according to IMS Health, Inc., a research firm. That relatively low number 
means analysts don't expect the deal to face major regulatory hurdles, especially since the two companies don't 
manufacture directly competing drugs. Pharmacia markets a bladder therapy drug and Pfizer is developing one, 
but that isn't viewed as a major problem. 
The companies acknowledged that there would be job cuts, but did not discuss a number. Pharmacia Corp. Chief 
Executive Fred Hassan said the move to place some employees into the former AT&T headquarters in New 
Jersey was on hold. 
As drug companies merge, they will need more drugs to sustain them. 
"After the consolidation of the industry is done, overall earnings growth will slow," Shah said. 
Pfizer is no stranger to mergers. It was able to squeeze $1.8 billion in savings from its hostile takeover of 
Warner-Lambert in 2000. 
In the short term, the deal will smooth over Pfizer's earnings when some drugs' patents expire. Antifungal agent 
Diflucan is set to lose market exclusivity in 2004 followed by depression drug Zoloft in 2005. Over the course of 
2003 and 2004, Pharmacia is slated to introduce new drugs for hypertension, anxiety, arthritis and pulmonary 
disease. 
"It is a good fit for both companies," said Banc of America analyst Len Yaffe. "And it should be interesting to 
watch what the other companies do." 
Under the deal, Pharmacia shareholders would receive 1.4 shares of Pfizer stock for each share in Pharmacia. 
That represents $45.08 worth of stock based on the July 12, 2002, closing Pfizer price and is a 36% premium 
over Pharmacia's closing price of $32.59 a share on July 12. 
On July 15, Pharmacia shares were up $7.32, or $22%, to $39.82 a share. The stock was that high 3 weeks 
previously but analysts said given the market conditions, the price Pfizer is paying is fair if not spectacular. 
"It may look like a steal in a lot of ways, but you just don't know where the market will be in a month or two," said 
Mark Hesse-Withroe, a research analyst at Victory Capital Management.

NEW YORK -- Pfizer Inc. is acquiring Pharmacia Corp. for $60 billion in a transaction that executives of both 
companies claim will position Pfizer for continued leadership in the rapidly changing pharmaceutical industry. 
The two drug firms have been partners since 1998 with the marketing of Celebrex, a top-selling arthritis 
medication. The joint introduction of Celebrex paved the way for the product to become the world's No. 1 branded 
treatment for arthritis and the seventh-most prescribed drug. It has since been prescribed to over 35 million 
patients throughout the world. 
In April Pfizer and Pharmacia sales representatives began promoting Bextra, another COX-2 inhibitor. 
Pfizer's shareholders will own about 77% of the combined company pending the expected closing of the 
transaction by the end of 2002. 
The Pfizer/Pharmacia merger, the largest in the industry in over a year, could put pressure on other 
pharmaceutical firms to either merge or form alliances. 
Since the two companies have few products that overlap, opposition from the Federal Trade Commission is not 
expected. 
The new health care company will have sales of approximately $48 billion and such top drugs as Zoloft, Lipitor 
and Viagra (all Pfizer) and Pharmacia's Celebrex and Bextra. 
Combined, says Pfizer, the new entity will have as many as a dozen products that have annual revenues 
exceeding $1 billion. 
The research and development pipeline will incorporate almost 120 new chemical entities in development as well 
as more than 80 product enhancement programs. For example, Pharmacia's pipeline includes treatments for 
cardiovascular disease, central nervous system disorders and ophthalmic conditions. 
Pfizer says its already strong therapeutic portfolio will be enhanced through the strength that Pharmacia brings in 
such areas as endocrinology, oncology and ophthalmology. 
"This is an extraordinary opportunity to combine two of the fastest-growing and most innovative pharmaceutical 
companies and to position Pfizer for sustained long-term leadership of the global pharmaceutical industry," 
asserts Hank McKinnell, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive officer. 
"By combining with Pharmacia, we are ensuring our core capabilities in the discovery, development and 
commercialization of new medicines are strong around the world." 
He adds that although advances in the understanding of disease will result in significantly more drug discovery 
targets, the research costs into those potential therapies will also grow proportionately. The merger will help the 
company to control such costs. 
"We intend to meet these challenges head on," he insists. "Our new company will be positioned to deliver a 
stream of innovative new products and cost-effective health are solutions. With Pharmacia we will have the 
products, pipeline, scale and financial flexibility to extend our leadership." 
Fred Hassan, chairman and chief executive officer of Pharmacia and designated vice chairman of the new 
company, says the acquisition creates a global pharmaceutical firm that will have unsurpassed resources and 
capabilities.

"Our companies are already highly effective partners as shown by the extraordinary success of the COX-2 
products," he points out. "A strategic combination with the industry leader, Pfizer, will now give us the opportunity 
to maximize the potential of both our current products and our pipeline." 
McKinnell cites such major benefits of the combined entity as an extensive product portfolio, the stronger pipeline 
and expanded research and development program and enhanced scale and financial flexibility. 
"By combining Pfizer with Pharmacia we will have the financial and human resources to bring new product 
opportunities to the market and to fund them to their full potential," maintains McKinnell. 
Pharmacia will proceed with its previously announced plan to spin off its remaining ownership (84%) of Monsanto 
Co. to its shareholders.

TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Drug giant Pfizer Inc.'s plan to acquire Peapack-based Pharmacia won't cause significant 
layoffs in New Jersey and could eventually bring more jobs, Pfizer's top executive told Gov. James E. McGreevey 
Thursday. 
During a briefing with reporters, McGreevey said he met earlier Thursday with Pfizer's chief executive officer, 
Henry McKinnell, to discuss the impact of the pending merger on the companies' New Jersey workers. 
"Mr. McKinnell - who is a giant within the pharmaceutical industry, and the pharmaceutical industry is critically 
important to the state of New Jersey - has affirmed Pfizer's long-term commitment to the state of New Jersey, 
indeed the likely prospect that over time Pfizer will actually be expanding operations within the state of New 
Jersey," McGreevey said. 
The two men also discussed the importance of patent protection for research-based industries, he said. 
Pfizer, already the world's biggest drug company, on July 15 announced plans to buy Pharmacia, the 
ninth-largest drug company, for about $60 billion in stock. The deal, set to close by year's end, would build a 
pharmaceutical powerhouse with over $48 billion in revenues. 
Such mergers frequently trigger layoffs, as companies eliminate overlapping jobs and try to increase efficiency. 
Pharmacia has about 2,200 workers in New Jersey and 59,000 worldwide. New York-based Pfizer has 4,200 
New Jersey employees, including many in Morris Plains, where drug and confectionery maker Warner-Lambert 
was based. Pfizer acquired that company in 2000.

'The combined group will have 12 products with sales greater than 1bn dollars' 
WHEN Henry McKinnell took over as chief executive of Pfizer two years ago, his predecessor charged him with 
ensuring it held on to its position as the world's largest drugs company. 
"We're number one and now Hank has to figure out how to keep us there," William Steere said at the time. 
"I don't think you've seen anything yet," McKinnell replied. 
He lived up to that promise last week, surprising investors and sending shockwaves through the boardrooms of 
industry rivals by announcing a $60bn all-share merger with fellow US drugs company Pharmacia. 
The deal failed to inspire investors, who are concerned that the combined group may not be able to sustain 
earnings growth without further consolidation. 
But for industry rivals the prospect of a Pfizer/Pharmacia combine is unsettling. The question for them is whether 
the deal will set a new industry standard and, if so, how can companies reach a similar size if not through 
consolidation? 
On paper, Pfizer/Pharmacia is a daunting competitor that leaves its rivals trailing on all counts. With sales of 
more than $46bn, the merged group will dominate all major markets and command a global market share of 
about 11%, far exceeding the 7% of GlaxoSmithKline, the world's second largest drugs group. In Europe, Pfizer 
will jump from fourth to first and in Japan from third to first. 
The combined group will have 12 products with sales greater than $1bn. One of Pharmacia's main attractions for 
Pfizer was its best-selling anti-inflammation drug, Celebrex, in which Pfizer already has a stake and which earned 
both companies $3.1bn in sales last year; another is Xalatan, which treats glaucoma and has annual sales of 
more than $1bn. 
McKinnell expects to achieve 10% compound sales growth and 19% earnings growth to 2004, including $2.5bn of 
cost savings; they will have to materialise if Pfizer is to justify paying a 44% premium on Pharmacia's share price. 
In research and development terms, the group will have recourse to $7bn per year and a pipeline of products that 
includes 120 new chemical entities and 80 product line extensions. This compares with Glaxo's R&D budget of 
about $3.7bn. 
Crucially too, if the deal goes ahead, Pfizer would command the industry's largest marketing force, with its sales 
force swelling from 8,000 to 13,000 in the US market, which accounts for 40% of global drug sales. 
Industry analysts say it will be marketing muscle that will set Pfizer apart, especially in the light of increasing 
competition among drugs companies to license best-selling medicines from biotechnology companies. 
The question, says UBS Warburg pharmaceuticals analyst David Beadle, is: "Can other companies outbid Pfizer 
for such deals?" It is just one of the questions that McKinnell's rivals will be contemplating.

Pfizer Had Long Road In Pursuing Pharmacia --- It Took 1 1/2 Years of Wooing To Secure All-Stock Deal 
Valued at $53.38 Billion

Pfizer Inc. wooed Pharmacia Corp. for a year and a half before winning it over with its $53.38 billion all-stock 
offer over the weekend. 
Scarcely six months after the Warner-Lambert Co. deal closed in June 2000, Henry McKinnell, Pfizer's chairman 
and chief executive, already was sizing up his next move. From the start, he had his eye on Pharmacia closest of 
all, he said Monday. 
The main allure: the success of Celebrex, the blockbuster arthritis medicine the companies market together, and 
Pharmacia's cancer franchise, something Pfizer has been unable to build from scratch after 10 years of trying. 
For more than a year and half, Mr. McKinnell floated various ideas about a deeper combination between the two 
companies with his counterpart Fred Hassan at Pharmacia. 
Eplerenone, a Pharmacia blood-pressure drug awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, provided a 
catalyst for the most recent round of talks because it dovetails with Pfizer's Lipitor, for cholesterol, and Norvasc, 
another blood-pressure remedy, and Pharmacia will need a hand selling it, Mr. McKinnell said. 
The companies have confirmed terms of the deal, a result of sporadic but ultimately intense negotiations. 
Executives at both firms were uncertain how investors would react and braced for the market open. Monday, the 
market punished Pfizer, sending its shares down $3.42, or 11%, to $28.78, while Pharmacia was up $6.66, or 
20%, at $39.25 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
With its offer for Pharmacia, Pfizer made clear that it hadn't inoculated itself against the problems that plague the 
entire pharmaceuticals industry just by buying Warner-Lambert. Pfizer, like its rivals, faces growing pressure on 
prices in markets around the world, and a slowdown in the introduction of new medicines. 
Indeed, Pfizer released second-quarter earnings Monday, two days earlier than scheduled, and the results 
revealed slight weakness, though they were in line with expectations. Pfizer said net income rose 7% to $1.96 
billion, or 32 cents a share, from $1.83 billion, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5% to $8.03 
billion. 
Pfizer executives said the next quarter would be tough but a strong fourth quarter would allow the company to 
meet double-digit revenue and earnings growth targets for the year. 
If the Pharmacia acquisition is completed by year end, Pfizer will have bought several years of breathing room 
with cost savings expected to total $2.5 billion, new products, and a chance to reinvigorate the Pharmacia 
franchise of arthritis drugs that includes Celebrex and Bextra. 
Early talks between the companies were informal. Mr. McKinnell and Mr. Hassan, who have known each other for 
a decade, saw each other often at meetings of the drug industry's main trade group, known as PhRMA. Earlier 
this year, Mr. Hassan succeeded Mr. McKinnell as chairman and chief executive of PhRMA. 
Mr. McKinnell kept pestering Mr. Hassan about a deal. And Mr. Hassan kept putting him off. 
The turning point came in early April, when they were both at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta to 
prepare 5,000 sales representatives from both companies for the launch of Bextra, an arthritis drug that is 
expected to succeed blockbuster Celebrex.

"It looks like we ought to get more serious," Mr. McKinnell said to Mr. Hassan during a five-minute conversation 
after both men had addressed the group. "No," Mr. Hassan responded quickly and unequivocally. "We were still 
committed to going it alone," he recalled Monday. 
Nevertheless, both executives re-examined the potential benefits of linking up afterward. "Independently, we 
came to the conclusion this would be a great combination," Mr. McKinnell said. 
More serious but still preliminary discussions got rolling in late May. Last month at a midtown New York hotel, 
executives from both companies quickly agreed on structure and management issues. They remained far apart, 
however, on price. Pfizer was discussing a share ratio of between 1.2 and 1.3 shares of its stock for each 
Pharmacia share, while Pharmacia demanded 1.4. 
By late June the talks stalled, and Pharmacia prepared to walk away. Just before the Fourth of July weekend, 
however, Pfizer upped its offer to between 1.3 and 1.4 shares, according to people familiar with the situation. 
"That was the breakthrough," said one person who was there. 
Due diligence began on July 2, Mr. McKinnell said. On July Fourth, teams of bankers, lawyers, accountants and 
corporate executives converged at the Intercontinental Hotel in New York and worked round the clock for a week. 
In recognition of current fears of hidden accounting blow-ups, Pfizer pored over Pharmacia's books and picked 
through its research pipeline. The Pharmacia team rigorously examined Pfizer, too. "This was due diligence like 
I've never seen it before," said one person close to the talks. 
By last Friday, the two teams presented the deal to the boards. While Pfizer's board supported the deal, at least 
two members of Pharmacia's board were initially reluctant to sell the company at such a low share price because 
of its recent highs. Eventually, Mr. Hassan convinced his board that because the deal would be done with Pfizer 
stock, the combined companies' value would likely appreciate. 
Indeed, this deal is notable because it lacks a "collar" -- a mechanism for changing the ratios of stock if the shares 
of one or both of the companies swing wildly out of the expected range. People close to the situation said 
Pharmacia initially demanded a collar, but Pfizer refused. During the negotiations, Pfizer eventually raised its 
offer high enough to make Pharmacia comfortable without that protection. 
Still, the falling share price of Pfizer today could give Pharmacia investors pause in supporting the deal.

NEW YORK 
Pfizer Inc. on Monday added to its formidable strengths as the pharmaceutical industry's leader with a $60 billion 
acquisition of Pharmacia Corp. The move might push its competitors toward similar mergers at a time of slimmer 
profits and angry consumers. 
The all-stock deal will create a pharmaceutical powerhouse with more than $48 billion in revenue and a research 
budget of more than $7 billion. 
Pfizer, with $26.3 billion in pharmaceutical sales, is the world's largest drug company, and its research budget of 
$5 billion dwarfs the rest of the industry by more than 50 percent. Pharmacia is the ninth-largest drug company 
with pharmaceutical revenues of $12 billion. 
The merger combined Pfizer's widely recognized prowess for marketing with Pharmacia's drugs in the areas of 
oncology and ophthalmology, where Pfizer lacks a strong presence. 
The companies said the merger should provide yearly cost savings of $2.5 billion by 2005, a particularly important 
point at a time when drug companies are finding it harder to produce new blockbuster medicines and are under 
growing public and government pressure to hold down prices. 
"That this brings cost-savings is obvious," Pfizer Chief Executive Henry McKinnell said. "But it creates a 
company that can grow more than the two companies could separately. It also significantly eliminates risk by 
expanding the product and market areas." 
Pfizer manufactures blockbusters such as cholesterol-lowering agent Lipitor and erectile-dysfunction drug Viagra, 
and Pharmacia makes the cancer drug Camptosar as well as Rogaine hair products and the Nicorette 
smoking-cessation line. 
The companies jointly market pain reliever Celebrex and its successor, Bextra. The two drugs are outpacing new 
prescriptions of the competing product Vioxx, made by Merck & Co. 
The deal spells even more trouble for Merck, which has said its 2002 earnings will be flat because of expiring 
patents and slowing Vioxx sales. 
"It puts Merck at a disadvantage because you are going to see an even more-unified approach to marketing the 
Celebrex and Bextra," said Tim Anderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities. 
Merck has said it wants to remain independent, but analysts said it might not have a choice. 
Combinations of patent expirations, drug delays and manufacturing issues have cast a pall over most drug 
companies. Some, like Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Schering-Plough Corp., are considered especially troubled 
and could become targets for acquisition if their stocks continue to slide. 
"Bristol may not look good at $60, but it is a different picture at $20," independent analyst Hemant Shah said.

Some analysts suggested that Bristol-Myers' experience in cancer and cardiovascular drugs might complement 
GlaxoSmithKline's competence in areas like anti-infection drugs. 
Merck and Schering could be a good fit because they are already jointly developing a cholesterol-lowering agent. 
European players such as Novartis and Aventis are considered purchasers so they can expand their presence in 
the United States. 
"Mergers may not lead to more better products, but if the companies don't do them they will be far worse off," said 
Shah. 
As drug revenues slide, companies have even less money to put into research and development to create the 
products that will revive sales. By cutting costs they can generate some savings that can be applied to research, 
Shah said. 
Moreover, bigger companies with more products have more bargaining power with states and insurance 
companies that are increasingly balking at rising drug prices. Many states and insurance companies are using 
their bargaining power, creating preferred drug lists based in part on pharmaceutical companies' willingness to 
agree to a reduced price. 
The drug companies have less bargaining power: Even combined, Pfizer and Pharmacia will have about 13 
percent of the world market for pharmaceuticals, according to IMS Health Inc., a research firm. 
That relatively low number means analysts don't expect the deal to face major regulatory hurdles, especially since 
the two companies don't manufacture directly competing drugs. Pharmacia markets a bladder-therapy drug and 
Pfizer is developing one, but that isn't viewed as a major problem. 
The companies acknowledged that there would be job cuts, but didn't discuss a number. Also, Pharmacia Corp. 
Chief Executive Fred Hassan said the move to place some employees into the former AT&T headquarters in New 
Jersey was on hold. 
As drug companies merge, they will need more drugs to sustain them. "After the consolidation of the industry is 
done, overall earnings growth will slow," Shah said. 
Pfizer is no stranger to mergers. It was able to squeeze $1.8 billion in savings from its hostile takeover of 
Warner-Lambert in 2000. 
"It may look like a steal in a lot of ways, but you just don't know where the market will be in a month or two," said 
Mark Hesse-Withroe, a research analyst at Victory Capital Management.

Prescription for Growth: Hassan Hones the Art of the Deal

The last time Fred Hassan was involved in a blockbuster drug-industry deal, he was decidedly on the defensive. 
Two and a half years ago, the Pharmacia Corp. chief executive had agreed to merge his company with Monsanto 
Co., and investors gave the announcement a poor reception. 
Mr. Hassan stuck by his belief in the deal. "We are going to make this into a pharmaceutical powerhouse," he 
declared at the time of the acquisition. 
In agreeing to sell Pharmacia to Pfizer Inc. for $60 billion (60.56 billion euros) in stock, he has in a fashion 
delivered on this promise -- helping to create by far the world's largest drug company. And he has established 
himself as a successful industry-turnaround artist. 
"Fred Hassan has made a career out of taking broken pieces and putting them together and making them work," 
a person familiar with the deal said. For Mr. Hassan, the Pfizer offer represented a way for Pharmacia and its 
shareholders "to participate in the biggest, and the best and hopefully the fastest-growing company that could 
bring the most new products to market the soonest," this person said. 
It was through Monsanto's Searle unit that Mr. Hassan acquired the blockbuster arthritis drug Celebrex that both 
revived Pharmacia's financial performance and set up a relationship with Pfizer that ultimately led to the current 
transaction. 
But Mr. Hassan has never made a secret of his desire to continue his deal-making. Almost as soon as the ink was 
dry on the Monsanto merger, he began talking openly of yet another deal. The object of his desires: Wyeth, where 
he spent years as a senior executive. In private conversations, Mr. Hassan often said he would love to merge 
Pharmacia with his old company. 
When Wyeth -- then known as American Home Products Corp. -- lost out to Pfizer in its bid to acquire 
Warner-Lambert Co., Mr. Hassan seemed poised to step in as a rebound suitor. It didn't happen. Through a 
mixture of luck and good science, Wyeth has recovered and no longer needs a partner. So Mr. Hassan had to 
look elsewhere to build the behemoth he has envisioned much of his career. Going with Pfizer, he has agreed to 
surrender control of his company: Henry McKinnell of Pfizer will remain as chairman and CEO. Mr. Hassan will 
be vice chairman. 
When Mr. Hassan left a top post at AHP in 1997 to take the helm of Pharmacia, the company was known as 
Pharmacia & Upjohn and it was in deep trouble. Sales were declining and the company -- with operations in 
Sweden, Michigan and Italy -- was still reeling from the 1995 merger in which it was formed. 
Mr. Hassan persuaded the board to relocate the company's headquarters to the U.S., eased out recalcitrant 
executives and ordered up a list of experimental drugs in development. He cut several projects he didn't think 
would be clear winners in the marketplace and then set about trying to diversify the company's product line 
beyond Celebrex. Indeed, even before the Monsanto acquisition, Pharmacia acquired Sugen Inc. to bolster its 
cancer franchise, currently dominated by the chemotherapy agent Camptostar. 
Two years ago, Mr. Hassan took direct control of Pharmacia's fierce battle to maintain Celebrex's dominance 
over Merck & Co.'s rival pill, Vioxx. Merck appeared to be on the verge of winning that war. Through a 
no-holds-barred negative campaign against Vioxx -- and with a lucky break from a highly publicized study that 
suggested heart concerns with Vioxx but didn't suggest any with Celebrex, the Pharmacia product not only 
stayed on top of Vioxx but also is now pulling away again.

As for the reason the Monsanto deal caused so much investor consternation? There wasn't a premium for 
investors, who also worried that Monsanto's agriculture business would be a drag on pharmaceutical business 
performance. Before any deal with Pfizer closes, Pharmacia is moving forward with plans to spin off the 83% of 
Monsanto it still owns.

NEW YORK -- Pfizer Inc. added to its formidable strengths as the pharmaceutical industry's leader with a $60 
billion acquisition of Pharmacia Corp. on Monday, pressuring its competitors toward similar mergers at a time of 
slimmer profits and angry consumers. 
The all-stock deal will create a pharmaceutical powerhouse with over $48 billion in revenues and a research 
budget of more than $7 billion. With $26.3 billion in pharmaceutical sales, Pfizer is already the world's largest drug 
company and its research budget of $5 billion dwarfed the rest of the industry by more than 50 percent. 
Pharmacia is the ninth largest drug company with pharmaceutical revenues of $12 billion. 
The merger combined Pfizer's widely recognized prowess for marketing with Pharmacia's drugs in the areas of 
oncology and ophthalmology, where Pfizer does not have a strong presence. 
The companies said the merger should provide $2.5 billion in cost saving by 2005, a particularly important point at 
a time when drug companies are finding it harder to produce new blockbuster medicines and are under growing 
public and government pressure to hold down prices. 
"That this brings cost-savings is obvious," said Pfizer chief executive Henry McKinnell. "But it creates a company 
that can grow more than the two companies could separately. It also significantly eliminates risk by expanding the 
product and market areas of the company." 
Pfizer manufacturers blockbusters such as cholesterol-lowering agent Lipitor and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, 
while Pharmacia makes the cancer drug Camptosar as well as Rogaine hair products and the Nicorette smoking 
cessation line. 
The companies already jointly market pain reliever Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra. The two drugs have 
already been outpacing new prescriptions of the competing product Vioxx, made by Merck &Co. 
The deal spells even more trouble for Merck, which has said its 2002 earnings will be flat because of patent 
expirations and slowing Vioxx sales. 
"It puts Merck at a disadvantage because you are going to see an even more unified approach to marketing the

Merck has said it wants to remain independent, but analysts said in this environment it may not have a choice.

and could become targets for acquisition if their stocks continue to slide.

Pfizer Inc. added to its formidable strength as the pharmaceutical industry's leader with the $60 billion (U.S.) 
acquisition of Pharmacia Corp. yesterday that will put pressure on its competitors to merge as well. 
The all-stock deal will create a pharmaceutical powerhouse with more than $48 billion in revenue and a research

already been outpacing new prescriptions of the competing product Vioxx, made by Merck & Co. 
"It is a good fit for both companies," said Banc of America analyst Len Yaffe. "And it should be interesting to 
watch what the other companies do." 
Under the deal, Pharmacia shareholders would receive 1.4 shares of Pfizer stock for each share in Pharmacia. 
That represents $45.08 worth of stock based on Friday's closing price for Pfizer and is a 36 per cent premium 
over Pharmacia's closing price of $32.59 a share on Friday. 
The companies acknowledged that there would be job cuts, but did not discuss a number. Pharmacia chief 
executive Fred Hassan said the move to place some employees into the former AT&T headquarters in New 
Jersey was on hold. 
Pfizer also announced yesterday that its second-quarter net income rose 7 per cent to $1.96 billion, or 32 cents a 
share, from $1.83 billion, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. The performance matched the forecasts of analysts 
surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Revenues rose 5 per cent to $8 billion from $7.6 billion a year earlier. Sales of Lipitor rose 24 per cent to $1.8 
billion while revenues from Viagra grew 10 per cent to $385 million.

The Saigon Times Daily 
SGTD 
English 
(c) 2002 Saigon Times Group 
(REUTERS-NEW YORK) Pfizer Inc., the world's largest drug firm, will acquire smaller rival Pharmacia Corp. for 
US$60 billion in stock, published reports said yesterday, creating an industry behemoth with a broad array of 
best-selling products. 
The transaction was expected to be announced later yesterday, said the New York Times' and Wall Street 
Journal's Web sites, citing people familiar with the matter. 
The merger would create an industry giant boasting more than US$48 billion in annual revenue and combine 
several top-selling drugs, including Pfizer's Viagra and Lipitor, the popular cholesterol-lowering drug, along with 
Pharmacia's top-selling arthritis drugs, Celebrex and Bextra. 
It also would bolster Pfizer's already strong position as the top drug maker in the United States, while vaulting it to 
top spots in Europe, Japan and Latin America, the New York Times said. 
Pfizer and Pharmacia did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 
Terms of the transaction call for New York-based Pfizer to exchange 1.4 of its shares for each Pharmacia share, 
the papers said. That would value the Peapack, New Jersey-based Pharmacia at US$45.08 per share, a 38% 
premium to the company's closing price Friday of US$32.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Pfizer shareholders would own 77% of the combined company, the papers said, and its chairman and chief 
executive, Henry McKinnell, would retain the same titles after the merger. Pharmacia Chairman and CEO Fred 
Huggan will become vice-chairman of the company's board. 
The transaction has been approved by the boards of both companies, the reports said. Pharmacia also intends to 
continue with its previously announced plan to spin off its 84% stake in U.S.-based agricultural products maker 
Monsanto Co., the papers said. 
The deal comes as large drug companies around the world scramble to consolidate as an overall slowdown in 
revenues and new drugs hit the market. Pfizer pulled off one of the most successful mergers in recent memory 
when it acquired rival Warner-Lambert Co. in February 2000 for US$114 billion. 
It also marks the largest acquisition proposal in what has been an otherwise dismal year Global merger volume 
was down almost 50% through the first six months of 2002, said research firm Thomson Financial.

NEW YORK - Pfizer Inc. added to its formidable strengths as the pharmaceutical industry's leader with a 
$60-billion acquisition of Pharmacia Corp. yesterday, pressuring its competitors toward similar mergers at a time 
of slimmer profits and angry consumers. 
The all-stock deal will create a pharmaceutical powerhouse with more than $48 billion in revenues and a research 
budget of more than $7 billion. Pfizer is already the world's largest drug company when measured by the overall 
value of its stock. 
About 325 Rhode Islanders work at Pfizer's world headquarters for research and development in New London, 
Conn. and another facility in Groton. 
The merger combined Pfizer's widely recognized prowess for marketing with Pharmacia's drugs in the areas of 
oncology and ophthalmology, where Pfizer does not have a strong presence. 
The companies said the merger should provide $2.5 billion in cost savings by 2005, a particularly important point 
at a time when drug companies are finding it harder to produce new blockbuster medicines and are under 
growing public and government pressure to hold down prices. 
"That this brings cost savings is obvious," said Pfizer chief executive officer Henry McKinnell. "But it creates a 
company that can grow more than the two companies could separately. It also significantly eliminates risk by 
expanding the product and market areas of the company." 
"By combining with Pharmacia, we are ensuring that our core capabilities in the discovery, development and 
commercialization of new medicines are strong around the world," McKinnell said. 
Pfizer manufactures blockbusters such as the cholesterol- lowering agent Lipitor and erectile dysfunction drug 
Viagra, while Pharmacia makes the cancer drug Camptosar as well as Rogaine hair products and the Nicorette 
smoking cessation line. 
The companies already jointly market the pain reliever Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra. The two drugs 
have already been outpacing new prescriptions of the competing product Vioxx, made by Merck &Co. 
Fred Hassan, chairman and chief executive officer of Pharmacia, said the deal "is a strategic opportunity that 
immediately creates a global pharmaceutical company with unsurpassed resources and capabilities." 
The pact spells even more trouble for Merck, which has said its 2002 earnings will be flat because of patent 
expirations and slowing Vioxx sales. 
"It puts Merck at a disadvantage because you are going to see an even more unified approach to marketing the 
Celebrex and Bextra," said Tim Anderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities. 
Merck has said it wants to remain independent, but analysts said in this environment it may not have a choice. 
Combinations of patent expirations, drug delays and manufacturing issues have cast a pall over most drug 
companies. Some, like Bristol- Myers Squibb Co. and Schering-Plough Corp., are considered especially troubled 
and could become targets for acquisition if their stocks continue to slide. 
"Bristol may not look good at $60, but it is a different picture at $20," said independent analyst Hemant Shah.

Some analysts have suggested that Bristol-Myers' experience in cancer and cardiovascular drugs may 
complement GlaxoSmith-Kline's competence in areas such as anti-infection drugs. Merck and Schering could be 
a good fit because they are already jointly developing a cholesterol-lowering agent. European players such as 
Novartis and Aventis are considered purchasers so they can expand their presence in the United States. 
"Mergers may not lead to more better products, but if the companies don't do them they will be far worse off," said 
Shah. 
As drug revenues slide, companies have even less money to put into research and development to create the 
products that will revive sales. By cutting costs they can generate some savings that can be applied to research, 
Shah said. 
Moreover, bigger companies with more products are seeking more bargaining power with states and insurance 
companies that are increasingly balking at rising drug prices. Many states and insurance companies are using 
their bargaining clout, creating preferred drug lists based in part on pharmaceutical companies' willingness to 
agree to a reduced price. 
Unfortunately for them, the drug companies have less leverage than the opposing agencies: Even combined, 
Pfizer and Pharmacia will have about 13 percent of the U.S. market for pharmaceuticals. 
As the companies merge, they will need more drugs to sustain them. 
"After the consolidation of the industry is done, overall earnings growth will slow," Shah said. 
Pfizer is no stranger to mergers. It was able to squeeze $1.8 billion in savings from its hostile takeover of 
Warner-Lambert in 2000. 
In the short term, the deal will smooth over Pfizer's earnings when some drugs' patents expire. The antifungal 
agent Diflucan is set to lose market exclusivity in 2004 followed by the depression drug Zoloft in 2005. Over the 
course of 2003 and 2004, Pharmacia is slated to introduce new drugs for hypertension, anxiety, arthritis and 
pulmonary disease. 
"It is a good fit for both companies," said Banc of America analyst Len Yaffe. "And it should be interesting to 
watch what the other companies do." 
Under the deal, Pharmacia shareholders would receive 1.4 shares of Pfizer stock for each share in Pharmacia. 
That represents $45.08 worth of stock based on Friday's closing Pfizer price and is a 36- percent premium over 
Pharmacia's closing price of $32.59 a share on Friday. 
Yesterday, Pharmacia shares were up $7.32, or $22 percent, to $39.82 a share. The stock was that high three 
weeks ago but analysts said given the market conditions, the price Pfizer is paying is fair if not spectacular. 
"It may look like a steal in a lot of ways, but you just don't know where the market will be in a month or two," said 
Mark Hesse- Withroe, a research analyst at Victory Capital Management.

Pfizer Inc. added to its strengths as the pharmaceutical industry's leader with a $60 billion acquisition of 
Pharmacia Corp. yesterday. 
The all-stock deal will create a pharmaceutical powerhouse with more than $48 billion in revenue and a research 
budget of more than $7 billion. Pfizer is already the world's largest drug company when measured by the overall 
value of its stock. 
The merger combines Pfizer's widely recognized prowess for marketing with Pharmacia's drugs in oncology and 
ophthalmology, areas in which Pfizer does not have a strong presence. 
The companies said the merger should provide $2.5 billion in cost saving by 2005, important at a time when drug 
companies are finding it harder to produce new blockbuster medicines and are under public and government 
pressure to hold down prices. 
"That this brings cost savings is obvious," Pfizer chief executive officer Henry McKinnell said. "But it creates a 
company that can grow more than the two companies could separately. It also significantly eliminates risk by 
expanding the product and market areas of the company." 
Pfizer manufactures blockbusters such as cholesterol-lowering agent Lipitor and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. 
Pharmacia makes the cancer drug Camptosar as well as Rogaine hair products and the Nicorette 
smoking-cessation line. 
The companies already jointly market pain reliever Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra. The two drugs have 
already been outpacing new prescriptions of the competing product Vioxx, made by Merck & Co. Inc. 
The deal spells even more trouble for Merck, which has said its 2002 earnings would be flat because of patent 
expirations and slowing Vioxx sales. 
Combinations of patent expirations, drug delays and manufacturing issues have cast a pall over most drug 
companies. 
As drug revenue slides, companies have even less money to put into research and development to create the 
products that will revive sales. By cutting costs, they can generate some savings that can be applied to research, 
independent analyst Hemant Shah said. 
Moreover, bigger companies with more products have more bargaining power with states and insurance 
companies that increasingly balk at rising drug prices. 
In the short term, the deal will smooth over Pfizer's earnings when some drugs' patents expire. Antifungal agent 
Diflucan is set to lose market exclusivity in 2004 followed by depression drug Zoloft in 2005. Over the course of 
2003 and 2004, Pharmacia is scheduled to introduce new drugs for hypertension, anxiety, arthritis and 
pulmonary disease. 
Yesterday, Pharmacia shares closed up $6.66 at $39.25 a share. Pfizer shares closed down $3.42 at $28.78.

New Drug Giant to Rise Out of Pfizer, Pharmacia Merger. 
New Drug Giant to Rise Out of Pfizer, Pharmacia Merger.

Jul. 16-Two prescription drug powerhouses, which account for about 60 percent of the state's 16,000 life-science 
jobs, will combine to become the world's biggest pharmaceutical company in a $60-billion deal announced 
Monday. 
Pfizer Inc., the maker of the anti-impotence drug Viagra, has agreed to buy Pharmacia Corp., which makes 
Rogaine hair products and Celebrex, an arthritis drug. The combined company would have $48 billion in sales - 
$39 billion of which would come from prescription drug sales. 
The companies say it's too early to tell what the deal - which is expected to save them $1.4 billion in 2003 and 
$2.2 billion in 2004 - would mean to jobs in Michigan. 
Many supporters of Michigan's burgeoning life-science industry say the deal will probably lead to administrative 
job cuts worldwide, but that the many research and development jobs in Michigan are likely to survive. 
Pharmacia has about 6,300 employees and 2,000 full-time contract workers in Kalamazoo County. Pfizer has 
about 3,600 workers in the state, mostly in Ann Arbor. 
The Pfizer and Pharmacia jobs center on drug research and development. 
Pharmaceutical companies tend to "cut costs by combining manufacturing or reducing administration and 
overhead," said Jan Gensheimer, executive director of the Michigan Biosciences Industry Association. 
Drugmakers don't usually cut research and development because that is where ideas for new products begin, she 
said. 
Gensheimer said the deal would give Michigan more clout in the biotech and pharmaceutical world. 
"We're going to have two R&D facilities in the state for what will be the biggest pharmaceutical company in the 
world," she said. "That's great news for the state." 
In the last three years, the state has invested $145 million in the effort to build Michigan's life-science industry. 
Private and academic investment in life-sciences research and industry has topped $3 billion in the same period. 
Nevertheless, some people are more cautious than Gensheimer about the Pfizer deal. 
Barry Broome, executive director with Southwest Michigan First, an economic development group in Kalamazoo, 
said Pfizer's aggressive cost-cutting plan means it likely will have to cut jobs somewhere. 
"It's hard to determine where those body counts will be," Broome said. "We may take some losses in the short 
run." 
Even as few as 250 jobs cuts in Kalamazoo would have a big impact, Broome said. 
Broome said Kalamazoo is trying to position itself as a biotech center by creating a life-science-friendly 
community that includes a $13-million industrial park project. The project is intended to lure companies that can 
grow from the talent pool created by Pharmacia's presence in the city. 
At Pfizer in Ann Arbor, where the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor was developed, job security might be a little 
more certain since Pfizer announced plans in 2000 to spend $800 million to expand its center and add as many 
as 250 jobs. 
Meanwhile, it's too early to tell how this deal would affect consumers, but some worry that consolidation could 
lead to higher drug prices.

"People pay higher prices if there is a lack of competition; that's the way it looks on its face," said Harvey Hollins, 
a lobbyist with the AARP, a group that represents senior citizens. "The company may produce some innovative 
drugs as result of being a larger company or they may not, but what's clear is that there is one less company 
competing against Pfizer." 
But Charles Rothstein, managing director of Beringea, a Farmington Hills investment banking firm that follows 
health care businesses, said the deal makes sense because the companies have few if any overlapping products 
and because they have worked together on projects. 
"It's a natural progression for two companies that are friendly to move toward a merger," Rothstein said. 
The new company will be able to use its size to offer more products more efficiently at a time when drug 
companies are under pressure to keep costs low, Rothstein said. At the same time, the companies search for 
new drugs and face competition from cheaper generic versions of their older drugs, he said. 
The deal gives Pfizer, known for its strong marketing and sales force, access to new products including Xalatan, 
for glaucoma treatment, and Detrol, for incontinence therapy, Rothstein said. 
The deal, which is expected to win regulatory approval, boosted Pharmacia's stock, which closed Monday at 
$39.25 a share, up $6.66 or 20.4 percent a share. 
But Pfizer's stock took a hit, closing Monday at $28.78, down 10.62 percent or $3.42. The decline was blamed on 
smaller-than-expected second-quarter sales, which were announced Monday along with the deal. Revenue in the 
quarter reached $8 billion, down from the $8.25 billion expected by analysts. 
Both companies have a long history in Michigan. 
Kalamazoo got its pharmaceutical roots in 1886 when the Upjohn Pill and Granule Co. was founded. In 1995, 
Pharmacia bought the Upjohn Co. 
Parke-Davis started in Detroit in the late 1800s and built a research center in Ann Arbor. It was bought out by 
Warner-Lambert, which was taken over by Pfizer about two years ago for $92.3 billion, said Howard Markel, 
professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan. 
Once Upjohn and Parke-Davis were bought out, nearly all of the administrative jobs were moved to the 
headquarters of the parent companies, leaving only research and development in Michigan, Markel said.

Pfizer Buys Pharmacia in $60 Billion Deal. 
Pfizer Buys Pharmacia in $60 Billion Deal.

Jul. 16-Open your medicine cabinet today and you likely will find a product that falls under the now-larger 
umbrella of pharmaceutical colossus Pfizer Inc., which this weekend signed an agreement to purchase 
Pharmacia Corp., makers of everything from such over-the-counter products as Luden's cough drops and 
Rogaine to the anti-arthritis drug Celebrex. 
The merger, announced Monday, was reached by the boards of both companies Saturday and will give Pfizer, 
already the world's largest pharmaceutical company, greater dominance in the global market, with drugs aimed at 
treating an enormous sweep of ailments and illnesses. For Pfizer, the $60 billion stock purchase bolsters 
weaknesses in its own drug line-up with medicines for cancer and eye disease. Executives also hope it will give 
the company the wherewithal to pour more funds into finding the next blockbuster drug. 
The merger will create a new company with combined annual revenues of $48 billion and a research budget of 
more than $7 billion. Together the companies will have 11 per cent of the global pharmaceutical market. The 
closest competitor, GlaxoSmithKline, has 7.3 percent. 
"By combining with Pharmacia we are ensuring that our core capabilities in the discovery, development and 
commercialization of new medicines are strong around the world," said Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Henry 
McKinnell. 
Pfizer officials said Monday that it was too soon to say how the merger will affect the thousands of employees at 
the Global Research and Development facility in New London and Pfizer's Groton Laboratories, who were taken 
by surprise on learning about the merger, the company's second in as many years. In June of 2000, Pfizer 
acquired Warner Lambert for $115 billion, one of the largest mergers in history. 
Employees at the Groton-New London campus received e-mails Monday from McKinnell and Pharmacia head 
Fred Hassan informing them about the merger. 
"I wasn't so sure about it at first," said Pfizer utilities electrician Joseph P. Schick Jr., "but I feel more comfortable 
now." 
"I think the question was, 'Why now?' when we haven't even settled in from the last merger, when we haven't 
even completed the work," Schick said. "That question got answered by the e-mail. It said we're trying to become 
the number one company in America and to do that we have to be aggressive." 
Peter Goodwin, a retired cancer researcher for Pfizer who heard the news Monday afternoon, said, "It was a 
well-kept secret, but now you'll be able to buy Viagra and Rogaine from the same company." 
Executives say they anticipate Pfizer and Pharmacia to combine at the end of this year, or early next year. 
When that happens, the best-selling drug in the world, Pfizer's Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering medication, Viagra 
and Zoloft will be under the same roof with Pharmacia's Celebrex, a medication for arthritis; Detrol, used to treat 
incontinence; and Xanax, an anti-anxiety medication. Over-the-counter and pharmacy products like Pfizer's 
Listerine and Visine, will have the same parent as Pharmacia's Kaopectate, Cortaid, Rogaine and Nicorette. 
"This is Day One of the announcement of a deal that won't close until late this year or early next year," said Pfizer 
spokesman Stephen Lederer. "Right now, we're two companies. We're still competing." 
Although the companies are still two entities, Pfizer has worked with Pharmacia to market Celebrex and its 
follow-up drug, Bextra, which launched this spring. 
"There are a whole lot of steps to be taken," added Lederer. "It would be crazy to start speculating on the details. 
There will obviously be the huge job of combining and integrating."

Page 45 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Lederer said, however, that he did not foresee the Groton-New London operations being greatly affected. "We're 
very proud of what goes on in Connecticut," he said. 
Senior Vice President of Science and Technology Peter Corr, who heads Pfizer's research and development, was 
one of three people at the Groton-New London campus who worked on the merger. 
"It involved a very small number of people until it was signed and sealed," Corr said. 
Corr explained that the two companies started the formal process of considering each other for a merger in early 
July, though discussions between executives had been under way since April. 
"It was quite intense," Corr said of the process. "It was very cordial, open and honest." 
Corr came to Pfizer from Warner Lambert in June 2000, when Pfizer took over the corporation. Before that, he 
had been at G.D. Searle & Co., a division of Pharmacia. 
"As we look at it now, Pharmacia's pipeline is quite complementary to ours," Corr said. "Going forward we have 
to address the combination of the two, and once closure occurs, we'll have to make very rapid defined decisions 
after that." 
Corr said there are several medicines in Pharmacia's lineup that Pfizer executives are excited about, including 
eplerenone, a hypertension drug already submitted for government approval here and in Japan, as well as 
medicines to treat asthma and therapies for breast cancer. 
Corr said he anticipates the merger to impact the Groton-New London campus "very positively." 
Analysts said Monday they don't anticipate antitrust concerns, because the companies have very few overlapping 
product lines. Still, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said his office would be looking into the 
matter. 
"We will closely investigate and scrutinize this merger to ensure that competition is preserved, consistent with our 
state anti-trust laws," Blumenthal said. "Our analysis will be conducted on a market sector basis, drug by drug, to 
safeguard against a concentration of market power for any particular class of medicine by the new merged 
company. Consumers should have the benefits of more affordable medicine, particularly generic drugs." 
Executives at Pfizer noted Monday, however, that the patents of many medicines in the combined company's 
inventory would not expire for many years. The merger would help Pfizer sustain growth because 11 of the 
combined company's 12 blockbuster drugs will be protected until 2010. 
Also Monday, Pfizer announced a growth in its second-quarter earnings, reporting $1.96 billion in earnings, or 32 
cents per share, compared with $1.83 billion, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue in the second quarter 
reached $8.033 billion, compared to $7.622 billion last year. 
Under the deal announced Monday, Pharmacia shareholders would receive 1.4 shares of Pfizer stock for each 
share of Pharmacia. 
Both companies said Monday that the merger would provide $2.5 billion in cost savings by 2005, an important 
benefit at a time when drug companies are finding it harder to produce new blockbuster medicines and are under 
growing pressure to hold down prices. 
Pfizer executives said that the company has experienced $1.8 billion in cost savings for the year as a result of its 
merger with Warner-Lambert.

Pfizer Had a Long Road to Woo, Win Pharmacia 
Pfizer Had a Long Road to Woo, Win Pharmacia

Pfizer Inc. wooed Pharmacia Corp. for a year and a half before winning it over with its $53.38 billion all-stock 
offer over the weekend. 
Scarcely six months after the Warner-Lambert Co. deal closed in June 2000, Henry McKinnell, Pfizer's chairman 
and chief executive, was already sizing up his next move. From the start, he had his eye on Pharmacia closest of 
all, he said yesterday. 
The main allure: the success of Celebrex, the blockbuster arthritis medicine the companies market together, and 
Pharmacia's cancer franchise, something Pfizer has been unable to build from scratch after 10 years of trying. 
For more than a year and half, Mr. McKinnell floated various ideas about a deeper combination between the two 
companies with his counterpart Fred Hassan at Pharmacia. 
Eplerenone, a Pharmacia blood-pressure drug awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval, provided a 
catalyst for the most recent round of talks because it dovetails with Pfizer's Lipitor, for cholesterol, and Norvasc, 
another blood-pressure remedy, and Pharmacia will need a hand selling it, Mr. McKinnell said. 
Today, the companies confirmed the terms of the deal, a result of sporadic but ultimately intense negotiations. 
Executives at both firms were uncertain how investors would react and braced for the market open. The market 
punished Pfizer, sending its shares down $3.42, or 11% to $28.78, while Pharmacia shares climbed $6.66, or 
20%, to $39.25, at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, on a bearish day where few stocks 
were spared. 
With its offer for Pharmacia, Pfizer made clear that it hadn't inoculated itself against the problems that plague the 
entire pharmaceuticals industry just by buying Warner-Lambert. Pfizer, like its rivals, faces growing pressure on 
prices in markets around the world, and a slowdown in the introduction of new medicines. 
Indeed, Pfizer released second-quarter earnings yesterday, two days earlier than previously scheduled, and the 
results revealed slight weakness, though they were in line with expectations. Pfizer said net income rose 7% to 
$1.96 billion, or 32 cents a share, from $1.83 billion, or 29 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue increased 7% to 
$8.03 billion. 
Pfizer executives said the next quarter would be tough but a strong fourth quarter would allow the company to 
meet double-digit revenue and earnings growth targets for the year. "Our history is that we make our numbers," 
Mr. McKinnell told analysts in a conference call. "We just never seem to make them the way we planned them." 
If the Pharmacia acquisition is completed by year end, Pfizer will have bought several years of breathing room 
with cost savings expected to total $2.5 billion, new products, and a chance to reinvigorate the Pharmacia 
franchise of arthritis drugs that includes Celebrex and Bextra. 
Early talks between the companies were informal. Mr. McKinnell and Mr. Hassan, who have known each other for 
a decade, saw each other often at meetings of the drug industry's main trade group, known as PhRMA. Earlier 
this year, Mr. Hassan succeeded Mr. McKinnell as chairman and chief executive of PhRMA. 
Mr. McKinnell kept pestering Mr. Hassan about a deal. And Mr. Hassan kept putting him off. 
The turning point came in early April, when they were both at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta to 
prepare 5,000 sales representatives from both companies for the launch of Bextra, an arthritis drug that is 
expected to succeed blockbuster Celebrex.

"It looks like we ought to get more serious," Mr. McKinnell said to Mr. Hassan during a five-minute conversation 
after both men had addressed the group. "No," Mr. Hassan responded quickly and unequivocally. "We were still 
committed to going it alone," he recalled yesterday. 
Nevertheless, both executives re-examined the potential benefits of linking up afterward. "Independently, we 
came to the conclusion this would be a great combination," Mr. McKinnell said. 
More serious but still preliminary discussions got rolling in late May. Last month at a midtown New York hotel, 
executives from both companies quickly agreed on structure and management issues. They remained far apart, 
however, on price. Pfizer was discussing a share ratio of between 1.2 to 1.3 shares of its stock for each 
Pharmacia share, while Pharmacia demanded 1.4. 
By late June the talks stalled, and Pharmacia prepared to walk away. Just before the July Fourth weekend, 
however, Pfizer upped its offer to between 1.3 and 1.4, according to people familiar with the situation. "That was 
the breakthrough," said one person who was there. 
Due diligence began on July 2, Mr. McKinnell said. On July Fourth, teams of bankers, lawyers, accountants and 
corporate executives converged at the Intercontinental Hotel in New York and worked round the clock for a week. 
In recognition of current fears of hidden accounting blow-ups, Pfizer pored over Pharmacia's books and picked 
through its research pipeline. The Pharmacia team rigorously examined Pfizer, too. "This was due diligence like 
I've never seen it before," said one person close to the talks. 
By last Friday, the two teams presented the deal to the boards. While Pfizer's board supported the deal, at least 
two members of Pharmacia's board were initially reluctant to sell the company at such a low share price because 
of its recent highs. 
"There were some members of the board who said `Why should we sell at 30 if the stock's eventually going to 
come back,'" said one person close to the situation. 
Eventually, Mr. Hassan convinced his board that because the deal would be done with Pfizer stock, the combined 
companies' value would likely appreciate. 
Indeed, this deal is notable because it lacks a "collar" -- a mechanism for changing the ratios of stock if the shares 
of one or both of the companies swing wildly out of the expected range. People close to the situation said 
Pharmacia initially demanded a collar, but Pfizer refused. During the negotiations, Pfizer eventually raised its 
offer high enough to make Pharmacia comfortable without that protection. 
Still, the falling share price of Pfizer today could give Pharmacia investors pause in supporting the deal.

The Drug Behind the Deal --- Pfizer-Pharmacia Deal Means You'll Hear More of Celebrex, But Aspirin May Be Better 
The Drug Behind the Deal --- Pfizer-Pharmacia Deal Means You'll Hear More of Celebrex, But Aspirin May

FOR PATIENTS, the $53 billion merger that would join Pfizer Inc. with Pharmacia Inc. means you will be hearing 
more pitches for a powerful but controversial pain drug. 
Celebrex, the blockbuster arthritis pill, is at the center of the deal, and consequently Pfizer is likely to move 
quickly to try to enhance the medicine's status as the top-selling pain-killer and seventh-most popular prescription 
drug. Specifically, says Henry McKinnell, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive, the company will press more 
aggressively what he believes is the drug's major advantage over its biggest competitor, Merck & Co.'s Vioxx: 
Celebrex hasn't been linked to a risk of any heart problems, while the Merck pill has. 
That could mean patients will see a wave of new direct-to-consumer print and television advertising, a strategy 
that has helped propel Celebrex to the ranks of top-selling drugs world-wide, with some 34 million people taking it 
since it first came to market three years ago. Pfizer may also focus marketing efforts on doctors. 
But both Celebrex and Vioxx, members of a class of drugs called COX-2 inhibitors, have a number of critics. 
Questions have been raised about their safety and risks, and some people believe that most patients would fare 
just as well with much cheaper generic pills -- including aspirin and ibuprofen -- known as NSAIDs, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs. 
An 8,000 patient study failed to prove that Celebrex, with an average wholesale price of $2.20 per 200 milligram 
tablet, was better when it comes to stomach side effects than a common NSAID called diclofenac, which sells for 
pennies a pill. As a result, the Food and Drug Administration won't allow the company to market the pill as a safer 
alternative to generic medicines. 
"We didn't get a clear win," Mr. McKinnell acknowledges. 
Since neither Celebrex nor Vioxx have proven any better at relieving pain than generic painkillers, the main 
reason for taking them would be to avoid the side effects of the older, cheaper anti-inflammatories. Consequently, 
Mr. McKinnell says Pfizer aims to demonstrate -- possibly including another trial -- that Celebrex has a better 
safety profile than NSAIDs, which have been found to cause annoying and occasionally severe stomach 
problems, such as ulcers, in a minority of patients who use them. 
The debate over generics and the recent approval of Bextra, a new COX-2 drug from the Pfizer-Pharmacia team, 
have led many Wall Street analysts to conclude that Celebrex sales are near their peak. Nonetheless, Mr. 
McKinnell was already hammering away at Celebrex's virtues yesterday, echoing a strategy Pfizer used with 
another acquired blockbuster, the cholesterol-lowering Lipitor. 
"We have to communicate that cardiovascular safety is a critical differentiation between Celebrex and Vioxx," he 
said in an interview. 
In response, a spokesman for Merck said that Vioxx has fewer stomach-related side effects than Celebrex or the 
generic pain remedies. Vioxx "demonstrates a superior gastro-intestinal benefit," he said. 
Pfizer and Pharmacia already co-market Celebrex with enormous success. It racked up sales of $3.1 billion last 
year. In a further effort to boost sales, Pfizer and Pharmacia have already laid out an aggressive research 
program to continue to develop the Celebrex not only for pain, but for cancer and other conditions. They are 
certain to devote a portion of their combined $7 billion in annual research spending to studies intended to expand 
its market.

Already, a small study presented in May showed Celebrex improved the outcome for lung cancer patients when 
given as a "pretreatment" before chemotherapy and surgery. As a result, the company plans to launch a larger 
trial in lung-cancer patients, one of about 100 trials on the drawing boards for using Celebrex in cancer. Another 
major effort is in prevention of colon cancer; the drug is already approved as a preventive treatment in patients 
with a precursor to a rare form of inherited colon cancer. 
For the longer term, the company is also investigating the drug's potential as a treatment for such problems as 
atherosclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and migraine headaches. In each of 
these conditions, the COX-2 enzyme, the drug's principal target, is present in unusually high amounts-raising the 
possibility that blocking the enzyme might be an effective treatment strategy.

NEW YORK -- Pfizer Inc. added to its formidable strengths as the pharmaceutical industry's leader with a 
$60-billion (U.S.) acquisition of Pharmacia Corp. yesterday, pressuring its competitors toward similar mergers at 
a time of slimmer profits and angry consumers. 
The all-stock deal will create a pharmaceutical powerhouse with over $48-billion in revenues and a research 
budget of more than $7-billion. 
Pfizer is already the world's largest drug company when measured by the overall value of its stock. 
The merger combines Pfizer's widely recognized prowess for marketing with Pharmacia's drugs in the areas of 
oncology and ophthalmology, where Pfizer does not have a strong presence. 
The companies said the merger should provide $2.5-billion in cost saving by 2005, a particularly important point 
at a time when drug companies are finding it harder to produce new blockbuster medicines and are under 
growing public and government pressure to hold down prices. 
"That this brings cost-savings is obvious," said Pfizer chief executive officer Henry McKinnell. 
"But it creates a company that can grow more than the two companies could separately. It also significantly 
eliminates risk by expanding the product and market areas of the company." 
Pfizer manufactures blockbusters such as cholesterol-lowering agent Lipitor and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, 
while Pharmacia makes the cancer drug Camptosar as well as Rogaine hair products and the Nicorette smoking 
cessation line. 
The companies already jointly market pain reliever Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra. 
The two drugs have already been outpacing new prescriptions of the competing product Vioxx, made by Merck & 
Co. 
The deal spells even more trouble for Merck, which has said its 2002 earnings will be flat because of patent 
expirations and slowing Vioxx sales. 
"It puts Merck at a disadvantage because you are going to see an even more unified approach to marketing the 
Celebrex and Bextra," said Tim Anderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities. 
Merck has said it wants to remain independent, but analysts said in this environment it may not have a choice. 
Combinations of patent expirations, drug delays and manufacturing issues have cast a pall over most drug 
companies. 
Some, like Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Schering-Plough Corp., are considered especially troubled and could 
become targets for acquisition if their stocks continue to slide.

Page 52 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Some analysts have suggested that Bristol-Myers' experience in cancer and cardiovascular drugs may 
complement GlaxoSmithKline's competence in areas like anti-infection drugs. Merck and Schering could be a 
good fit because they are already jointly developing a cholesterol-lowering agent. 
European players such as Novartis AG and Aventis SA are considered purchasers so they can expand their 
presence in the United States. 
"Mergers may not lead to more better products, but if the companies don't do them they will be far worse off," said 
independent analyst Hemant Shah. As drug revenues slide, companies have even less money to put into 
research and development to create the products that will revive sales. 
By cutting costs they can generate some savings that can be applied to research, Mr. Shah said. 
Moreover, bigger companies with more products have more power with states and insurance companies that are 
increasingly balking at rising drug prices. 
Many states and insurance companies are using their bargaining power, creating preferred drug lists based in 
part on pharmaceutical companies' willingness to agree to a reduced price. 
Under the deal, Pharmacia shareholders would receive 1.4 shares of Pfizer stock for each share in Pharmacia. 
That represents $45.08 worth of stock based on Friday's closing Pfizer price and is a 36-per-cent premium over 
Pharmacia's closing price of $32.59 a share on Friday. 
Yesterday, Pharmacia shares were up $7.32, or 22 per cent, to $39.82 a share. The stock was that high three 
weeks ago but analysts said given the market conditions, the price Pfizer is paying is fair if not spectacular.

Viagra owner's (pounds) 38.7bn deal will force pace of consolidation.

Pressure mounts on competitors in wake of purchase of Pharmacia 
PFIZER, the US drug company which owns Viagra, yesterday cemented its position as the biggest 
pharmaceutical com-pany in the world by agreeing to acquire Swedish-based Pharmacia for (pounds) 38.7bn 
($60bn). 
The group will have combined annual revenues for 2002 of approximately (pounds) 31bn, with a research and 
development (R&D) budget for 2002 of (pounds) 4.5bn. That puts it way ahead of nearest competitor 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which generates sales of (pounds) 20bn. 
It is expected to generate peak year synergies of (pounds) 1.6bn by 2005. The acquisition gives the combined 
business a global market share of 11%, up from 7%, analysts estimated. 
The move will pile the pressure on others in the sector to follow suit. But analysts said there were few other 
potential matches that were as attractive. 
As a result of the deal, Pfizer, which is already the leading pharmaceutical company in the US and Canada, will 
move from fourth to first in Europe, from third to first in Japan, and from fifth to first in Latin America in 
pharmaceutical sales. 
Michael King, analyst at WestLB Panmure, said: "There has been speculation recently that the industry will need 
to consolidate further, given the pressures it currently faces, but not all are convinced that these large 
corporations provide the best climate for R&D innovation." 
The City is now likely to turn its attention to competitors such as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and AstraZeneca to 
clarify their own acquisition strategy. Commentators have long speculated on the benefits of merging the two 
London-listed giants. King said there would be significant cost savings from any union. 
The City views GSK, Merck and Novartis as the most likely acquirers in any further round of sector consolidation, 
while potential prey include Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), Wyeth and Schering Plough. 
The three potential candidates for acquisition all have problems, though; Wyeth has questions hanging over its 
accounting, Schering has manufacturing problems, and BMS has inven-tory problems. In addition, BMS and 
Wyeth have weak pipelines and BMS and Schering have patent expirations looming. 
Most analysts agreed Pfizer was acquiring one of the few global pharmaceutical companies expected to show 
good growth over the next couple of years, as well as fairly risk-free growth. 
The firms also said there was very little overlap between their businesses. 
Pfizer already co-promotes arthritis drug Celebrex with Pharmacia - it generated sales of (pounds) 2bn last year 
and analysts said the deal was one way of taking full control of this blockbuster, in the same way as acquiring 
Warner Lambert meant securing the rights for Lipitor, the world's best selling drug, with sales last year of 
(pounds) 4.2bn. 
One analyst at Gerrard said: "Whilst the link-up makes a lot of sense from a number of angles, any other deals 
are going to be much more defensive in nature." 
GSK has also been tipped to be looking at BMS, but its stock was dumped by traders as a result of the 
speculation.

Page 54 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The Gerrard analyst added: "The market is aware of the fact there are now limited options for GSK and 
AstraZeneca on the acquisition front." 
Pharmacia announced it intends to proceed with its previously announced spin-off of its remaining 84% 
ownership of Monsanto to its current shareholders. 
After hiving off Monsanto, Pfizer will exchange 1.4 shares of Pfizer stock for each outstanding share of 
Pharmacia stock. It gives Pfizer share-holders 77% of the combined firm and Pharmacia's share-holders 23%. 
The transaction is expected to close by the end of this year. 
Henry McKinnell, the executive chairman of Pfizer, will retain his role, while Pharmacia's executive chairman 
Fred Huggan is to become vice-chairman.

Pfizer raises merger bar in drug sector pressure: To buy Pharmacia: 'Very serious competition threat to others'

Pfizer raises merger bar in drug sector pressure: To buy Pharmacia: 'Very serious competition threat to 
others'

WASHINGTON - Ignoring the turmoil in stock markets, Pfizer Inc., the world's largest drug company, is buying 
rival Pharmacia Corp. for US$52-billion in shares to give it a global lock on some of the most lucrative 
prescription drugs now available. 
Pfizer of New York plans to add some of Pharmacia's top sellers such as Celebex, the popular arthritis drug, 
Rogaine hair products and Nicorette smoking treatment to its long list of top-selling prescription drugs including 
Viagra, the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor and Zoloft, an anti-de. 
"By combining with Pharmacia, we are ensuring that our core capabilities in the discovery, development and 
commercialization of new medicines are strong around the world," said Henry McKinnell, Pfizer's chairman and 
chief executive . 
If approved by anti-trust regulators, the Pfizer-Pharmacia merger will put pressure on other pharmaceutical 
companies such as its nearest rival, GlaxoSmithKline PLC of Britain, as well as as Merck & Co. and Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Co. to look for their own merger partners just to compete. 
"It will be a very serious competitive threat to others," said Martin Hall, head of pharmaceuticals research at 
HSBC Securities in London. "The question now is whether companies like Glaxo, Merck & Co., and Bristol-Myers 
are forced to do something themselves because of the threat." 
Fred Hassan, chairman and chief executive of Pharmacia, said the deal "is a strategic opportunity that 
immediately creates a global pharmaceutical company with unsurpassed resources and capabilities." The 
proposed new company would have combined annual revenue of US$48-billion and a R&D budget of more than 
US$7-billion. 
Pharmaceutical companies, already hard hit by the sharp downturn in the stock market and some recent drug 
flops, are under pressure from the U.S. government to producer lower-cost drugs. In addition, they face 
increasing competition from producers of generic versions of their top-selling drugs now that patents are expiring. 
The Standard & Poor's Pharmaceutical Index has fallen 28% this year on investor concern that drugmakers have 
few new products to replace those losing patent protection. 
Pfizer has produced few of its own new drugs in recent years and would get from Pharmacia several key drugs 
that still have 13 years of patent protection, as well as Pharmacia's new cancer drug, Camptosar. Pharmacia 
also generates about US$3-billion from its Celebrex and Bextra arthritis drugs. 
"Pharmacia was probably the most attractive property out there, based on the life expectancy of their products," 
said Mark Hesse-Withbroe, a health-care analyst at Victory Capital Management. "There aren't a lot of 
blockbusters coming out of the gate right now, so this tides Pfizer over and gives them some growth." 
However, nothing much was pleasing investors yesterday. Pfizer's shares fell , US$3.42, or 11%, in their biggest 
drop in 15 years to close at US$28.78 after it said it would offer 1.4 of its shares for each of Pharmacia's. That is 
a 36% premium over Pharmacia's Friday's close of US$35.09. Pharmacia' shares rose US$6.66, or 20%, to 
close at US$39.25.

This takeover route is a familiar one for Pfizer which became an industry leader after its US$115-billion 
acquisition of Warner-Lampbert which produces Lipitor. Pfizer has about 90,000 employees while Pharmacia, 
creating through a merger of Pharmacia of Sweden and Upjohn Co., has 59,000 employees in more than 60 
countries.

Pfizer buying Pharmacia in $60B stock deal to expand its dominance in market

NEW YORK (AP) _ Pfizer Inc. added to its formidable strengths as the pharmaceutical industry's leader with a 
$60-billion-US acquisition of Pharmacia Corp. on Monday, pressuring its competitors toward similar mergers at a 
time of slimmer profits and angry consumers. 
The all-stock deal will create a pharmaceutical powerhouse with over $48 billion US in revenues and a research 
budget of more than $7 billion. Pfizer is already the world's largest drug company when measured by the overall 
value of its stock. 
The merger combined Pfizer's widely recognized prowess for marketing with Pharmacia's drugs in the areas of

growing public and government pressure to hold down prices. 
``That this brings cost-savings is obvious,'' said Pfizer chief executive Henry McKinnell. ``But it creates a

Combinations of patent expirations, drug delays and manufacturing issues have cast a pall over most drug 
companies. Some, like Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Schering-Plough Corp., are considered especially troubled 
and could become targets for acquisition if their stocks continue to slide. 
``Bristol may not look good at $60, but it is a different picture at $20,'' said independent analyst Hemant Shah. 
Some analysts have suggested that Bristol-Myers' experience in cancer and cardiovascular drugs may

agree to a reduced price.

The drug companies have less bargaining power: Even combined, Pfizer and Pharmacia will have about 13 per 
cent of the U.S. market for pharmaceuticals. 
As drug companies merge, they will need more drugs to sustain them. 
``After the consolidation of the industry is done, overall earnings growth will slow,'' Shah said. 
Pfizer is no stranger to mergers. It was able to squeeze $1.8 billion US in savings from its hostile takeover of 
Warner-Lambert in 2000. 
In the short term, the deal will smooth over Pfizer's earnings when some drugs' patents expire. Antifungal agent 
Diflucan is set to lose market exclusivity in 2004 followed by depression drug Zoloft in 2005. Over the course of 
2003 and 2004, Pharmacia is slated to introduce new drugs for hypertension, anxiety, arthritis and pulmonary 
disease. 
``It is a good fit for both companies,'' said Banc of America analyst Len Yaffe. ``And it should be interesting to 
watch what the other companies do.'' 
Under the deal, Pharmacia shareholders would receive 1.4 shares of Pfizer stock for each share in Pharmacia. 
That represents $45.08 US worth of stock based on Friday's closing Pfizer price and is a 36 per cent premium 
over Pharmacia's closing price of $32.59 a share on Friday. 
On Monday, Pharmacia shares were up $7.32, or 22 percent, to $39.82 US a share. The stock was that high 
three weeks ago but analysts said given the market conditions, the price Pfizer is paying is fair if not spectacular. 
Spokesmen for Pfizer Canada and Pharmacia Canada said it's too early to tell what the merger will mean for 
their combined 2,950 employees, based mostly in the Toronto area and in Montreal.

DRUG giant Pfizer Inc has agreed to buy rival Pharmacia Corp for $US60 billion ($A107 billion) in a deal that will 
create the world's largest pharmaceutical company, according to US media reports. 
The proposed merger would create a US company with $US48 billion in revenue and a 
research-and-development budget of more than $US7 billion. 
New York-based Pfizer is already one of the world's biggest drug makers, with a range of high-profile products 
including anti-impotence drug Viagra. 
New Jersey-based Pharmacia's major prescription drug is the arthritis medication Celebrex. 
Under the deal, Pharmacia shareholders would receive 1.4 shares of Pfizer stock for each share in Pharmacia - 
a 36 per cent premium over the company's Friday closing price of $US45.08, according to reports by The New 
York Times and The Wall Street Journal. 
In return Pfizer shareholders will control 77 per cent of the new entity while its chairman and chief executive, 
Henry McKinnell, will keep his job. 
Pharmacia's chairman and chief, Fred Huggan, will become vice-chairman. 
The deal comes at an unusual time for both the international drug sector and overall global stockmarket. 
Pharmaceutical companies are faced with several obstacles, including competition from generic drugs, pressure 
on prices from the US federal Government and a growing number of patents that are expiring. 
Their stock prices have fallen in recent weeks along with the rest of the market as distrust in corporate America 
grows almost daily. 
The proposed Pfizer and Pharmacia deal, while breathtaking, would not represent the biggest merger in 
American corporate history. 
That title belongs to media giants Time Warner and America Online, which got together in a $US117.8 billion deal 
more than two years ago. 
Other mega-mergers include oil giant Exxon's purchase of Mobil in November 1999 for $US85.26 billion and 
Chevron's $US45.4 billion merger with Texaco in October 2000. 
Earlier this year computer giants Hewlett Packard and Compaq merged in a $US18.7 billion deal.

PFIZER TO BUY PHARMACIA IN $60 BILLION STOCK DEAL

NEW YORK -- Pfizer Inc. announced Monday that it is buying Pharmacia Corp. for $60 billion in a deal that would 
give the world's biggest drug company a medicine chest full of treatments for baby-boomer ills like baldness, 
arthritis, impotence and high cholesterol. 
The all-stock deal continues the trend toward consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry, which is scrambling to 
produce new blockbuster medicines while coming under growing public and government pressure to hold down 
drug prices. 
"That this brings cost savings is obvious," Pfizer chief executive Henry McKinnell said. "But it creates a company 
that can grow more than the two companies could separately." 
The new company would have annual revenue of $48 billion and a research-and-development budget of more 
than $7 billion. It would combine Pfizer's marketing prowess with Pharmacia's eye care and cancer drugs, 
treatments where Pfizer is not strong. 
Pfizer already has a lineup that includes Lipitor (high cholesterol), Viagra (impotence) and Zoloft (depression), 
and its over-the-counter products include Listerine mouthwash and Visine eye drops. 
Pharmacia's major drug is the arthritis medication Celebrex. It also makes Rogaine for hair loss, Nicorette 
stop-smoking products, the bladder-control drug Detrol, Luden's cough drops and the anti- diarrhea syrup 
Kaopectate. 
The companies said the merger should save $2.5 billion by 2005. 
The deal was approved by the boards of both companies. It still needs the OK from shareholders and regulators. 
The timing was a surprise, given the slump in the economy and the plummeting stock market. 
Pfizer stock fell $3.42, or 10.6 percent, to $28.78 in trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Pharmacia rose $6.66, or 20.4 percent, to $39.25. Under the deal, Pharmacia stockholders would receive 1.4 
shares of Pfizer for each share of Pharmacia. 
Analysts predicted the deal will prompt other mergers. 
"It is a good fit for both companies," said Banc of America analyst Len Yaffe. "And it should be interesting to 
watch what the other companies do." 
Drug companies are feeling pressure. States and insurance companies are increasingly balking at rising drug 
prices, and patents on lucrative older brands are expiring as generic drugs provide cheaper options for patients. 
With $26.3 billion in pharmaceutical sales, Pfizer is already the world's largest drug company when measured by 
the overall value of its stock. Together, Pfizer and Pharmacia will have about 13 percent of the U.S. market for 
pharmaceuticals. 
The two giants are themselves products of mergers. 
Pfizer, which is based in New York and has about 90,000 employees, acquired Warner-Lambert two years ago for 
$115 billion, gaining control of Lipitor.

Pharmacia, based in Peapack, N.J., was created through the merger of Pharmacia of Sweden and the Upjohn 
Co. The company has 59,000 employees in more than 60 countries. 
In the short term, the deal will smooth over Pfizer's earnings as patents expire for the antifungal agent Diflucan 
(2004) and Zoloft (2005). Pharmacia is expected to introduce new drugs for high blood pressure, anxiety, arthritis 
and pulmonary disease by 2004.

Corrections & Amplifications 
CADWALADER, WICKERSHAM & TAFT provided legal counsel to Pfizer Inc. in its agreement to buy Pharmacia 
Corp. A page-one article Tuesday incorrectly gave the law firm's name. 
In the world's biggest corporate combination in more than a year, Pfizer Inc. agreed to buy Pharmacia Corp. for 
stock valued at $60 billion, giving the world's biggest drug company full rights to one of the industry's crown 
jewels, the blockbuster arthritis drug Celebrex. 
The deal, announced Monday, would create an industry behemoth with more than $48 billion in revenue and a 
research-and-development budget of more than $7 billion. The combination would be the world's largest drug 
maker by far and the leading pharmaceuticals company by revenue in every major market around the globe. 
That any company would strike a deal amid the stock-market turbulence of recent months is surprising. Corporate 
accounting scandals, plunging share prices and economic uncertainty have made companies reluctant to strike 
bold "transformational" deals, while several big mergers -- such as the one that created AOL Time Warner Inc. -- 
have faced strong investor criticism. While the Pfizer-Pharmacia deal is seen as practical, it isn't clear how 
investors will react to such a large deal in the uncertain market environment. 
The deal comes amid unprecedented pressure on pharmaceuticals companies as the industry struggles with a 
dry spell in its research labs, fights rising competition from generics makers and wrestles with intense pressure on 
prices from governments and private buyers around the world. As a result, drug companies are facing slowing or 
declining revenue and are watching their stocks sink to their lowest level in years. 
Under terms of the deal, Pharmacia would proceed with its previously announced plans to spin off its remaining 
84% ownership of Monsanto Co. to its shareholders. After the spinoff, Pharmacia shareholders would receive 1.4 
shares of Pfizer stock for each share of Pharmacia, valuing Pharmacia stock at $45.08 per share, representing a 
44% premium over Pharmacia's average closing price for the past 30 days and adjusted for the Monsanto 
spinoff. The deal is expected to be tax-free for shareholders. 
In addition to the widely prescribed arthritis drug Celebrex, the transaction would join Pfizer's dominant 
cardiovascular franchise -- including the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor and the blood-pressure pill Norvasc, as 
well as its Zithromax antibiotic and its epilepsy medicine Neurontin -- with such popular Pharmacia drugs as 
Xalatan for glaucoma and the cancer drug Camptosar. 
People familiar with the transaction expect minimal antitrust problems because the companies have few 
overlapping products and because Pfizer's 8% global share of total pharmaceutical sales would rise only to about 
11% if the deal is completed. One potential antitrust roadblock could be in the area of urinary incontinence, where 
Detrol, Pharmacia's blockbuster-in-the-making, was poised to get competition from Pfizer's Darifenacin, which it 
expects to submit for U.S. regulatory approval this year. 
The Pfizer-Pharmacia deal is expected to heighten pressure for other U.S. companies to consider combinations, 
including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Merck & Co., which have been hard-hit by generic competition as their 
flagship medicines lose patent protection. 
Pfizer's move, largely the brainchild of Chief Executive Henry McKinnell, echoes its acquisition two years ago of 
another of its partners, Warner-Lambert, in a $115 billion deal that gave it full control over the cholesterol-lowering

drug Lipitor. In recent years, big mergers had fallen into disfavor with some industry executives, who note that 
companies that pursued that tack, such as GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Bristol-Myers, failed to solve their problems 
-- particularly in research -- and appeared to be distracted by the merger process. 
But Pfizer's acquisition of Warner-Lambert is considered one of the success stories to emerge from the raft of 
drug-industry combinations of the 1990s. In that case, Pfizer's acquisition was hostile, so it was free to unilaterally 
cut Warner-Lambert operations and personnel to make the operations meld smoothly. 
As in the Warner-Lambert deal, Pfizer is capturing a blockbuster drug, in this case Celebrex and its follow-on 
drug, Bextra, both of which it already markets with Pharmacia, which is based in New Jersey. Buying the 
company would give Pfizer full control over the Celebrex-Bextra arthritis franchise. The two drugs are expected to 
have combined sales of $3.75 billion this year. 
But growth would be a tall order, given the massive sales base of the new Pfizer. To still be considered a 
respectable growth company, Pfizer would have to come up with $5 billion or more in new revenue each year. 
During the past three years, Pfizer has struggled to find replacements for some of its aging blockbusters, 
launching only two new medicines on the U.S. market that were discovered by company researchers, a 
schizophrenia treatment called Geodon, with sales of just $150 million in 2001, and Vfend, an antifungal drug 
approved in May. Its last smash hit was Viagra, launched four years ago. 
Separately Monday, Pfizer reported a 7% rise in net income for the second quarter to $1.96 billion, or 32 cents a 
share, from $1.83 billion, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts were looking for earnings excluding items of 
39 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Revenue rose 5.4% to $8.03 billion from $7.62 
billion. 
Industry experts have long speculated about a deal between Pfizer and Pharmacia because of the good strategic 
fit. The two companies have had a partnership since 1998 to market Celebrex, the world's leading arthritis 
medicine and the No. 7 global drug overall, and they have continued that arrangement with Bextra, a 
second-generation medicine launched in the U.S. earlier this year. 
In Pharmacia, Pfizer is acquiring a relatively strong drug company, with four drugs that have $1 billion-plus sales 
or potential sales. That would add to Pfizer's eight drugs already at those sales levels. Moreover, Pharmacia's 
major drugs don't face any patent threats for years: Its cancer drug Camptosar is the closest to patent expiration, 
in 2007. 
Pharmacia said it expects per-share earnings to rise 15% to 17% in the second quarter. Analysts expect 
double-digit earnings-per-share gains for Pharmacia from 2003 through 2006. Pfizer has been looking to expand 
into the lucrative market for cancer drugs, one of Pharmacia's strengths, and it also picks up ophthalmology, 
where Pharmacia's glaucoma treatment Xalatan already is on the verge of $1 billion in annual sales. 
Pfizer also is getting Pharmacia's top executive, Fred Hassan, a rising star in the industry, in part because of his 
turnaround of Pharmacia, which was created through the merger of two weak drug makers, Pharmacia of 
Sweden and Upjohn Co. of the U.S. Mr. McKinnell, Pfizer's 59-year-old CEO, would be chief executive and 
chairman of the combined company. Mr. Hassan, 56, chairman and chief executive of Pharmacia, would become 
vice chairman of Pfizer and a member of the board, the only Pharmacia board member to sit on the combined 
drug maker's board. 
According to people familiar with the situation, the deal talks began earlier this year, when Mr. McKinnell 
approached Mr. Hassan after the two appeared at a meeting of both companies' sales forces in Atlanta to prepare 
for the Bextra launch. Mr. McKinnell broached the subject of an acquisition, and Mr. Hassan "was very receptive," 
according to a person close to the situation. 
The trading patterns of both stocks helped nurture the deal; their share prices have been trading roughly in 
tandem for months. In April, when Pfizer and Pharmacia first started their discussions, both stocks were trading 
above $40 a share. By summer, when the market swooned and accounting troubles started to infect the 
health-care industry, Pfizer and Pharmacia fell to the low 30s. With both share prices falling at roughly the same 
rate, the companies could negotiate a share ratio without worrying about one stock swinging wildly out of range. 
"It made it easier to hold discussions with the stocks trading in parallel, which is rather rare," said a person close 
to the discussions.

Monday morning the companies' stock prices took sharply different turns after the deal was announced. Shares in 
Pharmacia were up 16%, or $5.21, at $37.80 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, while Pfizer shares were 
down 16%, or $5.22, at $26.98 each on the NYSE. 
Pfizer shareholders would own about 77% of the company, with Pharmacia shareholders owning the rest. The 
deal, which is expected to close by year end, is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies and 
regulators. The deal isn't expected to dilute Pfizer's 2003 adjusted net income and to add about six cents a share 
to earnings in 2004. 
The deal is expected to allow the new Pfizer to cut costs, creating some breathing room to find new drugs. People 
familiar with the deal expect those savings to amount to $1.4 billion in 2003, with savings growing to $2.5 billion 
by 2006. As part of the deal, Pfizer is expected to reaffirm its double-digit revenue growth and diluted 
earnings-per-share growth of at least 15% a year for 2003 and 2004. 
The combined company would put even more distance between itself and its rivals in two of the most important 
parts of the drug business: sales and research. Pfizer expects to spend $5.2 billion on finding and developing 
drugs this year, already about 20% more than GlaxoSmithKline, the next biggest spender. Add in Pharmacia's 
$2.2 billion in research spending, and the combined company would have a research budget nearly one-third the 
size of that of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. 
In the war for drug sales, the expanded Pfizer would field 13,000 sales representatives in the U.S. alone, more 
than any other drug company. A person familiar with Pfizer's plans said the sales force could grow even larger to 
support new products in the works at both companies. 
The deal is expected to get tough scrutiny from antitrust enforcers given its size, according to people familiar with 
the situation. The transaction likely will be reviewed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, rather than the 
Justice Department, because of the agency's expertise in drug-industry mergers. The FTC is likely to do a 
market-by-market investigation of the two companies and could seek divestitures or compulsory licensing in areas 
where the two companies have a combined dominant market share. 
Lazard LLC and Bear Stearns & Co. advised Pfizer, while Goldman Sachs & Co. advised Pharmacia. 
Codwalader, Wickersham & Taft provided legal counsel to Pfizer, and Sullivan & Cromwell provided legal counsel 
to Pharmacia.

NEW YORK -- In a deal that is sure to shock investors, Pfizer is expected to announce today a $60 billion, 
all-stock deal to buy rival drug company Pharmacia, according to people close to the transaction. The deal would 
create the largest drug company in the world. 
The merger, the largest gamble by far this year, threatens to trigger a substantial fall in Pfizer's share price as 
investors question the logic of undertaking a takeover amid corporate accounting scandals, a sluggish economic 
recovery and a devastated stock market. 
Pfizer is expected to stress that the combination will create an industry leader with more than $48 billion in 
revenue and a $7 billion research war chest. Pfizer, which boasts cholesterol drug Lipitor, also gets claim to 
Pharmacia's blockbuster arthritis drug Celebrex and glaucoma treatment Xalatan. 
Pharmaceutical firms have been under rising pressure to merge as prices for top drugs fall under pressure from 
government regulation and generic drugmakers. 
The deal is expected to undergo a severe antitrust investigation in the USA and Europe. Regulators will be 
concerned that the combined company will dominate more than 10% of global drug sales. 
Should the deal become successful, it could pave the way for another wave of pharmaceutical mergers. Wall 
Street analysts believe giants such as Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck are eager to do deals as their most 
lucrative medicines suffer from the expiration of patent protection. 
Pfizer and Pharmacia spokesmen could not be reached for comment. 
Employees may also be an obstacle. Pfizer has a reputation for being heavy-handed in cost-cutting, and many 
jobs could be lost. Savings are earmarked at $1.4 billion in 2003, with cost-cuts growing to $2.5 billion by 2006. 
Under terms of the deal, Pfizer will own about 77% of the combined company. The deal, which is expected to 
close by year-end, is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies. The deal isn't expected to dilute 
Pfizer's 2003 adjusted net income and could add about 6 cents a share to earnings in 2004. 
The high-risk acquisition by Pfizer CEO Henry McKinnell comes after his largely successful takeover of rival 
Warner-Lambert two years ago in a $115 billion deal. In that deal, Pfizer gained full control over 
cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor. Nevertheless, megamergers have fallen out of favor in recent months. Many 
industry executives point to the failures of integration underscored by mergers undertaken by GlaxoSmithKline 
and Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
Growing sales will be difficult for Pfizer-Pharmacia. Both companies suffer from aging blockbuster drugs that will 
soon be eclipsed by generic drugs. 
Pharmacia shares closed at $32.59, up 42 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading Friday. Pfizer closed 
down 40 cents to $32.20.

ALI VELSHI, CNNfn ANCHOR, STREET SWEEP: Drug maker Pfizer`s (URL: http://www.pfizer.com/) proposed 
acquisition of rival Pharmacia (URL; http://www.pnu.com/) began the day as an all-stock deal valued at $60 
billion. That`s a 38 percent premium for Pharmacia shareholders. 
But that was before investors reacted to the deal and lopped billions off of the price. Pfizer stock, as you can see, 
off $3.42 to a 52-week low. 
Pharmacia, nice gain, there 6.66, to 39.25. Despite the reception, Pfizer chairman and CEO Henry McKinnell 
said the deal is good for both firms. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
HENRY MCKINNELL, CHMN. & CEO, PFIZER: The ARBs (ph) are in. They are buying Pharmacia and selling 
Pfizer or shorting Pfizer to narrow the spread in the transaction. That will straighten itself out later this week. So in 
fact you`re looking at a wonderful buying opportunity. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
VELSHI: Joining us with her thoughts on the merger and the state of the merger and acquisitions market is Emily 
Burg of the publication "The Daily Deal." 
Emily, welcome. 
EMILY BURG, "THE DAILY DEAL": Nice to be here. 
VELSHI: This must have been a really regular gig for you talking about mergers and acquisitions in the heyday of 
the market highs a couple years ago. Are you coming back? Is this a regular stint now? 
BURG: I would like to think so but alas I don`t think that this merger heralds a change in the market sentiment 
towards deals at this point. There is so much going on, there are so many reasons to be concerned about what 
companies might have hidden on their books that companies need to be really careful. On top of that, there has 
been such an erosion in stock prices. We look at this deal today as a fantastic example. Companies need to be 
really careful when they evaluate whether or not they can afford to do a deal. The market is so hostile toward 
M&A right now that a deal price also needs to include the risk in seeing 2 to $3 billion lopped off your market cap 
when you... 
VELSHI: (INAUDIBLE). Here`s a question, though, Pfizer is one of the eight remaining triple-A rated companies 
that the S&P rates for their debt rating. It has cash and other companies have low-priced stock. In some ways 
doesn`t that create the ideal environment for mergers and acquisitions? 
BURG: Well, it should but we can`t rule out the other extraneous factors going on that have been totally shocking. 
We`re looking at all of these issues with corporate morality, corporate governance, with seeing the administration 
being forced to play a role in how companies operate and do their deals like we haven`t seen in many years. 
That`s been quite a change. You can`t count that out. It`s not just about the economics of the deal anymore. 
However, M&A still remains a very important corporate tool and I think that the right deals will have their place 
regardless of what goes on from a legal perspective or regulatory perspective or the market fluctuations. But we 
are not going to see a return to the blockbuster deals of `99 and 2000 any time soon. 
PATRICIA CHADWICK, PRES., RAVENGATE PARTNERS: One could say that in fact this deal is being done 
from a state of weakness rather than strength for the industry as a whole, that we`re watching drugs come off

Page 67 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
patent, that basically drug companies are under huge pressure about raising their prices. If you look outside to 10 
years you have to believe the prices of drugs are going to be coming down. Having said that, Pfizer did a pretty 
good with Warner-Lambert. They took that acquisition and made it into something for themselves. Now they have 
a marketing arrangement with Pharmacia on Celebrex. Do they have the opportunity to do the same thing with 
this deal? 
BURG: Well, there are two issues. Number one, Pfizer is in much better shape than a lot of its competitors, which 
is what`s a little bit unusual about this deal. All of the issues that you talked about are quite relevant for the sector. 
But Pfizer has been feeling the pressure a little less than the other players. In terms of what Celebrex and Bextra, 
which is the follow-on offering, can do, let`s not forget that last month Express Scripts (URL: 
http://www.express-scripts.com/) , which handles prescriptions for a lot of corporate health care programs, has 
discouraged physicians from writing prescriptions for these so-called "Cox-two (ph) inhibitors," saying that they 
might not be as beneficial as originally thought, and encouraging doctors to send their patients towards some 
over-the-counter remedies. So this might not be the drug boon that we had seen with the acquisition of Lipitor 
which came via the... 
CHADWICK: OK. So even if you didn`t have two great drugs coming together, this reminds me of what the oil 
companies did three or four years ago. The price of oil. 
VELSHI: When oil. 
(CROSSTALK) 
CHADWICK: was at 10 bucks. And they said goodness, we can`t make money at this level, we merge ourselves 
together and the. 
VELSHI: Operating efficiencies. 
CHADWICK: Right. You cut your sales force in half, you cut your R&D. Can it work on that level? 
BURG: It`s a perfect analogy because of the cost of exploration for unproven reserves in the oil sector versus the 
cost of drug development and R&D. It`s much easier to buy something that is proven, that has already gotten its 
FDA regulation approval and is out there on the market. That`s a much safer guarantee than - nobody knows how 
many millions of dollars you`re going to have to put forth to develop whatever the next Viagra or the next new 
blockbuster drug is going to be. 
VELSHI: Final question for you. All those folks who used to make money off of this, the investment bankers 
hoping for that return to merger and acquisition activities, what do those brokerage houses who have investment 
arms do? I`ve got about 30 seconds, but what do they do now if the world is not coming back to mergers and 
acquisitions? 
BURG: They are finding ways to keep themselves busy, particularly in their bankruptcy practices that you were 
talking about earlier with the debtor and (ph) possession financing for WorldCom (URL: 
http://www.worldcom.com/) . People are sitting there waiting for this biggest bankruptcy to be announced. So any 
kind of distress M&A, which we`ve seen a lot of over the past year, will continue. 
VELSHI: Emily Burg, thank you very much. 
BURG: Nice to be here. 
VELSHI: Emily Burg is the senior editor at "The Daily Deal." Patricia Chadwick, thank you very much.

Pfizer and Pharmacia set for £37bn merger. 
Pfizer and Pharmacia set for £37bn merger.

WORLD stock markets are expected to get a muchneeded shot in the arm today when drugs giant Pfizer reveals 
plans to create the world's biggest pharmaceutical company by acquiring rival Pharmacia for $60 billion ( £37 
billion). 
The combined group will boast annual revenue of more than $48 billion as Pfizer's Viagra and anticholesterol 
drug Lipitor are brought under the same umbrella as Pharmacia's topselling arthritis treatments such as Celebrex 
and Bextra. 
Analysts said the planned merger, which was widely reported in US newspapers overnight, would make Pfizer the 
number one drug company in Europe, Japan and Latin America, a position it already holds in the US. 
News on Wall Street of the all-paper deal is expected to provide some comfort for rattled investors at the start of a 
week in which fears of further corporate governance scandals are still set to dominate the agenda. 
The deal will see New York-based Pfizer offer 1.4 of its shares for every Pharmacia share, representing a 38% 
premium to Friday's closing price for the target company. 
Pfizer shareholders will emerge with 77% of the combined group and its execut i v e chairman Henry McKinnell 
will retain the same role in the merged entity. Pharmacia executive chairman Fred Huggan will be vice-chairman. 
The US reports said Pharmacia would proceed with plans to hive off its 84% stake in Monsanto, the controversial 
agricultural products group that has become synonymous with genetically-modified crops. 
The deal comes as the drugs industry continues to search for ways to cope with falling revenues, a wave of new 
products and fears about the validity of key patents. 
Pfizer has already played a leading role in the consolidation drive with the $114 billion acquisition of rival 
Warner-Lambert in 2000. It also revealed last month that it was pursuing options for the sale of its 
Schick-Wilkinson shaving business and its Adams confectionery operations. 
These could help fund a $10 billion share buyback. 
Unilever is seen as a prime candidate to acquire Schick while Nestl and Cadbury Schweppes are believed to be 
front runners for Adams. 
The sales will enable Pfizer to focus on pharmaceuticals and health care, where it has targeted much of its 
investment in new products and marketing.

PAUL KANGAS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: An amazing turnaround on Wall Street. After 
plummeting more than 430 points, the Dow ricochets back closing off just 45 points. The NASDAQ Index ends 
with a gain of 9 points. 
Good evening. I`m Paul Kangas. 
SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: And I`m Susie Gharib. 
A blockbuster $60 billion merger in the drug industry today. We`ll tell you why Pfizer (PFE) is buying Pharmacia 
(PHA). And we ask Pfizer`s chairman and CEO Henry McKinnell if the merger with Pharmacia is a prescription 
for growth. 
Good evening everyone. 
A dramatic sell off and a dramatic rebound on Wall Street today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more 
than 400 points, before a late day rally cut the loss to just 45 points. The NASDAQ even managed to eke out a 
small gain: 9 points. 
As Erika Miller reports, a variety of factors led to today`s roller coaster ride. 
ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: What started as a stampede of selling 
turned into a binge of late day buying. Blue chips managed to end the day with only a small loss after falling triple 
digits earlier in the session. Analysts` only explanation for the change in sentiment was bargain hunting, but they 
were sure of the root of the heavy midday selling 
JOSEPH MCALINDEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER ASSET MGMT.: 
Today, people are extremely worried about balance sheets, the quality of accounting numbers, and the integrity of 
the people running the companies. 
MILLER: Fanning those fears was word from congressional leaders that WorldCom`s (WCOME) accounting fraud 
began earlier than the company announced. Even a blockbuster merger between Pfizer and Pharmacia couldn`t 
get investors excited about stocks. The concern is that Pfizer is overpaying. 
MIKE KRENSAVAGE, PHARAMCEUTICAL ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES: There`s so much doom and gloom 
for the pharmaceutical industry right now. The stocks trade at say a 6 or 7 percent discount to the S&P 500, 
compared with a typical 20 to 25 percent premium, and people are really, really down on the drug companies. 
MILLER: Also weighing on the market is the sliding dollar, which makes U.S. assets less valuable. Today, the 
dollar fell below one euro for the first time in two years. 
LAURENCE CANTOR, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, J.P. MORGAN CHASE: Well it`s important just 
because it is a parity, and people he been talking about it and looking at that level. We haven`t been there since 
January of 2000, so it`s been quite a while. 
MILLER: The market`s declines came even as President Bush had reassuring words for investors. 
GEORGE W. BISH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want you to know that the economy, our economy, 
is fundamentally strong. This economy has got the foundations for growth so the people who want to find work, 
can find work, so the entrepreneurs in America can flourish.

Page 71 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
MILLER: It`s been a depressing two years for stock investors. The Dow is down 26 percent from its high, hit in 
January 2000. The NASDAQ has plunged 73 percent and the S&P 500 40 percent from their highs in March of 
that year. But some market experts predict major stock indexes could soon turn the corner. 
MCALINDEN: You are at a moment of capitulation now where investors are just throwing in the towel and these 
are the times when great opportunities tend to arise. I don`t know if it`s today or tomorrow, but I do believe it`s this 
summer and probably this month and maybe this week. 
MILLER: There could be some relief for investors tomorrow, when Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan testifies before 
the Senate Banking Committee. Some economists are hoping that he will restore confidence that the economy is 
on solid footing. 
Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. 
KANGAS: For more insight on today`s market moves, joining me now is Joe Battipaglia, chief investment 
strategist at Ryan, Beck & Company. 
And welcome back to the program, Joe. 
JOSEPH BATTIPAGLIA, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, RYAN, BECK & CO.: Good to see you, Paul. 
KANGAS: When you joined Ryan, Beck back a month ago, you were looking for the markets to go higher and 
they`ve done nothing but go the other direction. What are you telling your clients now? 
BATTIPAGLIA: We`ve had a month-and-a-half of distress in the markets not only worries about the economy but 
of course worries about corporate America and whether or not there`s true leadership to get us out of this morass. 
What we`re telling investors is that our analysis suggests that equities are cheap relatives to bonds and other 
asset classes. We don`t know where the bottoms are of course but we see value across the spectrum in equities. 
And so we`d stay with a diversified portfolio with a heavy weighting in health care and financial services. We`d be 
nibbling in technology. We want to be in the consumer sector. And we think that this situation will not last as the 
summer progresses, for the simple reason that the economy is expanding, profits are on the mend, the system is 
fundamentally sound, and investors will find value here and bid up prices aggressively as we move deep into the 
summer. 
KANGAS: This business about where is the bottom, Charlie Minter who runs Comstock Partners had an 
interesting thing on his Web site last week. He reminded us of the old saying that a watched pot never boils, 
meaning in this case that with so many looking for a bottom it`s not likely to happen, what do you say? 
BATTIPAGLIA: I say that`s right. In fact, on top of it all when it looks the darkest and there is indiscriminate selling 
and on big volume, I might add, that`s indeed the point where you get an inflection point. We have seen this time 
and time again with panics in `98 and panics prior to that point, even in 1987. And have seen that with the selling 
of Philip Morris (MO) and Coca-Cola (KO) along with electric utilities and the big blue chips after they`ve taken 
care of all the NASDAQ stocks and others like it. 
KANGAS: What about all of the uncertainty surrounding corporate accounting and the impact of corporate 
earnings, investor sentiment, when do we get positives in these areas? 
BATTIPAGLIA: Well, I think the first place you`ll find it is in second quarter earnings reports, why? that`s the 
chance for managements to not only talk about business conditions, but to reaffirm their standards, to come out 
against corporate shenanigans and to reassure their employees and investors that these companies in 
themselves will take care of these and take steps to avoid these problems in the future. 
KANGAS: What are you looking for tomorrow just on a short-term? 
BATTIPAGLIA: The market is going to anticipate that Alan Greenspan is going to have some very good things to 
say regarding the economy, perhaps he`ll talk about irrational depression in contrast to where we were in `96. But 
at the same time I think the market will have a strong opening, try and test a negative environment for a brief time 
and then rally strong through the rest of the day, setting us up for a very strong rally through the summer. 
KANGAS: Joe, we really appreciate your insights, thanks for being with us. 
BATTIPAGLIA: My pleasure. 
KANGAS: We have been speaking with Joe Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Ryan, Beck.

And let`s look at how the day developed. First of all, the blue chips headed lower for the sixth consecutive session 
on today`s opening as fear and gloom continued to dominate. Individual investors were dumping mutual funds 
and accounted for plenty of the selling of course. So the Dow Industrial Average spiraled steadily lower all 
morning long, and by 12:30 p.m., posted a 310-point, or 3.6 percent, loss. The NASDAQ Index was off a more 
modest 25 points, or 1.8 percent. Not even that upbeat speech by President Bush could nudge a hint of a 
rebound in the market and that caused sellers to become more aggressive in mid afternoon, sending the Dow to a 
440-point deficit shortly after 2:00 p.m. That downward spike finally attracted a flurry of buying by bargain hunters. 
And the rollicking rally that followed slashed the closing loss in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a mere 45.34 
points, putting it at 8639.19. The NASDAQ Index recovered from a 50-point drop and closed with a gain of 9.12, 
ending at 1382.62. Very impressive 
Big board volume impressive, too, 1.93 billion shares, well ahead of Friday`s pace, and almost twice as much 
down volume, however, than up volume. 
The Dow Transport Index off 46 1/3 points. 
Utilities managed to gain 3.84. 
The Closing Tick mildly bullish at +534. 
Standard & Poor`s 500 off 3 1/2. 
A 1 3/4-point drop in the 100. 
The MidCap 400 off nearly 3 1/2 points. 
The Futures Price Index was up 0.42. 
New York Stock Exchange Composite off nearly 3 3/4 points. 
About a 2 2/3 drop in the Value Line. 
Russell2000 Small Cap Index fell nearly 4 1/4 points. 
And the broadly-based Wilshire 5000 ending with a loss of 40.14. 
The bond market was holding its own for most of the session, thanks to flight to quality buying linked to the stock 
market sell-off. But when stocks snapped back, bonds sold off sharply, especially since Fed chief Greenspan is 
likely to strike a positive note on the economy tomorrow as he presents his semi-annual economic update to 
Congress. By the close then, tax free and corporates were in the red by an eighth to three-eighths of a point, and 
the Treasury market was down across the board. 
A loss of 8/32 in the 5-year note. 
The 10-year note down 14/32. 
The 30-year bond dropped 25/32. 
But the Lehman Brothers Long-Term Treasury Bond Index managed to edge up a quarter of a point. 
I`ll be back shortly to show you where the action was on Wall Street today. Susie? 
GHARIB: Paul, one of the losers today was Pfizer (PFE). Its shares tumbled 11 percent after the pharmaceutical 
giant announced plans to buy rival Pharmacia (PHA) for $60 billion. The mega deal got mixed reviews on Wall 
Street. Analysts were skeptical as to whether the combined company would achieve revenue and profit targets. 
Pfizer also announced second quarter earnings of $0.33 a share, a $0.01 better than expectations, although 
revenue fell short. 
Lehman analyst Tony Butler, who personally owns Pfizer stock, says there are several reasons the shares were 
down. 
ANTHONY BUTLER, PHARMACEUTICAL ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Investors are probably a little 
dyspeptic as a result of the premium Pfizer pays, 50 percent above Pharmacia`s closing price on Friday. 
Investors are also asking why now. And quite frankly the quarter that Pfizer just reported did not contain a lot of 
strength at the top line.

Page 73 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
GHARIB: I talked with Pfizer`s CEO earlier this afternoon and I began by asking Henry McKinnell how he plans 
to get double digit growth from a $50 billion company. 
HENRY MCKINNELL, CHAIRMAN & CEO, PFIZER: 
MCKINNELL: Well, quite frankly, growing a 50 billion company 10 percent a year is no more difficult, really, than 
growing a $5 billion company 10 percent a year. The answer is you have far more resources. You have more 
products, you have more capability. And in our case, we`re spending $7 billion to do that. 
GHARIB: But Mr. McKinnell, even Pfizer alone, without Pharmacia, and even other big drug companies haven`t 
grown at a rate of 10 percent. So how are you going to pull that off? 
MCKINNELL: We`ve actually grown at 15 percent during the last 10 years. This past year our earnings were up 
21 percent. If you look at our history we`ve exceed 15 percent growth per year over 75 years. 
GHARIB: And so where do you see as the driver for that growth? 
MCKINNELL: The driver of our growth going forward as a standalone company is products that are in the market 
with patent protection well into the end of this decade, 15 new drugs we expect to have with the FDA for approval 
over the next five years. And, of course, now with Pharmacia, we have even more products to market over this 
period, plus the cost savings should accelerate our earnings by about $0.06 were share by the second year, by 
2004. 
GHARIB: Now, you have may have a robust pipeline and even with Pharmacia on board, but given the Food and 
Drug Administration has been a little bit slow about the approval process, aren`t you vulnerable to any kind of 
delays and timing issues? 
MCKINNELL: The biggest vulnerability in the pharmaceutical business are patent expirations, which is what is 
affecting many of our competitors. Neither Pfizer nor Pharmacia have significant patent expirations for the next 
few years. We do have a number of new products with the FDA for approval, but they`ve either been approved 
already or they`re in the late stage of the approval process. Most of our growth will come out of the inline 
products. 
GHARIB: As you know, there`s been a tremendous pressure on drug companies to limit their price increases. Do 
you think that Pfizer, now with Pharmacia, is better or worse off? 
MCKINNELL: Well, we`re much better off. In fact, during the past decade we held our price increases to less than 
the rate of inflation. We`re one of only a small number of companies to have done so. This merger gives us the 
financial flexibility to deal with whatever challenges come to us in the next several years. 
GHARIB: You talk about challenges. I mean this is certainly a very tough environment. We`ve talked about pricing 
pressures, federal government approval and then, of course, there is the market conditions, today being a really 
tough day. Why did Pfizer decide to do this merger now? 
MCKINNELL: Well, there are a number of financial benefits to this transaction, up to $2.5 billion of cost savings, 
the opportunity to accelerate top line growth and taking risk out of our business. We will be more diversified by 
product, by therapeutic category, by country, and we will have the financial flexibility to deal with whatever might 
come. 
But basically there is a strong strategic rationale to this merger, as well, that allows to us better compete in an 
environment where payers are looking for lower costs, where the government is debating this week, in fact, 
reducing the patent term protection that we receive for the massive investments we make in medical innovation. 
GHARIB: Mr. McKinnell, we would like you to address some issues about your stock. Pfizer`s stock, like many of 
the drug companies, has been down sharply this year, and again, it was down today on the news of the merger. 
When do you think that your shareholders will see some upside? 
MCKINNELL: Well, over the past year we`ve been down about as much as the S&P 500 or, in fact, the drug 
index, down about 20 percent, a little bit less than the pharmaceutical index. Today was not unexpected. We 
certainly did not expect the market volatility that we saw today, but we did expect our stock to be down by $2 or 
so as the arbitragers buy Pharmacia and sell Pfizer in order to -- 
GHARIB: When do you see a turn?

Page 74 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
MCKINNELL: I think we`ll see a turn tomorrow, quite frankly. 
GHARIB: OK. 
Well, good luck to you and thank you very much for talking to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. 
MCKINNELL: Thank you. Thank you, Susie. 
KANGAS: I guess I could say about today`s market, I`ve got the yo-yo if you`ve got the string. It was wild and 
very active, of course, down only 45 1/3 points on the close after being down about 10 times as much as that. But 
the advance/decline ratio still not very good. Only 9 stocks up for every 23 down. 38 new yearly highs as against 
343 new lows. 
Pfizer (PFE) topped the active list on nearly 94 million shares, down $3.42. It traded as low as $26.95 on the 
merger with Pharmacia (PHA). And incidentally, that stock swap deal is worth about $40.30 to Pharmacia 
holders at the end of this day based on the drop in Pfizer`s stock. 
General Electric (GE) down $0.35. 
AOL Time Warner (AOL) a $0.06 drop there. 
And then Duke Energy (DUK) fell $1.04. Federal regulators are already probing the company`s energy trading 
practices and today Salomon Smith Barney, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs all downgraded the stock. 
Tyco International (TYC) moved up $0.75. There was a rumor on the Street Carl Icahn may have purchased 
about $50 million in Tyco`s stock. 
Home Depot (HD) up $0.91. The company reaffirmed its second quarter earnings would come in at $0.47 a share 
and it expects 18 to 20 percent earnings growth through the year 2004. And Home Depot also plans to buy back 
up to $2 billion worth of its own stock. 
ExxonMobil (XOM) down $0.78. Oils were weak today. Oil futures down about $0.50 a barrel. 
Lucent Technologies (LU) up $0.13. 
And then Citigroup (C) managed to gain $0.59, tenth in volume. 
Air Products & Chemicals (APD) down $1.17. The Sanford Bernstein Brokerage downgraded a number of 
chemical stocks, including this one, from "outperform" to "market perform." 
Bristol-Myers (BMY) moved up $1.20. It is now seen as a takeover tonight in light of Pfizer`s buyout bid for 
Pharmacia. Merck (MRK) has been mentioned as a suitor. 
DuPont (DD), another weak chemical stock, down $1.23. Bernstein downgraded this one from "market perform" 
to "under perform." 
Fannie Mae (FNM) moving up $2.10. The company in with second quarter earnings of $1.44, $0.03 better than 
the Street estimate. 
FleetBoston Financial (FBF) down $1.62. Second quarter operating earnings lower, $0.60 versus last year`s 
$0.67. Overall, though, the company had a loss because of a $1.1 billion charge related to its problems in 
Argentina. 
And Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) down $1.50. Bank America links the weakness to the Pfizer-Pharmacia merger. 
Dave & Buster`s (DAB) one of the best gainers of the day percentage wise, up $1.65. A management group and 
Invest Corp. have sweetened their buyout bid from $12 to $13.50 a share cash. 
Airborne (ABF) moved up $1.18 after Prudential Securities upgraded it from "hold" to "buy." 
Armor Holdings (AH) down $8 a share. The company cut its second quarter earnings guidance from $0.28 all the 
way down to $0.16. It blamed its troubled Armor Group Services division, which it wants to sell. 
Fleetwood Enterprises (FLE) down $0.84. The company in with a fourth quarter loss of $1.15 and was rather 
uncertain about the future. Bleak might be the word.

Page 75 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Milacron (MZ) down a $1. The company delayed the release of its second quarter results from July 22 to the 24th. 
And Deutsche Telekom (DT) off $1.09. Investors apparently not at all happy about proposed management 
changes there. 
Nasdaq trading, a gain of 9.12 after being down well over 50 points. Trading volume up a touch from Friday. And 
for every 13 stocks higher, 21 lower. 
Microsoft (MSFT) topped the active list, losing $0.06. 
But Intel (INTC) was up $1.13. And earnings are due out tomorrow after the close. 
Cisco Systems (CSCO) a $0.06 gain. 
KLA-Tencor (KLAC) rose $2.50 a share. 
Dell Computer (DELL) up $0.41. Incidentally, Merrill Lynch recommended selling tech stocks into strength except 
for Dell. 
Amgen (AMGN) off $3.23. The Federal Trade Commission has approved the company`s takeover of Immunex. 
QLogic (QLGC) up $3.39. 
Oracle (ORCL) was up $0.47. 
eBay (EBAY) fell $0.22. 
tenth in Nasdaq dollar volume, Applied Materials (AMAT), which moved up $0.92. 
LanOptics Limited (LNOP) gained $1.85 on news it`s going to boost its stake in EZchip Technologies by nine 
percent, up to 66 percent. 
And then Ballard Power (BLDP) was down $3.10. A "Barron`s" article was very negative about the company`s 
burning cash at an alarming rate for a technology that won`t be used widely for about 10 years. 
And finally, Kendle International (KNDL) down $2.10, negative reaction to the Pharmacia buyout by Pfizer. 
The American Exchange Index (XAX) down 7 1/4 points. 
CPI Aerostructures (CVU) off $1.70, the biggest percentage loser. No one at the firm called us back. It could be 
profit taking. That stock has had quite a run-up recently. 
The same story with Anworth Mortgage (ANH) and no one returned our calls there. 
Finally, the Index Shares all fractionally in the plus column. 
That`s our Wall Street Wrap-Up. Susie? 
GHARIB: Paul, landmark legislation to overhaul the accounting industry is getting closer to reality tonight. Late 
today, the Senate approved a new oversight board to set and enforce rules for corporate auditors. And it has 
tough penalties for fraud. 
But as Darren Gersh reports, one key issue -- how to treat stock options --didn`t make it into the final bill. 
DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Senate had just turned to his 
amendment on expensing stock options, when Michigan Senator Carl Levin was informed the Dow was down 
more than 300 points. 
SEN. CARL LEVIN (D), MICHIGAN: But it surely adds an additional urgency, if we need an additional urgency, for 
why we should do everything in our power to restore public confidence in the financial systems in this country. 
GERSH: Levin and other critics argued current stock option accounting rules allow companies to inflate their 
earnings and give CEOs an incentive to cook the books. The Levin amendment requires the group that sets the 
nation`s accounting rules, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, to study the issue and adopt a new rule. 
But critics killed the amendment on a technicality, saying Congress shouldn`t be dictating accounting standards.

Page 76 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
SEN. PHIL GRAMM (R), TEXAS: Senator Levin, as I read it, wants a fair trial and then a hanging. 
GERSH: The stock options issue gained new momentum Sunday when Coca Cola (KO) announced it would start 
treating options as an expense. Coke joins a handful of major companies that include options on their bottom 
lines. The vast majority list stock options as a footnote on their financial statements. Venture capitalists say 
expensing stock options would hit small high tech startups hard. 
MARK HEESEN, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL VENTURE CAPITAL ASSOCIATION: Really, the only thing that small 
companies have to incite people to come from larger companies and work for smaller entrepreneurial companies 
is stock options. 
GERSH: The President believes each company should decide for itself how to handle stock options. But Mr. Bush 
urged Congress to move quickly on an accounting reform package. 
GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I`m willing to work with Congress to make sure 
that we`ve got the necessary law in place that will hold people accountable without stifling the entrepreneurial 
spirit of America. 
GERSH: Senator Levin calls stock option accounting the number one post-Enron reform. The issue may have 
been pushed aside today, but it`s likely to come up again when Congress considers legislation to safeguard 401K 
plans from corporate fraud. 
Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington. 
KANGAS: Tomorrow, the Fed chairman goes to Capitol Hill. Mr. Greenspan on the state of the economy. 
GHARIB: It looks like drkoop.com was a prescription for failure. The Web site that was at one time worth more 
than a billion dollars was sold today for $186,000. The buyer, a privately held nutrition products firm called 
Vitacost. Drkoop was started in 1997 by former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, but it became a case 
study in dot-com disaster, going from boom to bankruptcy in just a few years. 
KANGAS: The nation`s governors say the corporate accounting scandals plaguing Wall Street are spilling over 
into their Main Streets. At the National Governors Association meeting in Idaho today, the governors said their 
state economies are hurting because of layoffs from the accounting scandals and the sharp decline in U.S. 
financial markets. They`re also concerned about the impact of the markets` decline on state run pension funds. 
GHARIB: Recapping today`s market action, a stunning turnaround for Wall Street. The Dow ended off just 45 
points, and that`s after being down more than 400 points. And the NASDAQ gained 9. 
And please be sure to join us at our World Wide Web site, nbr.com. 
And finally tonight, donut maker Krispy Kreme (KKD) is celebrating its 65th birthday. And that means it needs a 
birthday cake, a birthday cake made of donuts, of course. And this is it, the world`s largest donut cake -- 18 feet 
wide and 12 feet tall, put together in Krispy Kreme`s hometown of Winston Salem, North Carolina. It has almost 
15,000 donuts, more than a thousand pounds of icing and 330 pounds of candy decorations. All of this sweet stuff 
weighs in at a whopping 2,400 pounds, which is about what anyone would weigh, I think, Paul, if they tried to eat 
it all. 
KANGAS: Oh, moderation, my dear. Moderation is the answer. 
GHARIB: Although, it would be great comfort food on a day like this that we had in the markets, wouldn`t it? 
KANGAS: That`s true. But that one would last you for about five years. 
GHARIB: We might just need that kind of comfort. 
That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, July 15. I`m Susie Gharib. Good night, everyone. Good night 
to you, Paul. 
KANGAS: Good night, Susie. I`m Paul Kangas wishing all of you the best of good buys.

LYNN NEARY, host: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Lynn Neary. 
ROBERT SIEGEL, host: 
And I'm Robert Siegel. 
The biggest drugmaker in the world is getting even bigger. Pfizer, maker of Viagra and the blockbuster 
cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, says it will buy drugmaker Pharmacia in a multibillion-dollar deal. NPR's 
Snigdha Prakash reports that the changing economics of the drug industry drove this deal. 
SNIGDHA PRAKASH reporting: 
Any way you look at it, the new Pfizer will be a behemoth. Just add up the numbers. Together Pfizer and 
Pharmacia will have $48 billion of revenue coming in this year. They'll make $12 billion in profits thanks to 
another important number: 12 blockbuster drugs, coveted cash cows such as Viagra, Lipitor and the anti-arthritis 
drug Celebrex that bring in at least a billion dollars a year in sales. 
Henry McKinnell is CEO of Pfizer and reportedly the architect of this deal. 
Mr. HENRY McKINNELL (CEO, Pfizer): Simply put, Pfizer and Pharmacia are much stronger together than 
separately. 
PRAKASH: Health-care economist Uwe Reinhardt of Princeton University puts it another way. 
Mr. UWE REINHARDT (Princeton University): Usually a beleaguered industry, you will find, will merge. It's just 
simply a natural reaction to seek strength and size. 
PRAKASH: The drug business is the most profitable in the country, but Reinhardt and other analysts predict that 
expanding those profits will be an uphill slog. Drugmakers aren't turning out blockbusters like they used to, even 
though they're spending more on research and development. And even profits on those blockbusters aren't as 
secure as they used to be, what with politicians, insurers and employers breathing down drugmakers' necks and 
generic drugmakers clamoring to make cheap copies. 
So what's a drug giant to do? Ira Loss is executive vice president at the research firm Washington Analysis. 
Mr. IRA LOSS (Executive Vice President, Washington Analysis): In a deal like this Pfizer is able to make an 
acquisition. And rather than raise prices, they can increase their profits by cutting overhead. 
PRAKASH: Pfizer also has the largest and one of the most aggressive sales forces in the country. Pfizer sales 
reps have made household names of drugs discovered by other companies, and Pfizer clearly believes it can 
bring the same magic to Pharmacia's line of drugs. It already markets Pharmacia's biggest drug, Celebrex. 
But what of the core problem, the lack of new drugs? Pfizer and Pharmacia executives promised investors today 
that the new Pfizer will eventually build profits by being a better drug sleuth. Ira Loss isn't buying that. 
Mr. LOSS: My guess is that when they're done with combining the research operations of these two companies 
the amount spent on R&D will be less than what the two are spending separately. 
PRAKASH: Analyst Hemant Shaw says this deal will spur many more.

Page 79 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Mr. HEMANT SHAW (Analyst): This is a catalyst, and it's going to force many other pharmaceutical companies to 
finally accept merger. And I think it's going to involve almost all pharmaceutical companies over the next several 
years. 
PRAKASH: Shaw says he expects industry stalwarts such as Bristol-Myers, Schering-Plough and Wyeth will soon 
be swallowed by bigger giants such as Johnson & Johnson and Aventis. 
Corporate mergers have trickled to a standstill in the midst of all the turmoil on Wall Street, and today Wall Street 
didn't seem very excited about Pfizer's acquisition. The drugmaker's stock fell 10 percent. Snigdha Prakash, NPR

(c) 2002 Reuters Limited 
NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc., the world's largest drug firm, will acquire smaller rival Pharmacia 
Corp. for $60 billion in stock, published reports said on Monday, creating an industry behemoth with a broad array 
of best-selling products. 
The transaction is expected to be announced later on Monday, said the New York Times' and Wall Street 
Journal's Web sites, citing people familiar with the matter. 
The merger would create an industry giant boasting more than $48 billion in annual revenue and combine several 
top-selling drugs, including Pfizer's Viagra and Lipitor, the popular cholesterol-lowering drug, along with 
Pharmacia's top-selling arthritis drugs, Celebrex and Bextra. 
It also would bolster Pfizer's already strong position as the top drug maker in the United States, while vaulting it to 
top spots in Europe, Japan and Latin America, the New York Times said. 
Pfizer and Pharmacia did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 
Terms of the transaction call for New York-based Pfizer to exchange 1.4 of its shares for each Pharmacia share, 
the papers said. That would value the Peapack, New Jersey-based Pharmacia at $45.08 per share, a 38 percent 
premium to the company's closing price Friday of $32.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Pfizer shareholders would own 77 percent of the combined company, the papers said, and its chairman and chief 
executive, Henry McKinnell, would retain the same titles after the merger. Pharmacia Chairman and CEO Fred 
Huggan will become vice-chairman of the company's board. 
The transaction has been approved by the boards of both companies, the reports said. Pharmacia also intends to 
continue with its previously announced plan to spin off its 84 percent stake in U.S.-based agricultural products 
maker Monsanto Co., the papers said. 
The deal comes as large drug companies around the world scramble to consolidate as an overall slowdown in 
revenues and new drugs hit the market. Pfizer pulled off one of the most successful mergers in recent memory 
when it acquired rival Warner-Lambert Co. in February 2000 for $114 billion. 
It also marks the largest acquisition proposal in what has been an otherwise dismal year. 
Global merger volume was down almost 50 percent through the first six months of 2002, said research firm 
Thomson Financial.

STOCKHOLM/NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc., the world's largest drug firm, will acquire smaller rival 
Pharmacia Corp. for $60 billion in stock, published reports said on Monday, creating an industry behemoth with a 
broad array of best-selling products. 
U.S.-Swedish Pharmacia declined comment on the takeover reports but said it would release a statement later in

"We are going to distribute a press release later on today. Until the...press release we don't have any comments,"

maker Monsanto Co., the papers said.

The deal comes as large drug companies around the world scramble to consolidate as an overall slowdown in 
revenues and new drugs hit the market. Pfizer pulled off one of the most successful mergers in recent memory 
when it acquired rival Warner-Lambert Co. in February 2000 for $114 billion. 
It also marks the largest acquisition proposal in what has been an otherwise dismal year for M&A. 
Global merger volume was down almost 50 percent through the first six months of 2002, said research firm 
Thomson Financial and, until the Pfizer deal, the year's biggest deal so far between public firms was National Grid 
Group PLC's $9.4 billion acquisition of Lattice Group PLC.

CADWALADER, WICKERSHAM & TAFT provided legal counsel to Pfizer Inc. in its agreement to buy Pharmacia 
Corp. A page-one article yesterday incorrectly gave the law firm's name as Codwalader, Wickersham & Taft. 
(WSJ July 16, 2002) 
In the biggest corporate combination in more than a year, Pfizer Inc. agreed to buy Pharmacia Corp. for stock 
valued at $60 billion, giving what is already the world's biggest drug company full rights to one of the industry's 
crown jewels, the blockbuster arthritis drug Celebrex. 
The deal, which is expected to be announced today, would create an industry behemoth with over $48 billion in 
revenue and a research-and-development budget of more than $7 billion. The new combination would be the 
world's largest drug maker by far and the leading pharmaceutical company by revenue in every major market 
around the globe. 
That any company would strike a deal amid the stock market turbulence of recent months is surprising. Corporate 
accounting scandals, plunging share prices and economic uncertainty have made companies reluctant to strike 
bold "transformational" deals, while several big mergers -- such as AOL-Time Warner -- have faced strong 
investor criticism. While the Pfizer-Pharmacia deal is seen as practical, it's unclear how investors will react to 
such a large deal in the uncertain market environment. 
The deal comes amid unprecedented pressure on pharmaceutical companies, as the industry struggles with a dry 
spell in its research labs, fights rising competition from generics makers and wrestles with intense pressure on 
prices from governments and private buyers around the world. As a result, drug companies are facing slowing or 
declining revenue and are watching their stocks sink to their lowest level in years. 
Under terms of the deal, Pharmacia will proceed with its previously announced plans to spin off its remaining 
84% ownership of Monsanto Co. to its current shareholders. After the spinoff, Pharmacia shareholders will 
receive 1.4 shares of Pfizer stock for each share of Pharmacia, valuing Pharmacia stock at $45.08 per share, 
representing a 36% premium over Pharmacia's Friday closing price. 
In addition to the blockbuster Celebrex, the transaction will join Pfizer's dominant cardiovascular franchise -- 
including the cholesterol drug Lipitor and the blood pressure pill Norvasc, as well as its Zithromax antibiotic and 
its epilepsy medicine Neurontin -- with such popular Pharmacia drugs as Xalatan for glaucoma and the cancer 
drug Camptosar. 
People familiar with the transaction expect minimal antitrust problems because the companies have few 
overlapping products and because Pfizer's global share of total pharmaceutical sales -- currently at 8% -- would 
rise only to about 11% if the deal is completed. However, one potential antitrust roadblock could be in the area of 
urinary incontinence, where Detrol, Pharmacia's blockbuster-in-the-making was poised to get competition from 
Pfizer's Darifenacin, which it expects to submit for Food and Drug Administration approval this year. 
The Pfizer-Pharmacia deal is expected to heighten pressure for other companies to consider combinations -- 
including industry giants Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Merck & Co., which have been hard-hit by generic 
competition as their flagship medicines lose patent protection. 
A Pharmacia spokesman and a Pfizer spokeswoman declined to comment.

Pfizer's move, which is largely the brainchild of Pfizer CEO Henry McKinnell, echoes its acquisition two years 
ago of another of its partners, Warner-Lambert, in a $115 billion deal that gave it full control over the 
cholesterol-lowering drug, Lipitor. In recent years, big mergers had fallen into disfavor with some industry 
executives, who note that companies that pursued that tack, such as GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Co., failed to solve their problems -- particularly in research -- and appeared to be distracted by the 
merger process. 
Pfizer's acquisition of Warner-Lambert, however, is considered one of the success stories to emerge from the raft 
of drug industry-combinations in the mid-1990s. In that case, Pfizer's acquisition was hostile, so it was free to 
unilaterally cut Warner-Lambert operations and personnel to make the operations meld smoothly. 
As in the Warner-Lambert deal, Pfizer is capturing a blockbuster drug, in this case Celebrex and its follow-on 
drug, Bextra, both of which it already markets with Pharmacia, a mid-sized drug company based in Peapack, N.J. 
Buying the company will give Pfizer full control over the Celebrex-Bextra arthritis franchise. The two drugs are 
expected to have combined sales of $3.75 billion this year. 
But growth will be a tall order, given the massive sales base of the new Pfizer. To still be considered a 
respectable growth company, Pfizer will have to come up with $5 billion or more in new revenue each year. In the 
past three years, Pfizer has struggled to find replacements for some of its aging blockbusters, launching only two 
new medicines on the U.S. market that were discovered by company researchers, a schizophrenia treatment 
called Geodon, with sales of just $150 million in 2001, and Vfend, an antifungal drug approved in May. Its last 
smash hit was Viagra, launched four years ago. Despite a strong first quarter, Pfizer warned of a sharp decline in 
profits for the current quarter, though it affirmed longer-term growth targets. 
Industry experts have long speculated about a deal between Pfizer and Pharmacia because of the good strategic 
fit. The two companies have had a partnership since 1998 to market Celebrex, the world's leading arthritis 
medicine and the No. 7 global drug overall, and have continued that arrangement with Bextra, a 
second-generation medicine la unched in the U.S. this spring. 
In Pharmacia, Pfizer is acquiring a relatively strong drug company, with four drugs that have $1 billion-plus sales 
or potential sales. That could give Pfizer, with eight drugs already at those sales levels, an even dozen 
blockbusters. Moreover, Pharmacia's major drugs don't face any patent threats for years. Its cancer drug 
Camptosar is the closest to patent expiration -- in 2007. 
Pharmacia said it expects per-share earnings to rise 15% to 17% in the second quarter. Analysts expect 
double-digit earnings per-share gains for Pharmacia from 2003 to 2006. Pfizer has been looking to expand into 
the lucrative market for cancer drugs, a strength of Pharmacia's, and also picks up ophthalmology, where 
Pharmacia's glaucoma treatment Xalatan is already on the verge of $1 billion in annual sales. 
Pfizer is also getting Pharmacia's top executive, Fred Hassan, who has emerged as a rising star in the industry, 
in part because of his turnaround of Pharmacia, which was created through the merger of two weak drug makers, 
Pharmacia of Sweden and Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo, Mich. Mr. McKinnell, Pfizer's 59-year-old CEO, will be chief 
executive and chairman of the combined company. Mr. Hassan, 56, chairman and chief executive of Pharmacia, 
will become vice chairman of Pfizer and a member of the board, the only Pharmacia board member to sit on the 
combined drug maker's board. 
According to people familiar with the situation, the deal talks began this spring, when Mr. McKinnell approached 
Mr. Hassan after the two appeared at a meeting of both companies' sales forces in Atlanta to prepare for the 
Bextra launch. Mr. McKinnell broached the subject of an acquisition, and Mr. Hassan "was very receptive," 
according to a person close to the situation. 
The trading patterns of both stocks helped nurture the deal, since their share prices have been trading roughly in 
tandem for months. In April, when Pfizer and Pharmacia first started their discussions, both stocks were trading 
above $40 a share. By summer, however, when the market swooned and accounting troubles started to infect the 
health-care industry, Pfizer and Pharmacia fell to the low 30s. With both share prices falling at roughly the same 
rate, the companies could negotiate a share ratio without worrying about one stock swinging wildly out of range. 
"It made it easier to hold discussions with the stocks trading in parallel, which is rather rare," said one person 
close to the discussions. 
Pfizer shareholders will own about 77% of the company, with Pharmacia shareholders owning around 23%. The 
deal, which is expected to close by year-end 2002, is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies and

Page 85 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
regulators. The deal isn't expected to dilute Pfizer's 2003 adjusted net income and to add about six cents a share 
to earnings in 2004. 
The deal is expected to allow the new Pfizer to cut costs, creating some breathing room to find new drugs. People 
familiar with the deal expect those savings to amount to $1.4 billion in 2003, with savings growing to $2.5 billion 
by 2006. As part of the deal, Pfizer is expected to reaffirm its double-digit revenue growth and diluted 
earnings-per-share growth of at least 15% a year for 2003 and 2004. 
Pharmacia shares closed at $32.59, up 42 cents, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, 
while Pfizer fell 40 cents to $32.20, also on the Big Board. 
Pfizer, feared and sometimes cursed by rivals for its brashness, hopes the deal will cement its status as the 
leading company in the global pharmaceutical industry. Ten years ago, most drug-company CEOs decided the 
rise of managed-care companies and government proposals for universal care meant the end of the large sales 
forces and huge marketing campaigns. Most executives in the industry predicted that government or 
managed-care groups would choose which drugs to buy no matter how much salesmen tried to persuade doctors 
otherwise. Merck & Co. and other companies cut their sales forces and slashed their marketing expenses. Pfizer 
did just the opposite -- adding salesmen and investing heavily in smart marketers. 
Pfizer proved prescient, surpassing everyone else in the industry on the strength of the organization's selling 
power. Merck eventually acknowledged it had made a mistake and has been steadily adding to its sales and 
marketing forces since the mid-1990s, playing catch-up ever since. By having a large sales force, Pfizer was also 
able to license blockbuster drugs from others -- including Lipitor and Celebrex -- and turn them into even larger 
sellers. Sales of Lipitor, after Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert, "exploded," a person familiar with this deal said. 
Pfizer hopes the Pharmacia arthritis franchise would show similar results. 
Now Pfizer is doing it again, betting heavily that size is what counts most. The combined company will put even 
more distance between itself and its rivals in two of the most important parts of the drug business: sales and 
research. Pfizer expects to spend $5.2 billion on finding and developing drugs this year, already about 20% more 
than GlaxoSmithKline, the next biggest spender. Add in Pharmacia's $2.2 billion in research spending, and the 
combined company would have a research budget nearly one-third the size of the National Institutes of Health. 
In the war for drug sales, the expanded Pfizer would field 13,000 sales representatives in the U.S. alone, more 
than any other drug company. A person familiar with Pfizer's plans said the sales force could grow even larger to 
support new products in the works at both companies. 
The deal would enhance Mr. McKinnell's status as master-builder within the drug industry. For years, Mr. 
McKinnell's management prowess and intellect had put him on the short-list of other drug company's executive 
searches before he assumed the CEO post at Pfizer. Mr. McKinnell, who was raised in British Columbia, Canada, 
joined Pfizer in 1971 in Tokyo and has been with the company ever since. Nearly half his career was spent in 
overseas posts, including stints in Hong Kong, Iran and Japan. 
His rise mirrors the ascent of Pfizer within the drug industry. In 1990, Pfizer ranked No. 14 among 
pharmaceuticals makers. The company became No. 1 in May 2000 through the Warner-Lambert acquisition. 
Pfizer Inc. rewarded Mr. McKinnell, who executed the takeover of Warner-Lambert Co., with the top job at Pfizer 
in January 2001, when he succeeded William Steere as chief executive. 
The deal is expected to get tough scrutiny from antitrust enforcers given its size, according to people familiar with 
the situation. The transaction will likely be reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission, rather than the Justice 
Department, because of the agency's expertise in drug-industry mergers. 
The FTC is likely to do a market-by-market investigation of the two companies and could seek divestitures or 
compulsory licensing in areas where the two companies have a combined dominant market share. 
Last week the FTC approved the $16 billion buyout of Immunex Corp. by Amgen Inc. but demanded divestitures 
or licensing agreements in three market areas. The agency is also likely to inspect the two companies' 
development pipelines for potential overlaps in future product areas. 
For Pharmacia, the deal may reflect a realization that to compete effectively, the company had to get bigger fast. 
Pharmacia had already enlisted Pfizer's brawn with Celebrex to great success and continue the arrangement 
with Bextra. Next year Pharmacia probably would have had to find a marketing partner again for help with 
eplerenone, a drug for heart failure and high blood pressure, awaiting FDA approval.

A person familiar with the deal expects that the market will support the combination with Pharmacia, in part 
because of the credibility Pfizer executives believe they earned by integrating Warner-Lambert. Every drug that 
Warner-Lambert and Pfizer sold as separate companies had higher sales in the combined company. "The 
strategic merit is very, very strong," that person said. 
Even if Pfizer can pull off a second major deal in such a short span, there's no guarantee that the larger company 
will be any better equipped to fight off the ails afflicting the entire industry. 
Pfizer was advised by Lazard LLC and Bear Stearns & Co. and Pharmacia was advised by Goldman Sachs & 
Co. Codwalader, Wickersham & Taft provided legal counsel to Pfizer, and Sullivan & Cromwell provided legal 
counsel to Pharmacia.

Prescription for Growth: Merger Fulfills Hassan's Vow To Bring About a `Powerhouse'

The last time Fred Hassan was involved in a blockbuster drug-industry deal, he was decidedly on the defensive. 
Two and a half years ago, the Pharmacia Corp. chief executive officer had agreed to merge with Monsanto Co., 
and investors gave the announcement a Bronx cheer. 
Mr. Hassan stuck by his belief in the deal. "We are going to make this into a pharmaceutical powerhouse," he 
declared at the time of the acquisition. 
In agreeing to sell Pharmacia to Pfizer Inc. for $60 billion in stock, he has in a fashion delivered on this promise -- 
helping to create by far the world's largest drug company. And he has established himself as a successful 
industry- turnaround artist. 
"Fred Hassan has made a career out of taking broken pieces and putting them together and making them work," 
a person familiar with the deal said. For Mr. Hassan, the Pfizer offer represented a way for Pharmacia and its 
shareholders "to participate in the biggest, and the best and hopefully the fastest-growing company that could 
bring the most new products to market the soonest," this person said. 
It was through Monsanto's Searle unit that Mr. Hassan acquired the blockbuster arthritis drug Celebrex that both 
revived Pharmacia's financial performance and set up a relationship with Pfizer that ultimately led to the current 
transaction. 
But Mr. Hassan has never made a secret of his desire to continue his deal-making. Almost as soon as the ink was 
dry on the Monsanto merger, he began talking openly of yet another deal. The object of his desires: Wyeth, where 
he spent years as a senior executive. In private conversations, Mr. Hassan often said he would love to merge 
Pharmacia with his old company. 
When Wyeth -- then known as American Home Products Corp. -- lost out to Pfizer in its bid to acquire 
Warner-Lambert Co., Mr. Hassan seemed poised to step in as a rebound suitor. It didn't happen. Through a 
mixture of luck and good science, Wyeth has recovered and no longer needs a partner. So Mr. Hassan had to 
look elsewhere to build the behemoth he has envisioned much of his career. Going with Pfizer, he has agreed to 
surrender control of his company: Pfizer's Henry McKinnell will remain as chairman and CEO. Mr. Hassan will be 
vice chairman. 
When Mr. Hassan left a top post at AHP in 1997 to take the helm of Pharmacia, the company was known as 
Pharmacia & Upjohn and it was in deep trouble. Sales were declining and the company -- with operations in 
Sweden, Michigan and Italy -- was still reeling from the 1995 merger in which it was formed. 
Mr. Hassan persuaded the board to relocate the company's headquarters to the U.S., eased out recalcitrant 
executives and ordered up a list of experimental drugs in development. He cut several projects he didn't think 
would be clear winners in the marketplace and then set about trying to diversify the company's product line 
beyond Celebrex. Indeed, even before the Monsanto acquisition, Pharmacia acquired Sugen Inc. to bolster its 
cancer franchise, currently dominated by the chemotherapy agent Camptostar. 
Two years ago Mr. Hassan took direct control of Pharmacia's fierce battle to maintain Celebrex's dominance over 
Merck & Co.'s rival pill, Vioxx. Merck appeared to be on the verge of winning that war. Through a no-holds-barred 
negative campaign against Vioxx-and with a lucky break from a highly publicized study that suggested heart 
concerns with Vioxx but didn't suggest any with Celebrex, the Pharmacia product not only stayed on top of Vioxx 
but also is now pulling away again.

As for the reason the Monsanto deal caused so much investor consternation? There wasn't a premium for 
investors, who also worried that Monsanto's agriculture business would be a drag on pharmaceutical business 
performance. Before any deal with Pfizer closes, Pharmacia is moving forward with plans to spin off the 83% of 
Monsanto it still owns.

In the biggest corporate combination in more than a year, Pfizer Inc. agreed to buy Pharmacia Corp. for stock 
valued at $60-billion (U.S.), giving the world's biggest drug company full rights to one of the industry's crown

would be the world's largest drug maker by far and the leading pharmaceutical company as measured in

The deal comes amid unprecedented pressure on pharmaceutical companies, as the industry struggles with a dry

Pfizer makes 38.6 billion pound swoop for rival Pharmacia. 
Pfizer makes 38.6 billion pound swoop for rival Pharmacia.

DRUG giant Pfizer has agreed to buy smaller rival Pharmacia for 38.6 billion pounds in stock, according to 
published reports, and analysts say it could trigger a fresh round of consolidation in the global drugs industry. 
The marriage of Pfizer and Pharmacia would create a new pharmaceutical colossus, with a global market share 
of about ten per cent, nearly half as big again as its nearest rival, GlaxoSmithKline. 
"It will be a very serious competitive threat to others," said Martin Hall, head of pharmaceuticals research at 
HSBC Securities in London. "The question now is whether companies like Glaxo, Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb 
are forced to do something themselves because of the threat." 
The transaction is expected to be announced later today. 
The enlarged company would boast annual sales of more than #33bn and bring together several top-selling 
drugs, including Pfizer's Viagra and Lipitor, the popular cholesterol-lowering drug, along with Pharmacia's 
top-selling arthritis drugs, Celebrex and Bextra. 
It would also bolster Pfizer's strong position as the top drug producer in the United States, while vaulting it to top 
spots in Europe, Japan and Latin America. 
Pfizer shareholders would own 77 per cent of the combined company, the papers said, and its chairman and chief 
executive, Henry McKinnell, will retain the same titles after the merger. Pharmacia chairman and CEO Fred 
Hassan will become vice-chairman of the company's board. 
Analysts said the hefty premium Pfizer was ready to pay reflected the value it was likely to extract from Celebrex, 
the top-selling arthritis drug which Pfizer and Pharmacia have collaborated in marketing since 1998. 
According to reports, Pfizer expects cost savings of #760 million in 2003, rising to #1.72bn by 2005.

In the biggest corporate combination in more than a year, Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to buy Pharmacia Corp. 
(PHA) for stock valued at $60 billion, giving what is already the world's biggest drug company full rights to one of 
the industry's crown jewels, the blockbuster arthritis drug Celebrex, Monday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
The deal, which is expected to be announced Monday, would create an industry behemoth with over $48 billion in 
revenue and a research-and-development budget of more than $7 billion. The new combination would be the 
world's largest drug maker by far and the leading pharmaceutical company by revenue in every major market 
around the globe. 
That any company would strike a deal amid the stock market turbulence of recent months is surprising. Corporate 
accounting scandals, plunging share prices and economic uncertainty have made companies reluctant to strike 
bold "transformational" deals, while several big mergers -- such as AOL-Time Warner -- have faced strong 
investor criticism. While the Pfizer-Pharmacia deal is seen as practical, it's unclear how investors will react to 
such a large deal in the uncertain market environment. 
The deal comes amid unprecedented pressure on pharmaceutical companies, as the industry struggles with a dry 
spell in its research labs, fights rising competition from generics makers and wrestles with intense pressure on 
prices from governments and private buyers around the world. As a result, drug companies are facing slowing or 
declining revenue and are watching their stocks sink to their lowest level in years. 
Under terms of the deal, Pharmacia will proceed with its previously announced plans to spin off its remaining 
84% ownership of Monsanto Co. (MON) to its current shareholders. After the spinoff, Pharmacia shareholders 
will receive 1.4 shares of Pfizer stock for each share of Pharmacia, valuing Pharmacia stock at $45.08 per 
share, representing a 36% premium over Pharmacia's Friday closing price. 
In addition to the blockbuster Celebrex, the transaction will join Pfizer's dominant cardiovascular franchise -- 
including the cholesterol drug Lipitor and the blood-pressure pill Norvasc, as well as its Zithromax antibiotic and 
its epilepsy medicine Neurontin -- with such popular Pharmacia drugs as Xalatan for glaucoma and the cancer 
drug Camptosar. 
People familiar with the transaction expect minimal antitrust problems because the companies have few 
overlapping products and because Pfizer's global share of total pharmaceutical sales -- currently at 8% -- would 
rise only to about 11% if the deal is completed. However, one potential antitrust roadblock could be in the area of 
urinary incontinence, where Detrol, Pharmacia's blockbuster-in-the-making was poised to get competition from 
Pfizer's Darifenacin, which it expects to submit for Food and Drug Administration approval this year. 
The Pfizer-Pharmacia deal is expected to heighten pressure for other companies to consider combinations -- 
including industry giants Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Merck & Co., which have been hard-hit by generic 
competition as their flagship medicines lose patent protection. 
Pfizer's move, which is largely the brainchild of Pfizer CEO Henry McKinnell, echoes its acquisition two years 
ago of another of its partners, Warner-Lambert, in a $115 billion deal that gave it full control over the 
cholesterol-lowering drug, Lipitor. In recent years, big mergers had fallen into disfavor with some industry 
executives, who note that companies that pursued that tack, such as GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Co., failed to solve their problems -- particularly in research -- and appeared to be distracted by the 
merger process. 
A Pharmacia spokesman and a Pfizer spokeswoman declined to comment.

THE SKEPTIC: Pfizer Gives Europe Pharma CEOs A Headache

A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN 
LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Europe's pharmaceutical industry could really do without Pfizer (PFE) buying Pharmacia 
(PHA) right now. 
No offense to Pfizer CEO Henry McKinnell. The logic of the deal is compelling and Pfizer proved itself adept at 
swallowing Lipitor through the Warner-Lambert acquisition. 
What's unnerving is that a raft of European pharma CEO might now think the solution to their problems also lies in 
copycat deals. 
It doesn't. 
For starters, Pfizer is acquiring from a position of strength, yet too many of the industry's followers advocate drug 
companies merging to overcome weakness. Look at the names often touted: Bristol-Myers (BMY), Merck (MRK), 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Bayer (G.BAY) .... hardly a picture of health. 
Secondly, such mega-mergers do nothing to overcome the single biggest problem facing the pharmaceutical 
industry right now - the lack of R&D efficiency. 
On the contrary, it's a brave man who'd bet a Pfizer-Pharmacia $7 billion annual R&D budget will be more 
efficiently spent than Pfizer's standalone budget now. Difference is, with 13,000 sales reps, a dozen blockbusters 
and no patent expiries on Pharmacia's portfolio for several years, Pfizer can get away it. 
GSK's Chief Executive Jean-Pierre Garnier was so concerned about managing a $4 billion annual R&D budget 
efficiently that he split research into seven "centers of excellence" competing for funds. 
But GSK seems alone in tackling this R&D efficiency, or lack thereof. 
Instead, some industry followers still seem hellbent on pushing drug companies into mergers - usually naming 
weak, struggling partners as the best candidates. 
Relying on cost savings to maintain earnings growth merely delays the inevitable, even hiding the problem. 
And even for Europe's strongest, the rationale for M&A isn't compelling. 
For AstraZeneca (AZN), any deal now would be a distraction to management, which is trying to successfully 
launch cholesterol drug Crestor and cancer treatment Iressa. 
Aventis (AVE) and Sanofi (F.SAN) would need to find worthy partners that wouldn't dilute their strong earnings 
growth while giving them greater U.S. exposure. 
Unfortunately, it looks like Pfizer is about to walk off with the best pick. 
For Roche (Z.ROC), HIV drug T-20 looks exciting and Hepatitis C drug Pegasys has fast-track designation from 
the FDA. More importantly, it remains strong in oncology, a franchise the Pfizer-Pharmacia tieup won't squeeze it 
out of. 
But Roche still seems reluctant to sell itself to Novartis (NVS), even though Novartis CEO Daniel Vasella still 
appears a willing buyer.

Page 96 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
According to Multex, Roche trades on a multiple of about 28X 2003 earnings - implying a hefty M&A premium, 
given Novartis trades on a more realistic 19X, GSK on an unloved 14X and Aventis on 19X. 
Only Roche and Novartis offer stronger logic for a merger, but even a deal there would fall way short of the merits 
of the Pfizer deal. 
Roche aside, shareholders aren't building in a premium to European drug stocks for M&A activity ... yet. 
Let's hope they have the good sense not to mimic Pfizer's handiwork.

Some Wall Street bankers were surprised that Pfizer hired only two boutique banks to advise it on such a large 
deal, which has a host of capital-markets implications. 
Typically on a deal of that size, an acquirer such as Pfizer would have brought in a leading investment bank such 
as Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley. 
Merrill, for instance, helped advise Pfizer on its acquisition of Warner-Lambert. 
But dealmakers say because this deal was largely the brainchild of Pfizer Chief Executive Henry McKinnell it 
may have been hammered out largely between the two companies, with bankers only brought in to validate the 
transaction. 
With the Pfizer deal, by far the biggest transaction announced so far this year, Lazard catapulted to fourth place 
on Thomson Financial's closely watched investment-bank merger rankings, up from 12th place before Monday's 
announcement. 
Bear Stearns, meanwhile, leapt to 11th from 25th. 
"It shows what $60 billion does in a quiet market," says Richard Peterson, chief market strategist with Thomson 
Financial. "This deal represents almost 10% of the total value of M&A for the year globally, which was at $610 
billion prior to this deal." 
The next largest deal this year was Lattice Group PLC's (LSCC) $18.5 billion agreement to buy National Grid 
Group PLC. 
The Pfizer pact also helped improve the ranking of Goldman Sachs. The longtime adviser to Pharmacia moved 
comfortably into the top spot on Thomson's global merger table, up from second place before the deal. 
Given the dearth of deals, the rankings could easily be shuffled by a $10 billion transaction or two. That means 
boutique banks like Lazard and Bear Stearns, which have had a tough time competing against larger rivals in the 
lucrative mergers-and-acquisitions business, could slip in the rankings.

Pfizer CEO Seen As Consummate, If Bold, Company Man

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Henry McKinnell may be the consummate 
company man. 
A veteran of more than three decades of employment with the pharmaceutical giant, McKinnell appears to be 
unafraid to take aggressive steps, so long as they keep the company ahead of rivals, observers said. 
The latest move was Pfizer's announcement Monday that it plans to buy Pharmacia Corp. (PHA) for $60 billion in 
stock. If successful, the deal will give Pfizer full rights to the successful arthritis drug Celebrex. The merged entity 
will be huge, with more than $48 billion in revenue and a research budget of more than $7 billion. 
"It shows he's not beholden to anybody and he's going to do what's best for the company," said Mark 
Hesse-Withbroe, pharmaceutical analyst at Victory Capital Management, which owns shares of both companies. 
Hesse-Withbroe said McKinnell saw an opportunity in the current bear market - when merger and acquisition 
activity has been less than robust - to pick up Pharmacia on the cheap. 
One aspect of the latest deal that cuts against the traditional grain of large pharmaceutical mergers is that Pfizer 
plans to pay a significant premium over Pharmacia's stock price to acquire it, said Dr. Joseph Zammit-Lucia, 
president of Cambridge Pharma Consultancy. 
Typically, large corporate combinations in the industry have been mergers were there was no premium and 
shareholders expected to benefit in the future from cost cutting and post-merger synergies, Zammit-Lucia said. 
That means the Pharmacia deal may mark particular boldness on McKinnell's part, Zammit-Lucia said. 
Pfizer shares traded late Monday at $28.78, down $3.42, or 11%, on volume of 119 million shares. Average daily 
volume is 16 million shares. 
Pharmacia stock, meanwhile, traded late in the session at $39.25, up $6.66, or 20%, on volume of 60 million 
shares. Average daily volume is 5 million shares. 
Based on Friday's closing levels, the deal paid Pharmacia shareholders a 38% premium. 
The Pharmacia acquisition is similar to Pfizer's hostile $115 billion acquisition two years ago of Warner-Lambert 
Co., which gave the company full control over the Lipitor cholesterol drug, observers said. 
McKinnell, then Pfizer's president and chief operations officer, was instrumental in that transaction. 
"It has paid off in spades for Pfizer," said Todd Lebor, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. "Lipitor has probably been 
more popular than they imagined." 
McKinnell, now 59, started his career at Pfizer in 1971, when he joined the company's Tokyo office. Other 
non-U.S. stints followed, including one as head of the company's Asian operations. 
The executive went on to posts as head of the company's medical technology group and chief financial officer.

Page 99 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Shortly after the Warner-Lambert deal was complete, Pfizer announced that McKinnell would succeed retiring 
Chief Executive William Steere. He took over at the beginning of 2001. 
McKinnell had big shoes to fill, because Steere had grown the company into a major player, Lebor said. He rose 
to the task, however, by successfully overseeing the integration of Warner-Lambert, the analyst added. 
The acquisition of Warner-Lambert revealed a farsightedness on the part of the Pfizer management team, Lebor 
said. 
"They clearly understood this deal had 10 to 15 years of repercussions," he said. "It wasn't an immediate fix, or a 
reaction to market demands." 
Lebor said that farsightedness could be a result of McKinnell's Canadian upbringing. The executive grew up and 
attended college in British Columbia before earning graduate business degrees from Stanford University. 
"I think he has a little more laid-back attitude about him, and that allows him to look 10 years out," Lebor said.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Amid a steep drop in merger advisory work, Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE) $60 billion acquisition 
of Pharmacia Corp. (PHA) marks a coup for Lazard LLC and Bear Stearns & Co. 
Pfizer chose the two banks, which failed even to crack the top ten in merger advisory work in the first half of this 
year, as advisors on the acquisition, the largest transaction in the moribund mergers market for more than a year. 
Lazard has provided Pfizer with merger advice for more than 25 years, including the pharmaceutical giant's 
successful hostile bid for Warner-Lambert. 
Bear Stearns, meanwhile, previously advised Warner-Lambert on its defense against Pfizer's hostile bid. The 
bank also helped advise Pharmacia & Upjohn on its $27 billion merger with Monsanto Co. in 1999. 
Some Wall Street bankers were surprised that Pfizer hired only two boutique banks to advise it on such a large 
deal, which has a host of capital-markets implications. 
Typically on a deal of that size, an acquirer such as Pfizer would have brought in a leading investment bank such

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) announced plans Monday to buy Pharmacia Corp. (PHA) in a stock swap the companies valued 
at $60 billion. The acquisition gives Pfizer, already the world's biggest drug company, full rights to the blockbuster 
arthritis drug Celebrex. It also creates an industry behemoth with more than $48 billion in revenue and a 
research-and-development budget of more than $7 billion. 
Dow Jones Newswires coverage of this fast-moving story can be found under the stock symbol PFE. Below is a 
look at some of the latest coverage. 
Few Chemistry Problems Seen For Pfizer's 
Pharmacia Buy 
Both have blockbuster drug portfolios, aggressive marketing teams and dominant chief executives, but industry 
watchers expect few chemistry problems with Pfizer's acquisition of Pharmacia Corp. The reason: Just as it did 
two years ago with the acquisition of Warner-Lambert, Pfizer will likely act quickly to pare unnecessary employees 
and executives, leaving little room for battles over personalities and management styles. 
Pharmacia Holders May Benefit Even In Long Term 
Pfizer's shares have seen better days, and Monday's 13% decline after Pfizer announced plans to acquire 
Pharmacia Corp. in a $60 billion stock deal didn't help matters. So are Pharmacia shareholders getting much 
solid currency in this deal? 
IN THE MONEY: Monsanto And The Pfizer/ 
Pharmacia Arbitrage 
As is the case in a typical arbitrage, traders are taking long positions in the target company (in this case, 
Pharmacia) and a short position in the acquirer (Pfizer). But, instead of only two companies being affected, a 
third one has been drawn into the drama. That's because Pharmacia owns 84% of Monsanto (MON). 
Pfizer CEO In June Threw Investors Off The Track 
Slightly more than a month before Pfizer announced plans to acquire Pharmacia in a $60 billion stock deal, the 
giant drug company's chief executive threw investors off the track. In early June, Pfizer's Henry McKinnell 
indicated in a published interview that Pharmacia wanted to continue flying solo. 
Pfizer/ 
Pharmacia Deal Could Mean Earlier Monsanto Spin-off 
Pfizer's acquisition of Pharmacia could mean the spinoff of Monsanto could take place sooner than planned. 
However, the deal is seen having little impact on the St. Louis company in the long run. 
Pfizer/ 
Pharmacia Product Lines Seen Complementary

Page 103 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Sometimes when two companies marry, questions get raised about product overlap. But in this case, there's little 
of that. Instead, Pfizer and Pharmacia complement each other well, particularly in the cancer arena, where Pfizer 
doesn't have much presence and Pharmacia is considered very strong. 
Minimal Antitrust Issues Seen With Pfizer/ 
Pharmacia Deal 
A merger of drug giants Pfizer and Pharmacia would raise minimal antitrust concern, because the companies 
have few overlapping product lines and together would control only 11% of the global market, antitrust observers 
say. 
Pfizer's 
Pharmacia Buy No Help To Ailing Merger Market 
Pfizer's $60 billion acquisition of Pharmacia will do nothing to help resuscitate the ailing mergers and acquisitions 
market, some Wall Street bankers say. Instead, the double-digit plunge in Pfizer's stock price following news of 
the pact, announced Monday, may discourage other companies from making bold merger moves. 
Pfizer, 
Pharmacia Deal Pressures US Drug Makers But Few Options 
There is no doubt that Pfizer's pact to buy Pharmacia is going to put pressure on the rest of the U.S. drug makers 
to find their own big deal. Too bad so few companies are in any shape to pull it off. 
Pfizer/ 
Pharmacia Deal Helps Pfizer Maintain Growth 
These days it's not enough to just have a handful of multi-billion dollar drugs on the market. Investors want the 
promise of a pipeline that keeps putting a steady flow of new blockbuster medicines onto pharmacy shelves. 
Because of that, Pfizer went shopping to strengthen its current portfolio and beef up its future prospects. 
Pfizer CEO Doesn't See Any Antitrust Hangups 
Pfizer Chairman and Chief Executive Hank McKinnell said he doesn't expect any antitrust hang-ups, reiterating 
that the company expects to complete the acquisition in 2003. He made this statement and others in a lengthy 
conference call Monday. 
Pharmacia Acquisition Sends Pharmaceutical Stocks Higher 
Pharmacia is leading the pharmaceuticals sector higher on news that Pfizer will buy it for $60 billion. But weak 
earnings news from Pfizer and bad news from Millennium Pharmaceuticals is making for a mixed session. 
THE SKEPTIC: Pfizer Gives Europe Pharma CEOs A Headache 
Europe's pharmaceutical industry could really do without Pfizer buying Pharmacia right now. What's unnerving is 
that a raft of European pharma CEO might now think the solution to their problems also lies in copycat deals. It 
doesn't.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Slightly more than a month before Pfizer Inc. (PFE) announced plans to acquire 
Pharmacia Corp. (PHA) in a $60 billion stock deal, the giant drug company's chief executive threw investors off 
the track. 
In early June, Pfizer's Henry McKinnell indicated in a published interview that Pharmacia wanted to continue 
flying solo. 
That could very well have been true at the time, especially if Pharmacia was playing hard to get. But in choosing 
to address a potential merger with Pharmacia, McKinnell may have left a smoky trail for regulators. 
That's because both the U.S. Supreme Court and the Securities and Exchange Commission have ruled that 
companies can't make material misstatements about merger negotiations, but may simply answer "no comment." 
"You can't lie and the CEO is responsible for knowing," said Ed Fleischman, senior counsel at law firm, Linklaters, 
explaining the gist of the rule, established in two separate cases. 
According to a report in Monday's Wall Street Journal, discussions between Pharmacia and Pfizer began in April. 
In an interview published in Barron's Online on June 7, McKinnell said, "we think we can achieve our goals 
through partnerships as opposed to acquisitions," when he was asked whether another big merger or acquisition 
could be expected. 
Asked whether Pharmacia could be a target, he replied: "We have an extremely successful partnership with 
Pharmacia in the Cox-2 area, and they have no interest in being acquired by anybody." 
Spokesmen for the two companies didn't immediately return calls for comment, nor did a SEC spokesman. 
Whether a company official runs afoul of securities laws depends on factors such as at what level a particular 
courtship is going on, and if a banker was called in, said Fleischman, a former SEC commissioner. 
"Where the line goes from white to gray to black is very fact specific," he said. "We don't have enough facts to 
know." 
One securities law expert said that McKinnell's statements sounded "fairly innocuous" and unlikely to trigger an 
SEC enforcement action. 
"That could have been quite true in June. Until the moment they agreed, perhaps Pharmacia wanted to remain 
an independent company," said Columbia Law School professor John Coffee. Reading between the lines, Coffee 
guessed that McKinnell's statement indicated Pfizer "wasn't considering a hostile acquisition of Pharmacia." 
The SEC has shown a willingness to go after companies that it believes have crossed the line, even stretching its 
arm overseas as it did in a high-profile case in 2000. One of Germany's largest industrial holding companies, 
Veba AG, now E.On AG (EON), was sanctioned for deliberately issuing false and misleading statements with 
respect to its pending merger with Viag, another German company.

SUE HERERA, co-anchor: Drug giant Pfizer today took the wraps off the biggest merger Wall Street has seen in 
some time, the $60 billion acquisition of Pharmacia. Pfizer's CEO, Henry McKinnell, talked about the major 
advantages of a deal that expands what is already the world's biggest drug company. 
Mr. HENRY McKINNELL (Pfizer Chairman & CEO): The real benefit of this deal, of course, is on the revenue 
side. We do think the combined management of--of both the Pfizer and the Pharmac--Pharmacia portfolio will 
lead to higher revenues, just as it did in the combination with Warner-Lambert, and, of course, it reduces the risk 
in our business going forward. 
HERERA: And on news of the deal, Pfizer shares lost $3.41; Pharmacia rallied sharply, up $6.66. 
More on what that deal does to the likelihood of other mergers in the sector from Garrett Glaser. 
GARRETT GLASER reporting: 
You may not think so if you've priced a prescription lately, but these aren't the best of times for the big drug 
companies, as at the new Pfizer, size is one issue and going up against competitors, who always seem to be 
growing bigger. Many of big pharma's biggest drugs are going off patent, cheaper generics coming in and 
economies of scale are evermore attractive to CEOs forced by the marketplace to keep costs down. Not 
everybody thinks the Pfizer deal is the jumping-off point for more deals. 
Ms. SARAH ROSS (Banc of America Capital Management): You know, I do think that there are going to be some 
benefits in--in the form of marketing and in the form of R&D, but I also think that there's kind of a critical mass that 
these companies need to reach--that most them have already reached at this point--where they can develop R&D 
and develop new products successfully on their own. 
GLASER: The Pfizer deal means the combined company will have $48 billion a year in revenue and $7 billion a 
year for research and development, or R&D. How do the smaller players compete with that? 
Mr. LEN YAFFE (Banc of America Securities): We think that there's going to be a significant consolidation of the 
US pharmaceutical industry this decade. The largest company currently has about a 10-percent share of the US 
market. We think exiting this decade, the largest company will have more like a 15-percent share, and we think 
that that company will be Pfizer, and that other companies will also feel the pressure now to consolidate to be 
able to keep up with Pfizer's increasing leadership. 
GLASER: A deal like this one is significant because it comes at a tough time for the industry: market turbulence, 
corporate accounting scandals, economic uncertainty. There's something of a dry spell in new products, too, 
along with unprecedented pressure on pricing from the government and private health plans. 
Big pharma is facing slowing or dropping revenue and, frequently, the lowest stock price these companies have 
seen in years. Tough times mean some companies are itching to grow by acquisition. Among the takeover targets 
being mentioned: Bristol-Myers Squibb and Schering-Plough. Among the predators: Merck. Overseas deals that 
some analysts say would make sense include French giant Aventis, with Bayer of Switzerland, or Aventis with 
French drugmaker Sanofi-Synthelabo. 
Wyeth-Pharma, formally American Home Products, is considered another possible acquisition target, as is Eli 
Lilly. 
Mr. HEMENT SHAH (Independent Drug Analyst): We're going to see many mergers, which will eventually lead to 
six to 10 companies dominating the pharmaceutical market. 
GLASER: And by the way, Mr. Shah there owns neither Pfizer nor--nor Pharmacia stock, and he is extremely 
bullish about the merger. He says this acquisition is clearly the right move for both companies. Ron.

Pharmacia Move to New HQ on Hold

NEW YORK (AP) - The decision by Pfizer Inc. to acquire Pharmacia Corp. has disrupted plans for Pharmacia to 
move into AT&T Corp.'s former headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J. 
During a conference call Monday, Pfizer's chief executive Henry McKinnell said there are "no plans to move into 
the AT&T headquarters" in the near term. 
Pharmacia only closed on the acquisition of the property on July 1. Plans had been in the works to move 2,400 
Pharmacia employees into the complex in the first half of 2003. 
A Cushman & Wakefield executive, whose firm handled the sale for AT&T, said he'd be surprised if the property 
was put on the block again. He said the space is still needed for the employees regardless of the merger. 
Although he declined to disclose the price on the sale, citing a confidentiality agreement, several trade 
publications pegged it at about $200 million. 
The AT&T complex includes 1.3 million square feet of office space in 10 buildings, more than 3,900 parking 
spaces, 51 conference rooms, a fitness center, helipad, 140 acres of land, all surrounded by 2.7 miles of 
roadway, according to Cynthia Wasserberger, director of Colliers ABR Inc., a commercial real estate brokerage 
firm. The site can accommodate more than 4,000 employees.

More Pressure for Drug Cos. to Merge 
More Pressure for Drug Cos. to Merge

NEW YORK (AP) - Pfizer Inc. added to its formidable strengths as the pharmaceutical industry's leader with a $60 
billion acquisition of Pharmacia Corp. on Monday, pressuring its competitors toward similar mergers at a time of 
slimmer profits and angry consumers. 
The all-stock deal will create a pharmaceutical powerhouse with over $48 billion in revenues and a research 
budget of more than $7 billion. Pfizer is already the world's largest drug company when measured by the overall 
value of its stock. 
The merger combined Pfizer's widely recognized prowess for marketing with Pharmacia's drugs in the areas of 
oncology and ophthalmology, where Pfizer does not have a strong presence. 
The companies said the merger should provide $2.5 billion in cost saving by 2005, a particularly important point at 
a time when drug companies are finding it harder to produce new blockbuster medicines and are under growing 
public and government pressure to hold down prices. 
"That this brings cost-savings is obvious," said Pfizer chief executive Henry McKinnell. "But it creates a company 
that can grow more than the two companies could separately. It also significantly eliminates risk by expanding the 
product and market areas of the company." 
Pfizer manufacturers blockbusters such as cholesterol-lowering agent Lipitor and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, 
while Pharmacia makes the cancer drug Camptosar as well as Rogaine hair products and the Nicorette smoking 
cessation line. 
The companies already jointly market pain reliever Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra. The two drugs have 
already been outpacing new prescriptions of the competing product Vioxx, made by Merck & Co. 
The deal spells even more trouble for Merck, which has said its 2002 earnings will be flat because of patent 
expirations and slowing Vioxx sales. 
"It puts Merck at a disadvantage because you are going to see an even more unified approach to marketing the 
Celebrex and Bextra," said Tim Anderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities. 
Merck has said it wants to remain independent, but analysts said in this environment it may not have a choice. 
Combinations of patent expirations, drug delays and manufacturing issues have cast a pall over most drug 
companies. Some, like Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Schering-Plough Corp., are considered especially troubled 
and could become targets for acquisition if their stocks continue to slide. 
"Bristol may not look good at $60, but it is a different picture at $20," said independent analyst Hemant Shah. 
Some analysts have suggested that Bristol-Myers' experience in cancer and cardiovascular drugs may 
complement GlaxoSmithKline's competence in areas like anti-infection drugs. Merck and Schering could be a 
good fit because they are already jointly developing a cholesterol-lowering agent. European players such as 
Novartis and Aventis are considered purchasers so they can expand their presence in the United States. 
"Mergers may not lead to more better products, but if the companies don't do them they will be far worse off," said 
Shah.

Page 112 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
As drug revenues slide, companies have even less money to put into research and development to create the 
products that will revive sales. By cutting costs they can generate some savings that can be applied to research, 
Shah said. 
Moreover, bigger companies with more products have more bargaining power with states and insurance 
companies that are increasingly balking at rising drug prices. Many states and insurance companies are using 
their bargaining power, creating preferred drug lists based in part on pharmaceutical companies' willingness to 
agree to a reduced price. 
The drug companies have less bargaining power: Even combined, Pfizer and Pharmacia will have about 13 
percent of the U.S. market for pharmaceuticals. 
As drug companies merge, they will need more drugs to sustain them. 
"After the consolidation of the industry is done, overall earnings growth will slow," Shah said. 
Pfizer is no stranger to mergers. It was able to squeeze $1.8 billion in savings from its hostile takeover of 
Warner-Lambert in 2000. 
In the short term, the deal will smooth over Pfizer's earnings when some drugs' patents expire. Antifungal agent 
Diflucan is set to lose market exclusivity in 2004 followed by depression drug Zoloft in 2005. Over the course of 
2003 and 2004, Pharmacia is slated to introduce new drugs for hypertension, anxiety, arthritis and pulmonary 
disease. 
"It is a good fit for both companies," said Banc of America analyst Len Yaffe. "And it should be interesting to 
watch what the other companies do." 
Under the deal, Pharmacia shareholders would receive 1.4 shares of Pfizer stock for each share in Pharmacia. 
That represents $45.08 worth of stock based on Friday's closing Pfizer price and is a 36 percent premium over 
Pharmacia's closing price of $32.59 a share on Friday. 
On Monday, Pharmacia shares were up $7.32, or $22 percent, to $39.82 a share. The stock was that high three 
weeks ago but analysts said given the market conditions, the price Pfizer is paying is fair if not spectacular. 
"It may look like a steal in a lot of ways, but you just don't know where the market will be in a month or two," said 
Mark Hesse-Withroe, a research analyst at Victory Capital Management.

NEW YORK (AP) - Pfizer Inc. added to its formidable strengths as the pharmaceutical industry's leader with a $60 
billion acquisition of Pharmacia Corp. on Monday, pressuring its competitors toward similar mergers at a time of 
slimmer profits and angry consumers. 
The all-stock deal will create a pharmaceutical powerhouse with over $48 billion in revenues and a research 
budget of more than $7 billion. With $26.3 billion in pharmaceutical sales, Pfizer is already the world's largest drug 
company and its research budget of $5 billion dwarfed the rest of the industry by more than 50 percent. 
Pharmacia is the ninth largest drug company with pharmaceutical revenues of $12 billion. 
The merger combined Pfizer's widely recognized prowess for marketing with Pharmacia's drugs in the areas of 
oncology and ophthalmology, where Pfizer does not have a strong presence. 
The companies said the merger should provide $2.5 billion in cost saving by 2005, a particularly important point at 
a time when drug companies are finding it harder to produce new blockbuster medicines and are under growing 
public and government pressure to hold down prices. 
"That this brings cost-savings is obvious," said Pfizer chief executive Henry McKinnell. "But it creates a company 
that can grow more than the two companies could separately. It also significantly eliminates risk by expanding the 
product and market areas of the company." 
Stephen Lederer, a Pfizer spokesman, said it's not immediately clear how the merger would affect the drug 
company's operations in Connecticut. 
Pfizer's largest research and development site is in Groton, where about 4,500 employees work on a 160-acre 
campus, Lederer said. In adjacent New London, the company last year opened a global research and 
development headquarters where about 1,500 employees work, he said. 
"Groton New London is the nerve center of the global research and development activity of Pfizer," Lederer said. 
"We are very proud of what happens in Connecticut." 
The merger is expected to result in savings as a result of duplicate positions, but it's unclear which positions 
would be affected, Lederer said. 
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said his office will investigate the merger. 
"Our analysis will be conducted on a market sector-by-sector basis, drug by drug, to safeguard against a 
concentration of market power," Blumenthal said Monday. "Consumers should have the benefit of more 
affordable medicine, particularly generic drugs." 
Pfizer manufacturers blockbusters such as cholesterol-lowering agent Lipitor and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, 
while Pharmacia makes the cancer drug Camptosar as well as Rogaine hair products and the Nicorette smoking 
cessation line. 
The companies already jointly market pain reliever Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra. The two drugs have

Combinations of patent expirations, drug delays and manufacturing issues have cast a pall over most drug 
companies. Some, like Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Schering-Plough Corp., are considered especially troubled 
and could become targets for acquisition if their stocks continue to slide. 
"Bristol may not look good at $60, but it is a different picture at $20," said independent analyst Hemant Shah. 
Some analysts have suggested that Bristol-Myers' experience in cancer and cardiovascular drugs may 
complement GlaxoSmithKline's competence in areas like anti-infection drugs. Merck and Schering could be a 
good fit because they are already jointly developing a cholesterol-lowering agent. European players such as 
Novartis and Aventis are considered purchasers so they can expand their presence in the United States. 
"Mergers may not lead to more better products, but if the companies don't do them they will be far worse off," said 
Shah. 
As drug revenues slide, companies have even less money to put into research and development to create the 
products that will revive sales. By cutting costs they can generate some savings that can be applied to research, 
Shah said. 
Moreover, bigger companies with more products have more bargaining power with states and insurance 
companies that are increasingly balking at rising drug prices. Many states and insurance companies are using 
their bargaining power, creating preferred drug lists based in part on pharmaceutical companies' willingness to 
agree to a reduced price. 
The drug companies have less bargaining power: Even combined, Pfizer and Pharmacia will have about 13 
percent of the world market for pharmaceuticals, according to IMS Health Inc, a research firm. That relatively low 
number means analysts don't expect the deal to face major regulatory hurdles, especially since the two 
companies don't manufacture directly competing drugs. Pharmacia markets a bladder therapy drug and Pfizer is 
developing one, but that isn't viewed as a major problem. 
The companies acknowledged that there would be job cuts, but did not discuss a number. Pharmacia Corp. chief 
executive Fred Hassan said the move to place some employees into the former AT&T headquarters in New 
Jersey was on hold. 
As drug companies merge, they will need more drugs to sustain them. 
"After the consolidation of the industry is done, overall earnings growth will slow," Shah said. 
Pfizer is no stranger to mergers. It was able to squeeze $1.8 billion in savings from its hostile takeover of 
Warner-Lambert in 2000. 
In the short term, the deal will smooth over Pfizer's earnings when some drugs' patents expire. Antifungal agent 
Diflucan is set to lose market exclusivity in 2004 followed by depression drug Zoloft in 2005. Over the course of 
2003 and 2004, Pharmacia is slated to introduce new drugs for hypertension, anxiety, arthritis and pulmonary 
disease. 
"It is a good fit for both companies," said Banc of America analyst Len Yaffe. "And it should be interesting to 
watch what the other companies do." 
Under the deal, Pharmacia shareholders would receive 1.4 shares of Pfizer stock for each share in Pharmacia. 
That represents $45.08 worth of stock based on Friday's closing Pfizer price and is a 36 percent premium over 
Pharmacia's closing price of $32.59 a share on Friday. 
On Monday, Pharmacia shares were up $7.32, or $22 percent, to $39.82 a share. The stock was that high three 
weeks ago but analysts said given the market conditions, the price Pfizer is paying is fair if not spectacular.

"It may look like a steal in a lot of ways, but you just don't know where the market will be in a month or two," said 
Mark Hesse-Withroe, a research analyst at Victory Capital Management. 
Pfizer also announced Monday that its second quarter net income rose 7 percent to $1.96 billion, or 32 cents a 
share, from $1.83 billion, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. The performance matched the predictions of analysts 
surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Revenues rose 5 percent to $8 billion from $7.6 billion a year earlier. Sales of Lipitor rose 24 percent to $1.8 
billion while revenues from Viagra grew 10 percent to $385 million.

NEW YORK (AP) - Pfizer Inc. added to its formidable strengths as the pharmaceutical industry's leader with a dlrs 
60 billion acquisition of Pharmacia Corp. on Monday, pressuring its competitors toward similar mergers at a time 
of slimmer profits and angry consumers. 
The all-stock deal will create a pharmaceutical powerhouse with over dlrs 48 billion in revenues and a research 
budget of more than dlrs 7 billion. Pfizer is already the world's largest drug company when measured by the 
overall value of its stock. 
The merger combined Pfizer's widely recognized prowess for marketing with Pharmacia's drugs in the areas of 
oncology and ophthalmology, where Pfizer does not have a strong presence. 
The companies said the merger should provide dlrs 2.5 billion in cost saving by 2005, a particularly important 
point at a time when drug companies are finding it harder to produce new blockbuster medicines and are under 
growing public and government pressure to hold down prices. 
"That this brings cost-savings is obvious," said Pfizer chief executive Henry McKinnell. "But it creates a company 
that can grow more than the two companies could separately. It also significantly eliminates risk by expanding the 
product and market areas of the company." 
Pfizer manufacturers blockbusters such as cholesterol-lowering agent Lipitor and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, 
while Pharmacia makes the cancer drug Camptosar as well as Rogaine hair products and the Nicorette smoking 
cessation line. 
The companies already jointly market pain reliever Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra. The two drugs have 
already been outpacing new prescriptions of the competing product Vioxx, made by Merck & Co. 
The deal spells even more trouble for Merck, which has said its 2002 earnings will be flat because of patent 
expirations and slowing Vioxx sales. 
"It puts Merck at a disadvantage because you are going to see an even more unified approach to marketing the 
Celebrex and Bextra," said Tim Anderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities. 
Merck has said it wants to remain independent, but analysts said in this environment it may not have a choice. 
Combinations of patent expirations, drug delays and manufacturing issues have cast a pall over most drug

The all-stock deal will create a pharmaceutical powerhouse with over $48 billion in revenues and a research 
budget of more than $7 billion. With $26.3 billion in pharmaceutical sales, Pfizer is already the world's largest drug 
company and its research budget of $5 billion dwarfed the rest of the industry by more than 50 percent. 
Pharmacia is the ninth largest drug company with pharmaceutical revenues of $12 billion. 
The merger combined Pfizer's widely recognized prowess for marketing with Pharmacia's drugs in the areas of 
oncology and ophthalmology, where Pfizer does not have a strong presence.

INSIDE THE INDUSTRY - PFIZER: AGREES TO PURCHASE PHARMACIA FOR $60B IN STOCK

Pfizer Inc. has agreed to purchase the Pharmacia Corp. for $60 billion in stock, a move that would make Pfizer, 
already the largest pharmaceutical firm in the United States, the largest drug company in the world, the New York 
Times reports. The deal, approved yesterday by the boards of both companies, creates a "behemoth" drug 
company with almost $48 billion in projected annual sales. The merged company would produce at least a dozen 
of the "most widely used drugs" in the United States, including the antidepressant Zoloft, the anti-cholesterol 
medication Lipitor, the male impotence drug Viagra and arthritis drugs Celebrex and Bextra. According to the 
Times, the deal would help Pfizer sustain its current growth because 11 of the 12 blockbuster drugs the merged 
company would produce have patent protection until 2010. Further, Pharmacia has several promising drugs in 
the pipeline (Sorkin, New York Times, 7/15). 
The deal could expand Pfizer's research and development budget to $7 billion annually and allow it to support a 
sales staff of 13,000, more than any other drug company. An unidentified source close to Pfizer said the sales 
staff also may be expanded to support the larger lineup of blockbuster drugs (Frank/Hensley, Wall Street Journal, 
7/15). The merger is expected to produce savings of $1.4 billion in 2003 and $2.2 billion in 2004 through cuts in 
administrative costs, purchasing, manufacturing, distribution and research and development. It is not certain how 
many of the combined company's 150,000 employees will lose their jobs, the Times reports. Henry McKinnell, 
Pfizer's current chair and CEO, would become the merged company's chair, and Pharmacia Chair and CEO Fred 
Hassan would serve as vice chair and have a seat on the company's board. The proposed acquisition requires 
approval by regulators in the United States and Europe. Executives close to the deal said they expect it to go 
through by the end of the year (New York Times, 7/15). 
POSSIBLE PRECEDENT 
The Pfizer-Pharmacia merger is expected to "heighten pressure" on other pharmaceutical firms to consolidate, 
the Journal reports (Wall Street Journal, 7/15). Although analysts and investors have long expected that drug 
companies would combine in a "rash of mergers," such consolidation has not come to fruition. Pfizer's deal could 
prompt companies such as GlaxoSmithKline -- which has been "struggling" with a near-empty pipeline -- to seek 
out acquisitions "simply to remain competitive," the Times reports. Last month, GSK's Chief Financial Officer John 
Coombe said his company has been contemplating acquiring Bristol-Myers Squibb (New York Times, 7/15). The 
Journal reports that Merck & Co. also may be considering an acquisition or merger, as patent protections for 
many of its drugs continue to expire (Wall Street Journal, 7/15).

Henry McKinnell took the reins at Pfizer, the world's largest pharmaceuticals company, last year. Pfizer has a 
stellar earnings record, but McKinnell must find new avenues of growth as the company finishes integrating 
Warner-Lambert, which it acquired in 2000. 
Barron's Online: Do you expect Pfizer's 20%-to-30% earnings-growth rate to slow once the company has wrung 
all the cost savings out of the Warner-Lambert deal? 
McKinnell: We expect the growth rate will slow to 15% next year, which we believe is our sustainable growth rate. 
Q: Long term, Pfizer needs more blockbuster drugs. Is the pipeline strong enough? 
A: We are less dependent on our pipeline than almost any other company, because our leading products are 
growing strongly and are patent-protected well into this decade. But we have five [products] in the final stages of 
registration approval in either the U.S. or Europe. Beyond that, from 2001 to 2006, we expect to file 15 new drug 
applications. 
Q: Should we look for another big merger or acquisition? 
A: Don't know. We evaluate all possibilities, but we're pretty happy with our strategy of growing through research 
and development and partnership with others. We think we can achieve our goals through partnerships as 
opposed to acquisitions. 
Q: Is there any therapeutic area in which you would like to build your presence? 
A: Oncology is one. We are researching our way into a significant portfolio of cancer compounds. If we are 
successful, we would need to supplement our development, regulatory, sales and marketing capability. And we'd 
do that either internally or by partnering. 
Q: Bristol-Myers Squibb is strong in oncology. Is Bristol a potential partner? 
A: Well, everybody is a potential partner. It's very unlikely we would acquire Bristol-Myers Squibb, but there could 
be a possibility of a partnership here. 
Q: Could Pharmacia be a target? 
A: We have an extremely successful partnership with Pharmacia in the Cox-2 [arthritis] area, and they have no 
interest in being acquired by anybody. 
Q: How much more can your biggest drug, the anti-cholesterol agent Lipitor, grow? 
A: We currently have just over 50% of new prescriptions in the U.S. That leaves a little under 50% of the 
marketplace for expansion. Of the patients who should be treated for high cholesterol in the United States, only 
one-third currently are being treated. 
Q: Your sexual-dysfunction drug, Viagra, faces potential competition from drugs in development at Eli Lilly and 
Bayer. How will it compete?

Page 131 of 134 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
A: There are about three times more patients who would benefit from treatment than are being treated. So, there's 
enormous opportunity for market expansion. And those two products are not yet approved. 
Q: Could Pfizer lose patent protection for Neurontin before your next epilepsy drug, Pregabalin, is launched? 
A: We expect to prevail in this litigation. Even if we don't, there would be a 12-to-18-month appeal process. And 
anybody who tries to launch a generic thereafter has to get through regulatory requirements. 
Q: Do you expect a Medicare drug benefit to pass? 
A: I hope the Medicare prescription-drug benefit passes. People need coverage. Unfortunately, the political 
parties seem to have deadlocked on some pretty fundamental issues. So, we're hopeful there will be a House bill 
passed this year. But I think the chances in the Senate this year are rapidly approaching zero. 
Q: Investors have been shocked by the slowing growth in the pharmaceuticals industry. Is the slower growth here 
to stay? 
A: The industry's growth rate almost certainly is slowing from what we saw in the past year or two, but it's still 
growing at rates that will double markets every six or seven years. There's an enormous demand both from an 
aging population and unmet medical needs for prescription pharmaceuticals. 
Q: Do you expect more consolidation among large drug companies or acquisitions of biotech companies soon? 
A: The answer to both questions is yes. When major product patents start expiring, if there are not replacement 
products in the pipeline, companies face slower earnings growth [and] unhappy shareholders. One of the ways to 
accelerate growth is to merge with another company and achieve growth by the reduction of costs. 
Q: Thanks.

NEW YORK - Pfizer Inc. flashed its mettle in the first quarter, fuelled by sales of the world's top selling drug, 
cholesterol-reducing Lipitor, and assisted by continued merger savings. 
However, some wonder whether the No. 1 drugmaker can keep the momentum, especially as it faces even 
steeper competition against Lipitor and contenders for its impotence drug Viagra, as well as the petering out of 
savings related to its merger with Warner-Lambert Co. 
In the first quarter, Lipitor sales gains and cost of goods sold reductions drove three-quarters of the reported sales 
growth. 
Pfizer, though, disagrees, and points to its selling eight of the 30 top-selling medicines in the world; keeping trade 
inventory levels low; and anticipating additional merger-related savings after 2002. 
Yesterday, the New York drugmaker reaffirmed its projection of 2002 earnings between US$1.56 and US$1.60 a 
share and of double-digit revenue growth in 2002, 2003 and 2004. In 2003 and 2004, Pfizer said operating 
earnings per share should increase 15% or more. 
Pfizer said first-quarter net income rose more than 20% in the quarter to US$2.36-billion (US37 cents a share) 
from US$1.93-billion (US30 cents) a year ago. Excluding the impact from a change in an accounting principle and 
merger-related costs, earnings would have risen 18% to US39 cents a share -- matching analysts' consensus 
estimate -- from US33 cents a year ago. 
First-quarter revenue climbed 11% to US$8.42-billion from the year-earlier's US$7.58-billion, driven primarily from 
sales of its human pharmaceuticals, which jumped 13% to US$6.81-billion. Its nine key medicines generated 
more than 80% of the revenue and in aggregate, they grew 17%. 
Despite the strong quarter, Pfizer shares (PFE/NYSE) fell 5.14% yesterday after the pharmaceutical powerhouse 
lowered its second-quarter earnings expectations. Pfizer was also the most heavily traded stock on the Big Board, 
closing at US$37.85, down US$2.05. 
The main problem: guilt by association. In a crummy year, some drug companies slashed their earnings guidance 
big time. Still, some pros are giving this blue chip another look. Pfizer's got the broadest lineup of blockbusters of 
any major pharmaceutical company, little exposure to competition from generic drugmakers and an attractive 
pipeline -- rare commodities in a struggling sector. 
The company's US$244-billion market capitalization makes it the sixth-largest U.S. stock, according to Thomson 
Financial/First Call. 
And by some measures, the shares look really cheap. 
"It has the best balance of all the U.S.-based drug companies," sums up Norman Fidel, manager of the Alliance 
Health Care Fund. Pfizer is the fund's largest holding, comprising about 8% of its assets as of December 31. 
On the face of it, Pfizer confronts a common problem: a competitive threat to a top-selling drug.

Lipitor, which accounted for about 20% of Pfizer's US$32-billion in sales in 2001, will have to compete with 
Crestor, AstraZeneca PLC's new, so-called "super statin," if it is launched later this year. Crestor has produced 
strong results in clinical trials, so it threatens to take market share from Lipitor. 
But the cupboard is hardly bare; Pfizer markets seven of the world's top 25 selling drugs, including Norvasc for 
high blood pressure and Zoloft for depression. "You don't face the one-product risk you face with some other 
companies," says John Schaetzl, a portfolio manager at GE Asset Management. (GE held 20.2 million shares of 
Pfizer as of December 31, according to a spokesperson.) 
Pfizer's pipeline looks solid, too. 
It recently launched the arthritis drug, Bextra, with partner Pharmacia. It's awaiting Food and Drug Administration 
approval of the antifungal, Vfend, and the pulmonary medication, Spiriva (with partner Boehringer Ingelheim). And 
it has announced plans to file 15 new drug applications with the FDA between 2001 and 2006. 
Pfizer also could license products or acquire another company. 
Some on Wall Street speculate it might want to buy Pharmacia Corp. after Pharmacia spins off its Monsanto 
agricultural subsidiary later this year. 
Clearly, Pfizer can afford it: It had US$1.04-billion in cash on its balance sheet as of Dec. 31, and its long-term 
debt is only 12% of total capitalization. Pfizer is also among the elite companies that command a AAA debt rating. 
And though Pfizer's earnings growth will necessarily slow from its recent torrid pace (which included cost savings 
from the Warner-Lambert acquisition), the company reiterated last month that it should earn US$1.56 to US$1.60 
per share in 2002 -- at least a 19% gain over last year. And it expects growth of 15% or better in 2003 and 2004. 
"It's a very dependable mid- to high-teens earnings grower," says Mark Hesse-Withbroe, an equity research 
analyst at Victory Capital Management, a unit of KeyCorp. (About 2.5% of Victory's large-cap value portfolio is in 
Pfizer stock.) 
Yet the shares look attractively priced. At recent levels, Pfizer's shares changed hands at 24.5 times the US$1.59 
per share Wall Street expects it to earn this year, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. That's at the high 
end of the drug group and a premium to Pfizer's projected long-term earnings growth rate of 18%. 
But it's a discount to Pfizer's median multiple of 26.2 times projected earnings since 1992. Meanwhile, Pfizer is 
selling at just a 10% premium to the Standard & Poor's 500 index, the bottom of its range since 1996 and well 
below its median 60% premium to the market, according to Thomson Financial/Baseline. 
Pfizer's challenges? It's still coping with asbestos-related lawsuits and litigation over the diabetes treatment, 
Rezulin. Its allergy drug Zyrtec could be hurt by the introduction of over-the-counter Claritin. 
Also ahead, some analysts are concerned about how lucrative Viagra sales will be when competing medicine 
Cialis, of Eli Lilly & Co. and Icos Corp., and vardenafil, of Bayer AG and GlaxoSmithKline PLC, are approved and 
launched. 
But its industry-leading product portfolio, dependable earnings growth and reasonable valuation should 
overshadow those threats. And that could help Pfizer continue on the quest spelled out on the cover of its annual 
report: "to become the world's most valued company." 
In the United States, it has only General Electric Co., Microsoft Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
and Citigroup to beat.
