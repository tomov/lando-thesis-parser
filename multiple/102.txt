Wipro plans US$1bn sponsored ADR: reports 
Wipro Ltd. is set to launch a sponsored American Depository Receipts (ADR) offering that could possibly see the 
promoters and promoter group led by Azim Premji offloading some of their stake in India’s third-largest software 
exporter. The size of the issue could be above US$1bn. Over 5% of Wipro’s shares in the Indian market will get 
converted into ADRs. The move is positive for Wipro shareholders, as they will be able to sell their shares at a 
premium in the US market. In a sponsored ADR issue, the proceeds from the offering do not flow into the 
company’s books, but go to the shareholders. There is, hence, no fresh issue of equity by the company. However, 
the company backs the offering and gives its existing shareholders the opportunity to tender their shares to the 
ADR offering. Wipro ADR is trading at a substantial premium of 40-45% to local stock prices. Wipro chairman 
Azim Premji and his family together own 79.61% in the company, according to a filing made to the Bombay Stock 
Exchange (BSE) on December 31, 2009. In Feb. 2008, the Finance Ministry had proposed that public 
shareholding for listed companies be raised from the current 10% to 25%. 
Rishad Premji appointed Wipro's chief strategy officer 
Rishad Premji was appointed Chief Strategy Officer of Wipro. The 33-year-old elder son of Azim Premji, will 
report to the joint CEOs, Suresh Vaswani and Girish Paranjpe. The changes will be effective January 2011. 
However, Rishad will move into the strategy function from September 1. Rishad had a stint with a global 
consultancy firm in Europe before joining Wipro around three years ago. He is armed with an MBA degree from 
Harvard Business School. Wipro’s current chief strategy officer and M&A head of the IT business, 
Lakshminarayana K.R. (Lan), is taking over as the chief endowment officer of a trust set up to fund the 
philanthropic activities of Azim Premji. 
IT stocks slip as US hikes visa fees 
Shares of leading Indian IT companies slid after the US Senate passed a Border Security Bill that will raise the 
visa fees of Indian software companies operating in the US by more than US$200mn. IT stocks were also down 
because of mounting concerns over the health of the US economy. Indian IT companies get a major chunk of 
their revenue from the US economy. In addition, derogatory remarks by a US senator on Indian IT companies like 
Infosys has revived the specter of protectionism as unemployment still remains pretty high in America. 
The Border Security Bill, which was passed by the US senate last Thursday, will have a significant impact on the 
Indian IT vendors as it aims to raise about US$600mn by increasing fee for H-1B and L-1 visas. As per the bill, 
companies with less than 50% of local force have to pay an additional US$2,000 on H1B and L1 visas. Currently, 
H1B visas costs range between US$3,000-5,000, depending on the attorney and premium processing fees taken. 
NASSCOM says the Bill unfairly reduced competitiveness of Indian firms. "We believe this will have negative 
impact on Indian companies which are investing in US, employing US talent, driving US technological talent and 
are overall aiding the US economic recovery," it said. Leading IT firms termed the US Border Security Bill as 
"discriminatory" and expressed apprehensions over the impact of the hike on competitiveness of Indian firms. 
Infosys considers Europe acquisition: report 
Infosys Technologies is planning to consider acquisition in Europe, according to a report. B.G. Srinivas, senior 
Vice-President and member - executive council, Infosys Technologies Ltd has reportedly said that Europe in

Page 5 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
many ways is coming out of the recession, but still it is in a slow process. The report stated that the company's 
internal targets are organic; and if an acquisition happens, it is an add-on. 
Vodafone Essar signs contract with Wipro 
Vodafone Essar, one of India’s leading cellular service providers has signed contract with Wipro Ltd. As a part of 
this strategic engagement, Wipro will support Vodafone Essar with its fixed line telecom services for enterprise 
business customers. "We expect our partnership with Wipro to provide more value to our enterprise customers 
through increased operational efficiency and cost optimization. Through this partnership, we hope to bring an 
innovative approach to servicing the Enterprise telecoms market and also enhance our business revenues," said 
Naveen Chopra Director - Enterprise and Carrier Business, Vodafone Essar. 
Apax Partners, Carlyle in race for buying Patni 
Private equity firms Apax Partners LLP and Carlyle Group are locked in the battle to acquire majority stake in 
India's Patni Computer Systems Ltd., according to reports. The PE consortium of Carlyle Group and Advent 
International has reportedly roped in former Wipro vice-chairman Vivek Paul as a partner to lead their US$1bn bid 
for Patni. Paul would be investing through Akansa Capital - an investment company he launched after his 
departure from TPG Capital last year. He may join Patni’s board if they win the bid. Paul had quit his position as 
vice chairman of Bangalore-based Wipro Ltd., India’s third- largest computer-services provider, in 2005 to join 
TPG. The other bidder is iGate Corporation, which is backed by private equity firm Apax Partners. Apax and iGate 
are jointly bidding for the 45.9% stake held by Patni Chairman Narendra Patni, and his family, according to 
reports. A decision is expected as early as this month, the report said. Bidders want the Patni family to sign a 
no-compete agreement and a so-called representation and warranties contract that would help the buyers in case 
of any future liabilities, according to reports. Japan’s NTT Data Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd. had earlier 
considered deals involving Patni, according to media reports. General Atlantic holds a 17.5% stake in Patni 
through a mix of Indian shares and ADRs. 
Domestic News 
Azim Premji to transfer 213mn shares to trust 
Wipro chairman Azim Premji said he will give about Rs 88.46bn (about US$2bn) to improve school education in 
India. Premji, India's third richest man with a net worth of US$18bn, will transfer 213 million equity shares of 
Wipro, held by a few entities controlled by him, to the Azim Premji Trust from Dec. 7. It will fund educational 
activities of the Azim Premji Foundation (APF) which works mainly with schools in rural India. He had previously 
transferred over Rs 7bn crore to the APF. 
The 213mn equity shares amount to about 8.7% of Wipro's total outstanding shares held by entities controlled by 
Premji. Premji will transfer Rs 88.46bn worth of shares to the trust Azim Premji Foundation Pvt. Ltd. involved in 
nonprofit initiatives. The transfer will be effected by the end of December. Further, Wipro said the Company has 
been informed that the trust has been created to fund various social, not for profit initiatives, which are expected 
to scale significantly over the next few years. The trust is controlled by Premji, and he will continue to retain the 
voting rights of the transferred shares. 
The Azim Premji University is an ambitious project aiming to create a pool of education and development 
professionals and develop teacher educators and academic resource. The varsity will be set up soon on Sarjapur 
Road, close to the Wipro office, spreading across 75 acres. The university, offering post-graduate courses in 
education and development, will start with 200 students in 2011 and scale to 2,000 in 4-5 years. The foundation 
will also create district-level institutions with 50-70 people in each and these state and district resource centres 
will support improvement in education, especially in disadvantaged areas. The APF said it will continue to partner 
state governments (including continuing with its existing programmes), institutions, NGOs and individuals. 
AT&T exits from Tech Mahindra 
AT&T sold its entire 8.07% stake in Tech Mahindra a month after acquiring it from the Indian promoters. The US 
telecom major sold 7% stake in Tech Mahindra on April 28 and another 1% over the past few weeks in the 
market, thus making an exit from its stake in the software firm completely. The 7% stake was sold at Rs762.4 a 
share, giving AT&T Rs6.6bn and netting it a profit of around Rs5bn in a month's time. A bulk of the shares were 
purchased by LIC, according to reports. There was no official confirmation from any company. LIC already holds 
around 7.4% in Tech Mahindra, and the current transaction could take its stake up to 12-14%. AT&T had bought 
the Tech Mahindra stake in March 2010 by exercising an option it had to purchase the shares at US$3.5 a share

Page 6 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
or around Rs162 a share. AT&T acquired the right to exercise the options because it fulfilled certain revenue 
targets in terms of outsourcing contracts to Tech Mahindra 
Mindtree bags contract for UID project 
Mindtree shares rose after the company received an application development and maintenance services contract 
from "Aadhaar", previously known as unique identification (UID) project. The multi-year contract involves 
designing, developing, testing, maintaining and providing help desk services from the Unique Identification 
Authority of India (UIDAI) Bangalore technology centre, the company said in a filing with BSE. Financial details 
were not disclosed. "Aadhaar" will authenticate every Indian in terms of his or her identity based on bio-metric 
verification. With a massive information base of 1.2 billion people and the ongoing collection, validation, issue and 
constant verification of identity, project "Aadhaar" will require one of the most complex IT architectures ever 
created and a software implementation that would become a benchmark for years to come. 
SC cancels bail for Raju, five others in Satyam fraud case 
The Supreme Court cancelled bail granted to B. Ramalinga Raju and five others, all accused of involvement in 
the Satyam Computer Services Ltd accounting fraud, after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) told the court 
they were interfering with the investigation. The bench, comprising justices Dalveer Bhandari and Deepak Verma, 
gave Raju and the others until 8 November to surrender to the authorities. It also ordered that the trial in the lower 
court at Hyderabad be completed by 31 July 2011. Raju was granted bail by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in 
August after being taken into custody in January 2009, soon after he confessed to the '7,000 crore (now 
estimated at '14,000 crore) accounting swindle through which he inflated Satyam's profits and boosted its stock 
price. 
The court did not record its reasons for cancelling bail as this could prejudice the trial pending in the lower court, 
said additional solicitor general Harin P. Raval. "Though the Supreme Court does not normally interfere in bail 
cases, they are convinced that this is a fit case to interfere and they have cancelled bail," he said. The CBI 
submitted to the apex court that Raju was attempting to get rid of his assets in anticipation of his conviction in the 
case. This was in violation of a prohibitory order issued by the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) asking 
Raju and others to refrain from such activity. The CBI also contended that Raju was pressuring witnesses, many 
of whom were his former employees, to hold back crucial evidence that might further implicate him and the others 
accused in the case. 
Of the 19 months Raju spent in custody, he was hospitalised for about a year as he was reportedly diagnosed 
with a liver infection. The CBI said previously that Raju was faking his illness in an attempt to avoid jail time and 
conviction in the trial. Raju made an appearance in the Hyderabad trial court on 24 August, his first since last 
September, when he purportedly fell ill. Raju admitted to inflating profits that resulted in boosting the company's 
share price and enabled it to leverage credit from banks. The case against him, however, has carried the more 
serious charges of insider trading and embezzling public money on several counts. 
Glodyne promoters increase shareholding to 60.70% 
Glodyne Technoserve Ltd has increased their holding in the company by acquiring 4,33,000 equity shares from 
open market purchase.With the additional shares acquisition, the promoter holding in the company increases to

our robust business models and we have full confidence on the future growth of the Company. We believe in 
value creation for all our associates and are determined to make Glodyne as one of the best technology IMS 
Company in India”The Company has been consistently delivering strong performance and is on track to achieve

AT&T picks up 8% stake in Tech Mahindra 
AT&T International picked 8.07% stake in Tech Mahindra. AT&T acquired about ~9.87mn equity shares of Tech 
Mahindra in an off-market transaction at a price of Rs162 per share. AT&T had an option to acquire stake in Tech 
Mahindra subject to meeting certain revenue targets, according to an agreement signed between the two firms in 
2005. AT&T contributed the second highest business to Tech Mahindra accounting close to 15% of the latter’s 
total revenues, reports said. AT&T purchased the stake from Mauritius-based holding company MBT Mauritius. 
Hence, the deal value of US$34.5mn (approximately Rs1.6bn) will reflect in the accounts of MBT Mauritius. After 
the deal, MBT Mauritius now holds a negligible stake in Tech Mahindra. AT&T’s purchase of an 8% stake in Tech 
Mahindra is not likely to impact the Indian company’s shareholders, the Indian company said. Tech Mahindra 
management clarified that it was a one-off deal and there is no likelihood of more such transactions being carried 
out in the future. AT&T has long been a client of Mumbai-based Tech Mahindra.

NASSCOM said that software services and business process outsourcing (BPO) export revenues would touch 
US$49.7bn in 2009-10. The growth rate has been estimated at 5.5%, on the back of increased cost efficiencies,

healthier projections for exports at 13-15% and 15-17% for the India market. Worldwide technology products and 
services spend is estimated to cross US$1.5 trillion in 2009, a decline of almost 3%. On the hiring front, the 
industry remains bullish and is expected to be a net hirer, going ahead. "The industry, which will continue to 
remain a net hirer, added 90,000 jobs in 2009-10 and is expected to add almost 150,000 jobs next year," said 
NASSCOM chairman Pramod Bhasin. Direct employment in the Indian IT-BPO sector is estimated to cross 2.3 
million, while indirect job creation is estimated to reach 8.2 million. 
Siemens to hike India market share to 10%

Page 9 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
As it profits from ongoing growth in the emerging nations, Siemens is seeking to significantly expand its 
investment in India. Experts forecast that the Indian economy, for example, will grow seven percent in 2010 and 
eight percent the following year. "India is already one of the growth drivers worldwide and will remain so in the 
future. We’ve been optimally positioned here for over 140 years and intend to further strengthen our position," 
said Peter Löscher, President and CEO of Siemens AG in New Delhi, where the entire Siemens Managing Board 
met for the first time ever. Over the next three fiscal years through 2012, the company intends to invest more than 
€250 million in the country, thereby doubling its current annual investments. A major part of this will be invested in 
renewable energy and value-priced products business. The company also wants to increase its market share in

International News 
Worldwide IT spending to grow 4.6% in 2010: Gartner 
A slow but steady improvement in the macroeconomic environment in 2010 should support a return to modest 
growth in overall IT spending, according to Gartner, Inc. Worldwide IT spending will reach US$3.4 trillion in 2010, 
up 4.6% from 2009. Although modest, this projected growth represents a significant improvement from 2009, 
when worldwide IT spending declined 4.6%. All major segments (computing hardware, software, IT services, 
telecom, and telecom services) are expected to grow in 2010. "Last quarter, we did not expect to see IT spending 
levels recover to 2008 levels until 2011, however, now, with the upward revision to the current dollar forecast, we 
are projecting that global IT spending this year will approach the level seen in 2008," said Richard Gordon, 
research vice president at Gartner. "Our updated forecast for IT spending to reach US$3.4 trillion in 2010 is 
actually a year earlier than we expected leveling our previous forecast update, and reflecting a bounce back in 
underlying IT spending from the sharp drop in 2009." While, this forecast might seem bullish at first, it is important 
to factor in the impact that exchange rates will have on the markets, Gordon said. Much of the increase in our 
revised 2010 forecast can be attributed to a projected decline in the value of the US dollar compared to 2009, he 
added. 
SAP ordered to pay US$1.3bn to Oracle

Page 11 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
A jury in California awarded Oracle US$1.3bn in damages in its lawsuit against SAP over stolen software, 
deeming the German company liable for copyright infringement. Oracle had alleged a now-defunct SAP 
subsidiary stole and resold Oracles patent-protected software. SAP acknowledged the patent infringement, but 
disagreed with the extent of the damages to its US rival. Oracle claimed the unit, TomorrowNow, took thousands 
of customers with the stolen technology. The US$1.3bn verdict is the largest software infringement damages ever 
awarded. SAP assessed the damage to Oracle at around US$40mn. Oracle argued the cost was much higher 
once lost licence fees were taken into account. The costs related to the US federal jury decision won't have any 
impact on SAP's outlook, which doesn't take account of this type of charge, a spokesman for the German 
software company said. SAP is considering an appeal. 
Oracle gets EU nod for Sun Micro acquisition 
The European Commission approved Oracle Corp.'s acquisition of Sun Microsystems after the US database 
software titan addressed competition concerns about its acquisition of the open-source database MySQL, which 
Sun bought in 2008. Oracle said on Dec. 14 that it will boost investment in MySQL and is committed to keeping 
MySQL’s open-source licensing platform. "I am now satisfied that competition and innovation will be preserved on 
all the markets concerned," European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement in Brussels. 
"Oracle’s acquisition of Sun has the potential to revitalize important assets and create new and innovative 
products." With this, Oracle overcomes one of the last regulatory hurdles to the planned US$7.4bn transaction, 
though China and Russia still need to give their assent as well. US regulators approved the deal months ago. 
Oracle said that it expects to close the transaction shortly and has scheduled a conference call for next week on 
its strategy for Sun. 
HP to acquire Palm for US$1.2bn 
Hewlett-Packard said that it will acquire Palm in a deal valuing the struggling cellphone maker at US$1.2bn. 
Palm’s common shareholders will receive US$5.70 a share in cash, a 23% premium over the closing price, H-P 
said in a statement. Elevation Partners LP, Palm’s biggest investor, gets US$485mn for its preferred shares and 
warrants. Shares of Palm, 30% owned by Elevation Partners, jumped above HP's cash offer. Some investors 
could be betting on a higher bid, while others could be covering short positions on the heavily shorted stock. Both 
the boards have approved the deal, which includes debt. Based on Palm's latest filing, the deal values Palm's 
167.892 million shares outstanding at US$957mn. 
Palm has been struggling to boost sales in the lucrative smartphone market as consumers have shunned its 
latest launches even as rivals such as Apple and RIM have stepped up their presence. Speculation had been 
building up over the past few weeks over a possible takeover offer for Palm. Slow sales of Palm's latest 
smartphone models have depressed the stock, raising questions on the company's future prospects. Palm's 
chairman and chief executive, Jon Rubinstein, is expected to remain with the company. The transaction is 
expected to close during H-P's third fiscal quarter ending July 31. 
Global PC shipments rise 27.4%: Gartner 
Worldwide PC shipments totaled 84.3mn units in the first quarter of 2010, a 27.4% increase from the first quarter 
of 2009, according to preliminary results by Gartner, Inc. These first quarter results have exceeded Gartner's 
earlier market outlook. Gartner had been expecting first quarter PC shipments to grow 22%. "The 
stronger-than-expected growth was led by a robust recovery in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) PC 
market, which grew 24.8% in the first quarter of 2010," said Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner. "All 
other regions recorded double-digit growth rates, although the U.S. and Latin America were slightly lower than 
what we had expected." HP continued to be the leader in worldwide PC shipments, but its growth was below the 
worldwide average in the first quarter of 2010. HP faced continued pressure from its Asian rivals that are gaining 
share. 
SAP to buy Sybase for US$5.8bn 
SAP AG has agreed to buy Sybase Inc. for US$5.8bn, as the German enterprise software giant seeks to take on 
rival Oracle. SAP will make a tender offer for Sybase at US$65 a share, a 44% premium over the shares' 
thee-month average price. Sybase shares have historically never traded above US$55 a share on a split-adjusted 
basis, a mark they reached in 1994. The deal will be made using SAP's cash on hand, and a €2.75bn 
(US$3.47bn) loan facility. Sybase will operate as a standalone unit, and its management team will remain in 
place. In after-hours trading, Sybase shares rose 15% to US$64.65, while US-traded shares of SAP fell nearly 
1% to US$44.50. Shares of Sybase had surged earlier on May 12, following news report of the impending merger 
announcement.

Page 12 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"This is huge," SAP co-CEO Bill McDermott said during a conference call, adding that the merger is about 
accelerating growth for both businesses. Sybase's board has approved the merger, and the companies expect 
the deal to close in July, analysts say rival bids for Sybase could yet emerge. In addition to mobile and database 
technology, SAP is also gaining access to the financial services market in China. Sybase has partnered with SAP 
in the past, to provide business software to mobile devices. That partnership was announced in March of last 
year. 
Apple sells 1 million iPads in first month 
Apple said that it has sold more than one million iPads in a month, with sales of the touch-screen tablet device 
outpacing the first month sales for the iPhone by roughly two to one. Shares of Apple rose following the news. 
The stock is up more than 25% since the first of the year. The news also gave a boost to the shares of companies 
such as SanDisk and Micron Technology which make Flash memory chips used in devices such as the iPad. 
Apple released the WiFi version of the iPad on April 3, while the 3G version went on sale last Friday. iPad sales 
have already outstripped initial Wall Street estimates and the company is struggling to meet the high demand. 
Apple plans to launch the device in international markets later this month. Jobs said that demand continues to 
outpace supply and that the company is working hard to try to produce iPads at a faster rate. Apple also said that 
iPad users have downloaded more than 12 million apps from the company's App Store, as well as more than 1.5 
million e-books. 
Apple introduces iPhone 4 
Apple presented the new iPhone 4 featuring FaceTime, which makes the dream of video calling a reality, and 
Apple’s stunning new Retina display, the highest resolution display ever built into a phone, resulting in super crisp 
text, image, and video. In addition, iPhone 4 features a 5-megapixel camera with LED flash, HD video recording, 
Apple’s A4 processor, a 3-axis gyro, and up to 40% longer talk time - in a beautiful all-new design of glass and 
stainless steel that is the thinnest smartphone in the world. iPhone 4 comes with iOS 4, the newest version of the 
world’s most advanced mobile operating system, which includes over 100 new features and 1500 new APIs for 
developers. 
Google gets its licence back in China 
Looks like Google and China have buried their differences over the controversial issue of censoring Internet 
search results. Google said on Friday that the Chinese government has renewed it's licence after the company 
submitted a revised application to meet regulations in the world’s biggest Internet market by users. We are very 
pleased that the government has renewed our ICP license and we look forward to continuing to provide web 
search and local products to our users in China," Google said in a statement. Shares of Google rose in 
pre-market trading while that of its main Chinese rival Baidu.com slumped. In January, Google had warned that it 
might cease operating in China as it was not ready to censor users' search results. Two months later, Google 
began directing users of the China web site to its Hong Kong site, where they could access uncensored results. 
Google ended that redirection last week after the Chinese government objected to that practice.China had more 
than 384 million Web users at the end of 2009, according to government data. That is more than the population of 
the US 
H-P, Dell intensify bidding war for 3Par 
The bidding war for 3Par Inc. intensified further, with both Hewlett-Packard and Dell raising their takeover offers - 
with the latest bid valuing the small data storage company at US$2bn. Investors in 3Par cheered the news, 
driving the stock up more than 20% to US$31.26 - more than 4% above the highest bid price, signaling a hope for 
more offers. -P boosted its offer to US$30 per share just before the opening bell. That came just hours after Dell 
had raised its offer to US$27 to match H-P's previous offer. In a statement, 3Par said it has accepted Dell's raised 
bid, though that statement was issued before H-P moved up its own offer. Par had signed a deal last week to be 
acquired by Dell for US$18 per share. H-P announced an unsolicited bid of US$24 a share on Aug. 23. Early on 
Aug. 26, Dell raised its bid to US$24.30 per share, narrowly trumping H-P's offer. By the end of the day, H-P had 
boosted its own bid to US$27. 
Apple may unveil new iPod at Sept. 1 event: report 
Apple is holding an event next week where the company is widely expected to launch the updated version of its 
iPod digital music players besides a revamped version of Apple TV and changes to iTunes services. Apple has 
sent an invitation to select members of the media, according to reports. The special event will take place in San 
Francisco on September 1. The company has refused to share more details about the products that it plans to 
unveil at the event. Apple could announce the first iPod touch with a camera, an updated Apple TV with an App

Store, and iTunes changes, like a cloud-based iTunes service, according to one analyst. The iPod is now Apple's 
smallest product line in terms of revenue, behind the iPhone, Mac and iPad. Apple sold about 9.4 million iPod 
units during its June quarter - down 8% from the same period last year. 
HP CEO resigns on sexual harassment charges 
Mark Hurd, the high-profile chief executive officer (CEO) of US-based PC major Hewlett-Packard resigned on 
August 6 amid allegations of sexual harassment and violations of company's Code of Conduct. The charges of 
sexual harassment against Hurd and the company were leveled by a former marketing contractor, who is believed 
to have received numerous inappropriate payments from HP. The company's shares plunged in late trading after 
the announcement but recovered to trade little changed. HP said it had initiated the investigation on June 29 after 
the contractor made a claim of sexual harassment. The woman, who HP refused to identify, worked as marketing 
contractor for two years, the company said. Hurd repeatedly filed inaccurate expense account reports in a bid to 
keep the relationship with the contractor under wraps, HP said. 
IBM to acquire Netezza 
IBM will acquire Netezza Corp., a publicly held company in a cash transaction at a price of US$27 per share or at 
a net price of approximately US$1.7bn, after adjusting for cash. Netezza will expand IBM's business analytics 
initiatives to help clients gain faster insights into their business information, with increased performance at a lower 
cost. The acquisition, which is subject to Netezza shareholder approval, applicable regulatory clearances and 
other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2010. Netezza is a leading 
provider of high-performance analytics in a data warehousing appliance that can be up and running in a matter of 
hours, handling complex analytic queries 10 to 100 times faster than traditional systems. 
HP revises bid for 3PAR; Dell opts out of race 
HP will purchase 3PAR, a leading global provider of utility storage, through a cash tender offer of US$33 per 
share in cash, or an enterprise value of US$2.35bn. The transaction has been approved by the boards of both the 
companies. Dell announced that it will not increase its most recent proposal to acquire 3PAR, and that it has 
ended its discussions regarding a potential acquisition. Dell is entitled to receive a US$72mn break-up fee from 
3PAR upon the termination of its merger agreement. Dell’s final offer to acquire 3PAR was not accepted by 
3PAR’s board of directors. 
Apple unveils new iPods, Apple TV 
Apple introduced a new line up of its popular music players - iPods at its annual music-themed special event. 
CEO Steve Jobs also unveiled a social networking feature in the iTunes music store besides a revamped Apple 
TV device and updates to the operating system for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPads. The new iPod Touch will 
start at US$229. It is thinner and adds many of the new iPhone 4's features, including a front and rear facing 
camera, "Retina Display," and FaceTime, which allows users to make video calls over Wi-Fi. The iPod Touch is 
also the best selling portable game player, outselling Nintendo and Sony's portable game players combined, Jobs 
said.

The Microsoft Corp said that its chief software architect Ray Ozzie will step down following a tenure in which the 
Windows-maker lost ground to Google and Apple. Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has reportedly said that Ozzie 
would not be replaced, raising questions about the leadership and direction of the world's largest software 
company. Ozzie, who spearheaded Microsoft's move towards providing software and computing power over the 
Internet - known as "cloud computing" - had achieved what he set out to do. Ozzie took on the role of chief 
security architect in 2006, after Bill Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO to focus on his philanthropic work. 
Previously, he served as chief technical officer starting in 2005, after Microsoft purchased Groove Networks, 
which Ozzie founder in 1997. 
Microsoft unleashes Windows Phone 7 
Microsoft launched Windows Phone 7, its new operating system for mobile phones, in its bid to make a mark in 
the mobile handset market which is dominated by competitors, such as Apple, Research in Motion and phones 
that run on Google's Android OS platform. Windows Phone 7 will see the first devices launch on October 21 from 
major manufacturers including HTC, Samsung and LG. Windows Phone 7 handsets offer apps, games and 
integration with Microsoft services such as Xbox, Zune and Office. Each includes a fast Snapdragon processor 
and uses Live Tiles on the home screen - constantly updated squares delivering real-time information from social 
networks, the web, email and your calendar. All phones will be capable of playing games, and given the 
integration with Xbox LIVE, there will be a wealth of mobile arcade action to be unlocked. HTC is launching five 
Windows Phone 7 handsets, the HD7 along with the Surround, Mozart, Trophy and Pro. Samsung will launch 
Omnia 7 and LG , its Optimus 7 device. 
Yahoo to lay off 600 employees 
Yahoo said it would cut 4% of its workforce. Yahoo will lay off about 600 employees, mostly in its product group, 
and began notifying them on Dec. 14. The company will continue to hire globally to support key priorities. The 
cuts come nearly two years into the tenure of CEO Carol Bartz, who joined Yahoo in January 2009. The products 
group builds advertising products, Web properties like the company's popular news, sports and finance pages, as 
well as its widely used email service. Most of the jobs cut were in the US. The cuts were part of the Internet 
giant's multi-year effort to streamline operations and cut costs so it can focus on core Web properties and its 
display-advertising business. 
Google unveils laptops with Chrome OS 
Google exhibited the first laptops that will run on its Chrome OS operating system, using software to store 
applications and data on the web rather than a hard drive, resulting in much shorter boot-up times. The first 
Chrome OS computers will be sold by Acer and Samsung in 2011 and compete in the low-priced netbook market. 
Separately, Google opened an online e-book store in America. Google eBooks is a potential challenger to the 
dominance of Amazon and Apple in the digital-book market. Consumers can buy recent bestsellers and download 
free classic titles and read them on a number of devices, including the iPad, though not the Kindle. The service 
will be available in Europe and Asia next year.

Food for thought -- and action -- in India 
It's time for India's government to put its money where its mouth is. 
New Delhi has raised some $30 billion since March by selling state assets and telecom airwaves. That's about as 
much as the country will attract in foreign direct investment this fiscal year. 
There's one area above all else where this money should be directed: food security. New Delhi talks a lot about 
guaranteeing food for India's poor, but there's a need for smart investment to address fundamental problems. 
The neglect of farms poses a threat to India's economic future, not least through inflation. The persistence of 
double-digit increases in food prices earlier this year, regardless of weather, has made clear this is a structural 
problem. 
Meanwhile, lagging productivity in agriculture is contributing to income inequality. The sector employs 52% of 
India's work force but the farm economy is growing at a rate of less than 2% a year. That's half its rate of growth 
in the late 1980s and 1990s. Yet GDP growth in agriculture is at least twice as effective in reducing poverty, 
compared with similar growth in other sectors, the World Bank estimates. 
India's problems lie with infrastructure. A plan to target irrigation would be particularly compelling; 60% of India's 
farmland still depends on rainfall for its water needs. The Ministry of Agriculture's total annual budget, including 
spending on the development of such infrastructure, stands at just $4.6 billion, or 2% of India's annual budget. 
Building more storage capacity is equally important, so that millions of tons of food grain don't rot in open fields. 
The good news here is that foreign retailers, which would build their own cold-storage capacity, are eager to enter 
India. And government co-investment and tax incentives would go a long way toward speeding up investment. 
Building up research facilities and setting up education programs would be more fruitful than other handouts. For 
example, New Delhi subsidizes fertilizers, but fails to educate farmers on how to use them properly, resulting in 
lower crop yields. 
Successive governments have been criticized for not delivering on promises to make India's economic growth 
more inclusive and sustainable. They should use the recent financial windfall to change that. 
-- Harsh Joshi 
In Silicon Valley deals, 
some might like IT hot 
Technology titans have plenty of fight when it comes to deals. Witness the scrap between Hewlett-Packard and 
Dell over 3PAR, which pushed the storage firm's shares up more than threefold. But in 2010 such energy was 
mostly confined to small targets. Will 2011 herald a return to blockbuster deal-making? 
Just a few years ago, the likes of H-P, Oracle and Cisco Systems were largely specialty stores. But as they have 
expanded onto each other's turf, they are coming to resemble the IT equivalent of big-box retailers where chief 
information officers can get most of their shopping done. 
In their quest for growth, these vendors now want to gobble up as much of their clients' IT budget as possible. 
Gleacher & Co. analyst Brian Marshall argues it is necessary for them to sell software and services in addition to

enterprise hardware -- storage, servers and networking. To that end, Cisco and Oracle jumped into servers, 
Hewlett-Packard into networking. 
But many still have big gaps on their shelves, which could lead to further consolidation. 
Tempting for Oracle might be a services company like CSC. Facing stiff competition, and with heavy exposure to 
the U.S. government as a client, CSC isn't the most attractive option. But that contributes to its inexpensive

Down in Silicon Valley, Some Like IT Hot

Down in Silicon Valley, Some Like IT Hot

[Financial Analysis and Commentary] 
Technology titans have plenty of fight when it comes to deals. Witness the scrap between Hewlett-Packard and 
Dell over 3PAR, which pushed the storage firm's shares up more than threefold. But in 2010 such energy was 
mostly confined to small targets. Will 2011 herald a return to blockbuster deal-making? 
Just a few years ago, the likes of H-P, Oracle and Cisco Systems were largely specialty stores. But as they have 
expanded onto each other's turf, they are coming to resemble the IT equivalent of big-box retailers where Chief 
Information Officers can get most of their shopping done. 
In their quest for growth, these vendors now want to gobble up as much of their clients' IT budget as possible. 
Gleacher & Co. analyst Brian Marshall argues it is necessary for them to sell software and services in addition to 
enterprise hardware -- storage, servers and networking. To that end, Cisco and Oracle jumped into servers, 
Hewlett-Packard into networking. 
But many still have big gaps on their shelves, which could lead to further consolidation. 
Tempting for Oracle might be a services company like CSC. Facing stiff competition, and with heavy exposure to 
the U.S. government as a client, CSC isn't the most attractive option. But that contributes to its inexpensive 
valuation at around four times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. If Oracle's new 
operations guru Mark Hurd could boost CSC's 8% operating margin even some way towards the 16% at which 
he was running H-P's services business, returns on a deal could be substantial. 
Cisco, meanwhile, might like EMC, not only because of the firm's leadership in high-end storage, but also for its 
80% stake in VMware. Cisco already has a 2% stake in the latter and works closely with both companies on 
technology integration. 
VMware is growing fast, 18% annually through 2012 estimate analysts. That is double Cisco's growth rate. Its 
virtualization software is all the rage since, by converting individual servers into multiple "virtual" servers, it lets 
companies run existing gear closer to capacity, saving money. That said, a deal is a long shot, considering the 
price tag could top $60 billion. And it would dilute shareholders heavily. Cisco's net cash hoard of $24 billion is 
mostly held overseas, so a deal would have to be financed largely with Cisco stock, which, at 15 times next year's 
earnings, is selling far cheaper than EMC's 21 times. 
Still, as an avenue for growth, it would be more direct than Cisco's forays into Flip video cameras and cable 
set-top boxes. Oracle, which itself lags behind in storage and virtualization, might also have interest. Plus, its 
stock looks a solid acquisition currency at the moment, trading at a tidy 20 times earnings. 
For its part, H-P might look at big software acquisitions. Some have even whispered about a potential tie-up with 
Oracle competitor SAP. H-P CEO Leo Apotheker knows SAP well, having previously led the company. Yet with a 
market capitalization two-thirds as large as its own, H-P would be betting the farm. Alternatively, Cowen analyst 
Gregg Moskowitz thinks Citrix Systems might appeal, due to its growing virtualization business. 
Another candidate might be Symantec, a leader in security and storage software, which sports a valuation of nine 
times next year's free cash flow -- low relative to many software companies. 
As sales growth slows, watch for signs that the Wal-Marts and Costcos of IT are feeling the pressure to gobble up 
ever-larger rivals.

2010: Year of the Cloud 
Plugged In 
TECHNOLOGY WEEK 
2010: Year of the Cloud 
By Mark Veverka

(c) 2010 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
One of my new year's resolutions for 2011 is to refrain from punishing you forgiving readers with cloud-related 
puns. 
But I suspect that promise will be kept about as well as my annual vow to drop 20 pounds and ride my Italian 
bicycle up the switchbacks of Northern California's Mount Diablo. 
Indeed, the cloud story has been a lightning rod (there I go again, but it's still 2010). Critics have accused me of 
hyping cloud computing as if it were another dot-com bubble, practically declaring me the second coming of 
Henry Blodget (no offense, Henry). Others have applauded my ambition in trying to tackle such a vague yet 
complex trend, while accusing me of neither understanding nor adequately explaining the endless delineations of 
this subject -- such as infrastructure as a service, versus software as a service, versus platform as a service. You 
get the idea. 
But I tried. And I will keep trying, as we are only in the first inning of this very long game: the transition from 
client-server computing to cloud-based computing. In cover stories and columns, I chipped away at what this 
means to the industry and investors. It is the biggest shift in information technology since personal computers 
were tethered to servers some 15 years ago. 
One baby step in this transformation has been the consolidation of corporate data centers -- the heart of 
computer networks -- through the widespread adoption of virtualization software. That continues to fuel VMware 
shares (ticker: VMW) which, at a recent 88.38, more than doubled this year. 
In 2010, corporations drastically reduced the number of data centers they operate, producing critical savings 
during these lean economic times. In many cases, these data-center reconfigurations were the creation of "private 
clouds," or what some call "internal clouds" -- centralized computing networks distributed over the Internet behind 
secure firewalls. 
Chief technology officers were so smitten with these IT cost reductions that they ambitiously tested one-off 
projects in the public cloud-computing operations run offsite by a third party, such as Amazon.com's (AMZN) Web 
Services unit. At the other end of the spectrum, practically every mobile software-application startup seemed to 
outsource to public-cloud providers. 
Meanwhile, the incumbent behemoths fought ferociously for acquisitions they hoped would turn them into 
one-stop suppliers for data-center consolidation and adoption of private clouds. The peak of the feeding frenzy 
came with Hewlett-Packard's (HPQ) autumn blood match with Dell (DELL), which ended with HP's deal to buy 
3Par (PAR) for nearly three times the $9.65 a share that 3Par fetched before Dell's bid. 
HP accomplished that deal without a permanent chief executive due to the forced resignation of Mark Hurd, who 
eventually landed as a co-No. 2 at Oracle (ORCL). (No look back at 2010 would be complete without mention of 
his dicey ouster and the subsequent drama between Oracle CEO Larry Ellison and HP's board.) 
The biggest head-scratcher had to be Intel's (INTC) August purchase of antivirus maker McAfee (MFE) for $7.68 
billion, roughly a 60% premium. The giant chip maker, which last week got U.S. antitrust clearance for the deal, 
wants to expand into security and software. We wish Intel good luck with that, and good luck to the rest of us in 
the coming year.

Interim Management Report 
The half year to 31 October 2010 saw markets fall modestly, with a strong 
conclusion to the period proving insufficient to offset earlier weakness. The 
FTSE World index fell 0.7% in Sterling terms over the period. Sterling-based 
returns were hampered by Dollar weakness (-4.4% against the Pound) although this 
was offset by the rise in the Yen (+10.5%) which prompted intervention by the 
Bank of Japan in early October. Although markets ended the previous financial 
year at near twelve month highs, a slew of negative top down developments early 
in the fiscal year saw equities and risk appetite fall sharply. Whilst the 
escalation of the sovereign debt crisis facing Greece and others was met 
forcefully by the ECB with a Euro750bn bailout plan, ongoing Euro weakness 
suggests that investors remain unconvinced that weaker Eurozone economies would 
escape contagion. Additional negatives such as the oil spill in the Gulf of 
Mexico, ongoing tightening of financial market regulations and Chinese efforts 
to dampen asset price inflation added materially to the gloom. Fears about the 
recovery trajectory were augmented by a clear deterioration of US macroeconomic 
data in June and July as US labour markets failed to improve. 
Whilst some alleviation of the sovereign risk issue in Europe and a strong 
second quarter earnings season allowed shares to stage intermittent rallies, the 
trend remained to the downside as plunging US Treasury yields reflected the risk 
associated with a faltering recovery. The downward revisions to US GDP, weak 
payroll and housing data likely prompted Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, to state he 
was ready to use 'unconventional measures... if the outlook (were) to 
deteriorate'. This verbal intervention marked a clear watershed during the half 
year as the possibility of a further round of quantitative easing saw investor 
sentiment and markets rebound sharply, aided by a pick-up in M&A activity, the 
anticipated Republican gains in the mid-term elections and a third-quarter

earnings season that came in ahead of expectations. 
Technology shares modestly trailed the broader market with the Dow Jones World 
Technology index falling 2.5% over the half year in Sterling terms. While some 
of the sector's underperformance was passive (reflecting the underperformance of 
US equities and the Dollar), technology's relative performance peaked in 
April/May concurrent with US Treasury yields/growth expectations. Deteriorating 
macroeconomic conditions definitely left their mark as investors began to 
question the accuracy of 2011 earnings estimates, particularly in the most 
cyclically exposed sub-segments such as semiconductors. In addition, PC related 
shares performed poorly as evidence of order cancellations early in the period 
were followed in August by an Intel profit warning and the surprise departure of 
Mark Hurd, the highly regarded CEO of Hewlett Packard. Furthermore, the stunning 
debut of Apple's iPad made plain the risk posed to the PC market by alternative 
computing devices such as tablets. A number of other large-caps shares also 
lagged the market as a combination of structural (Nokia, Microsoft) and cyclical 
(Cisco) headwinds made them look like 'growth cyclicals' at best. 
In contrast, our own net asset value per share rose by 5.7% over the same period 
as small and mid-cap technology stocks materially outperformed over the half 
year due to a combination of superior earnings growth, relative PER multiple 
expansion (scarcity of growth) and surging M&A activity. Both second and 
third-quarter earnings seasons made plain the widening gulf between legacy and 
next-generation companies. Outstanding returns from new cycle standard bearers 
such as F5 Networks (+64% share price return in Sterling terms), Riverbed (+77%) 
and Salesforce.com (+29%) were in stark contrast to more pedestrian performances 
from the likes of IBM and SAP. Next generation companies also benefited from a 
significant pick up in M&A activity which began in May with SAP's acquisition of 
Sybase followed by further transactions in August and September (Intel/McAfee, 
HP/3PAR, IBM/Netezza, HP/Arcsite). This confirmed our view that a new technology 
cycle was firmly underway and this was epitomised by Hewlett Packard's 
acquisition of storage vendor 3PAR following a bidding war with Dell. 
Whilst we are encouraged by the Federal Reserve's rhetoric and believe that it 
is committed to eliminating the worst-case deflationary outcome, we still see 
little to challenge our long held view that the developed world is likely to 
experience a multi-year period of sub trend growth as the impact of deleveraging 
becomes apparent. We still believe that equity markets can continue to make 
positive progress over the coming half year given undemanding valuations and a 
further round of QE in the US but acknowledge that risks to this view are 
increasing as governments are increasingly forced to deliver on their fiscal 
commitments. With this in mind we expect monetary policy to remain extremely 
accommodative in the developed world, even as central banks in emerging markets 
have begun to adopt more neutral stances in order to manage the balance between 
growth and inflationary pressures. Although the risk of a policy error appears 
to have risen, we still expect the global economy to muddle through, aided by 
the absence of structural inflation in the developed world due to excess 
capacity and high unemployment. 
As well as the risks outlined above, there are a number of additional risk 
factors that investors should consider. These include sovereign default risk, 
[ 13-12-10 0700GMT ] 
further deterioration in labour and housing markets resulting in a so-called 
'double-dip', and insufficient political will to deliver on fiscal tightening 
commitments resulting in a loss of market confidence. Longer-term risks remain 
unchanged and are based on the structural imbalances that remain largely 
unresolved. Other risks that could affect our thesis include premature interest 
rate hikes, a disorderly US Dollar decline, rapidly rising food and energy 
prices and rising protectionism. As in previous years, political risk remains

Page 24 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
the most significant exogenous factor to consider. 
Turning to technology, we continue to believe that sub-trend global growth 
should continue to provide a positive backdrop for the technology sector, as it 
should result in greater corporate focus on delivering productivity. Valuations 
relative to the wider market appear undemanding, especially given the sector's 
vastly superior aggregate balance sheet. Recent corporate action is also 
supportive with a number of companies issuing debt or using retained cash to 
announce significant buybacks and/or dividend hikes. Likewise, the return of 
private equity driven M&A has further stimulated interest in technology stocks. 
While IT budget growth is likely to remain subdued in 2011, we suspect that 
value creation will become increasingly uneven going forward as the deflationary 
impact of the new cycle continues to take its toll. This will likely drive 
greater competition between the technology behemoths of today, a dynamic being 
accelerated by the re-centralisation of computing. 
As such, we believe the recent acceleration in M&A activity is best understood 
as incumbents retooling for a new cycle which is why we have continued to 
de-emphasise our exposure to 'cheap' large cap legacy companies that have much 
to lose from a disruptive new cycle. Instead we continue to prefer next 
generation companies with little to lose and much to gain. Although these 
companies trade at higher forward PEs, they have been able to deliver organic 
growth somewhat independent of cyclical tailwinds and/or financial engineering. 
Now that cyclical recovery and cost cutting have stopped obfuscating the new 
cycle, we expect this superior growth trajectory to continue to support premium 
valuations, not least because we expect the recent acceleration in M&A activity 
to persist. Having 'lost' a number of holdings over the half year to 
acquisition, we expect this dynamic to continue to deliver value as incumbents 
shamelessly attempt to reinvent themselves. 
We continue to believe that we remain in the early stages of a disruptive new 
cycle that is based on three key drivers - the shift towards 'cloud computing' 
(described at length in last year's annual report), growth in broadband 
applications and the advent of ubiquitous computing. We will continue to move 
the portfolio away from our index as and when we anticipate large cap 
impairment. We remain as convinced as ever about the potential of this new cycle 
and expect the next phase to be characterised by continued small and mid-cap 
outperformance.

Risks and uncertainties 
The Directors consider that the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the 
group for the remaining six months of the financial year, which could have a 
material impact on performance, are consistent with those outlined in the annual 
report for the year ended 30 April 2010. 
These principal risks can be summarised as market volatility, stock pricing and 
liquidity risk, currency and interest rate risk, counterparty risk, differing 
economic cycles between different markets and risk inherent in technology, such 
as obsolescence and consumer acceptance of changes. 
The investment manager's report comments on the outlook for market related 
risks, including the increased volatility in share prices and economic cycles. 
The Company has a risk management framework that is a structured process for 
identifying, assessing and managing the risks associated with the Company's 
business. The investment portfolio is diversified by geography which mitigates

Page 25 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
risk but is focused on the technology sector and has a high proportion of 
investments listed on US markets or exposed to the US Dollar. 
Responsibility Statement 
The Directors of Polar Capital Technology Trust plc, which are listed in the 
Shareholder Information Section, confirm to the best of their knowledge: 
* The condensed set of financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with IAS34 as adopted by the European Union and give a true and fair view of 
the, financial position of the Company and the Group as at 31 October 2010 and 
the results for the six months ended 31 October 2010 as required by the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules 4.2.4R; 
* The Interim Management Report (constituting the investment manager's report) 
includes a fair review of the information required by the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules 4.2.7R. 
The half year financial report for the six month period to 31 October 2010 has 
not been audited or reviewed by the Auditors. 
The half year financial report for the six month period to 31 October 2010 was 
approved by the Board on 10 December 2010 and the responsibility statement was 
signed on its behalf by Richard Wakeling, Chairman of the Board. 
Related Party Transactions 
In accordance with DTR 4.2.8R there have been no new related party transactions 
during the six month period to 31 October 2010 and therefore nothing to report 
on any material effect by such transactions on the financial position or 
performance of the Company during that period. There have been no changes in any 
related party transaction described in the last annual report that could have a 
material effect on the financial position or performance of the Company in the 
first six months of the current financial year

A giant cut down to a value-sized price; After a messy CEO change and a spate of expensive 
acquisitions, investors have driven down HP shares. But this heavyweight tech company may yet bring 
buyers a quick buck

Hewlett-Packard Co. has given investors plenty to worry about in recent weeks, from a couple of expensive 
acquisitions to a left-field pick to replaced fired chief executive officer Mark Hurd. 
The resulting angst has served to drive down the shares into value territory. And that sets up investors for a nifty 
short-term gain even if HP never again trades like a darling of the tech industry. 
The turmoil at HP began in August when the board dismissed Mr. Hurd for violations of the company's code of 
conduct without naming an in-house candidate as successor. Shortly afterward, the company conducted an 
expensive bidding war with Dell Inc. for 3Par Inc., winning the data storage firm for a hefty price equivalent to 180 
times 3Par's earnings. 
HP followed with another expensive acquisition, this time of ArcSight, a company that produces computer security 
software, before surprising the markets late last month by appointing Léo Apotheker, former CEO of the German 
software company SAP AG, as its new chief. 
The hiring of the multilingual software veteran, who served as CEO of SAP for barely two years before being 
excused a few months ago, failed an apparent all-star test. CNBC personality Jim Cramer, who influences 
markets despite his periodic buffoonery, likened Mr. Apotheker to a double-A-level minor-league baseball player – 
someone, not one, but two steps away from the majors. 
The result of the negativity is a stock that has “the dubious distinction of possessing one of the lowest valuations 
of any major technology company,” says Gleacher & Co. analyst Brian Marshall. At around $43 (U.S.) a share, 
HP trades for just eight times estimated 2011 earnings, Mr. Marshall estimates. He has a “buy” rating and a $50 
target price on the stock. 
While the CEO shuffle and expensive acquisitions have dimmed investor enthusiasm, HP's biggest challenge 
may be its sheer size. Most acquisitions barely register on a company of its scale. Significant growth is hard to 
come by. 
With $123-billion in revenue in the past 12 months, HP posts more sales to its top line than Microsoft and Dell 
combined. Several pieces of HP would each make a fair-sized public company on their own. Its personal 
computer business, for instance, racked up $40-billion in sales in the past 12 months, while its printer business 
posted $25-billion. Its enterprise services business, which consults on large-scale corporate computer systems, 
added another $35-billion. 
Given the company's size, HP's acquisition binge looks far more modest than initial impressions might suggest. 
While the deals to buy 3Par and ArcSight were unquestionably pricey, their combined $3.8-billion purchase price 
represents just three months of cash flow for HP, notes analyst Ben A. Reitzes of Barclays Capital. 
And each of the acquired companies helps HP in areas it needs to grow in. Like other tech giants with a 
significant business clientele, HP is focused on being a one-stop destination for companies in need of integrated

hardware and software systems, plus all associated services. IBM, Oracle and EMC are each vying for a piece of 
the same pie. 
While HP is among the top three firms in services, it lags in storage and servers (14 per cent of revenue) and 
software (under 3 per cent of revenue). Margins and profits in those areas easily exceed those in HP's 
consumer-oriented businesses of printers and personal computers. 
Success in high-margin corporate markets would boost HP's bottom line, but it will take a lot to move the needle 
given the company's size. Some analysts fear a spate of pricey acquisitions similar to the last two will drag down 
HP's profits. Others simply think HP can't keep pace. 
The analyst team at UBS, which has a neutral rating and a $44 target price on HP, notes that the S&P 500 trades 
at 12 times earnings, but expects the aggregate earnings of the index to grow at 15 per cent. Since the UBS team 
pegs HP's growth rate at a lacklustre 7.4 per cent, they think investors should pay no more than nine times 
earnings. 
Even Gleacher's Mr. Marshall acknowledges the concern. “Due to absolute size, limited growth potential and a 
dependence on commoditized hardware offerings, we believe HP deserves to trade at a discount to the S&P 500 
and its peers.” However, he believes an appropriate price-to-earnings multiple is 10, which would suggest that HP 
is a $50 stock. For investors looking for a short-term gain, HP is more attractive than the recent negativity would 
suggest.

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — The tech M&A fever spewed more heat Wednesday as shares of Brocade 
Communications rose sharply on speculation of a potential buyout deal with IBM Corp. 
Brocade shares were up 61 cents, or 10.8%, to close at $6.26 on rumors, including a couple reported in Barron’s, 
that Big Blue was considering acquiring the networking gear maker that has long been considered to be a 
potential target. 
Some analysts reached by MarketWatch downplayed a possible IBM-Brocade marriage, but noted that it 
definitely is buying season for major tech players hoping to boost their product portfolios at a time when the lines 
in the data center market are blurring. 
Wedbush analyst Kaushik Roy said Brocade is surely an attractive acquisition target, but sees Dell Inc. as the 
more motivated buyer. 
“It makes a lot more sense for Dell to buy Brocade than IBM,” he said in an interview. “With Dell, it’s a no-brainer. 
If Dell has half of a brain, they should be taking Brocade out right now.” 
That’s because, of the big tech players vying for a piece of lucrative corporate space, Dell still has a relatively 
weak product portfolio, especially in networking and data storage. 
Gleacher & Co.’s Brian Marshall echoed this view, saying Brocade “is clearly a target asset,” adding, “I would be 
surprised if nothing happens over the next six months, potentially sooner.” 
Meanwhile, he added, Dell is “strategically and secularly challenged with their current portfolio.” 
“Brocade makes sense for them because they would gain more storage assets and a footprint in the ethernet 
networking market,” he said in an phone interview. 
Roy of Wedbush argued that if IBM goes for Brocade, “Dell should bid for it too.” 
And it’s partly because Big Blue will likely balk at a heated bidding war, as demonstrated by its decision not to 
pursue Sun Microsystems after Oracle Corp. made it move. 
H-P unlikely to step in 
In other words, IBM is unlikely to do what Hewlett-Packard did when it outbid Dell for 3Par, and ended up paying 
$2.35 billion, or more than three times the market value of the small data-storage player. 
“H-P was reckless,” Roy argued. “But IBM is not going to be reckless. If Dell goes after [Brocade], I think Dell has 
a shot.” 
H-P itself was rumored to be eyeing Brocade last year, but ended up buying 3Com. The company has been the 
most acquisitive of the big tech players recently, even as it looks for a new CEO and recovers from the scandal 
over ex-chief Mark Hurd’s sudden departure.

Page 65 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Shortly after closing the 3Par deal, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company said it was paying $1.5 billion to buy 
security software company ArcSight. 
IBM itself just inked a deal to buy Netezza Corp. for $1.7 billion. 
RBC Capital’s Amit Daryanani also didn’t think IBM would move on Brocade, citing the company’s emphasis on 
software and services. 
“Acquiring an asset like Brocade would be against that philosophy,” he said in an interview. 
He also was not sure Dell would want to go for a company with heavy exposure in networking, given H-P’s bid to 
expand in that space. 
“Given that H-P has made a very aggressive move in the networking market, the expectation is that gross 
margins in networking would trend down,” he said in a phone interview. And such a trend, he added, “would make 
acquisitions in that space less attractive.” 
Instead, Daryanani said Dell will probably focus more on data storage and services. 
Oracle another player? 
Meanwhile, Marshall of Gleacher & Co. identified another potential Brocade suitor: Oracle. 
The Redwood City, Calif.-based company has aggressively moved beyond its core database software business, 
expanding into business applications and even hardware with its purchase of Sun. 
“Public enemy No. 1 for Oracle is IBM,” Marshall said, adding gobbling up Brocade could make sense, he added, 
“if Oracle wanted to mess with IBM.” 
One tech behemoth that has recently stayed on the sidelines in the buying spree is Cisco Systems. 
“Cisco has been silent a little bit,” Roy of Wedbush said. “But they could get active. This is a good time. Cisco 
cannot buy Brocade because of antitrust issues. But they’re not shy. They’ll strike if and when they see an 
opportunity.” 
Brocade shares jump on rumor of IBM buyout as tech merger fever rages. Analysts see Dell as more likely buyer.

IBM CEO Sam Palmisano has criticised HP's pricey acquisition strategy which he says it is pursuing to 
compensate for massive cuts in R&D and revealed that it is Oracle he is monitoring more closely. 
During a rare public flogging of a rival, IBM's big cheese also criticised HP's handling of CEO Mark Hurd's exit 
last month when it paid the disgraced executive a severance package worth $35m, claiming it was a poor use of 
shareholder funds. 
Palmisano told the WSJ: "HP used to be a very inventive company." 
This was a nod to the $2.8bn HP shelled out on R&D in fiscal 2009 compared to $3.5bn it invested in 2005 when 
Hurd joined the business, compared to 6% of revenues or $5.8bn from IBM last year. 
Palo Alto-based HP recently forked out $2.4bn for 3PAR after a closely fought price war with Dell, paying more 
than three times the closing stock price for the storage firm before initial advances were made by Dell. 
It then followed that up earlier this week with a $1.5bn acquisition of ArcSight. 
During Hurd's five-year tenure, HP also splashed out $13.9bn on EDS, $2.7bn on 3Com and $1.2bn on Palm. 
Palmisano also crowed about IBM's decision to quit the PC market in 2005 before it descended further into a 
commoditised market, the opposite direction taken by HP which acquired Compaq in 2001 and is today the 
world's largest vendor. 
"We wanted to get out before it was obvious to everyone," said Palmisano, "I couldn't give it away today." 
However, praise was reserved for Oracle - with whom IBM battled it out for the signature of Sun Microsystems 
and has of late fallen out with HP - which he suspects will be its major rival in the long run. 
"Oracle invests," he said. 
Indeed it does, 12% of revenues or $3.2bn in fiscal 2010. Perhaps Palmisano has reason to look over his 
shoulder at the software giant, especially when the former Sun channel gets fully up to speed.

HEARD ON THE STREET: Big Blue's R&D Machine Benefits Shareholders 
HEARD ON THE STREET: Big Blue's R&D Machine Benefits Shareholders 
By Rolfe Winkler 
A DOW JONES COLUMN

Robbing Peter (the researcher) to pay Paul (the investor) can end up costing Paul in the long run. Or so argues 
Sam--as in International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) CEO Samuel Palmisano, who last week criticized rival 
Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) for underinvesting in research. 
H-P's former chief, Mark Hurd, paid investors by doubling operating profit margins during his tenure, but he did 
so partly at the expense of research and development. The R&D budget stagnated as revenue doubled. 
IBM's R&D budget has stayed around 6% of revenue for years and currently runs about $6 billion annually, twice 
H-P's. Still, since 2005, operating margin has expanded smartly to 20% from 14%. 
Though the benefits of R&D aren't easily measured, one may be flexibility. Take storage. IBM dodged recent 
bidding wars, according to Robert Morris, vice president of IBM Research, because its R&D operation gave the 
company insight to invest earlier, and cheaper, than rivals. 
A 2008 purchase of Israeli company Diligent, for an undisclosed price, gave IBM the technology to make storage 
more efficient. A year later, NetApp (NTAP) and EMC Corp. (EMC) fought to acquire Diligent's rival, Data Domain, 
with EMC prevailing for $2.1 billion. 
Also thanks to strong R&D, IBM avoided another high-profile bidding war at the high end of the storage 
market--over 3PAR. IBM already had a strong presence there, thanks to products developed internally. H-P, 
meanwhile, lacked a higher-end product. Its fight with Dell Inc. (DELL) over 3PAR was meant to fill that hole in its 
storage portfolio. But to secure its quarry, H-P ultimately paid $2.4 billion, a hefty 10 times revenue. 
H-P is strong in the middle tier of the storage market. But here, too, Big Blue's R&D machine may make inroads. 
The company will soon announce new internally developed products that will prove "surprisingly compelling," 
argues Steve Duplessie, a senior analyst at research firm Enterprise Strategy Group. 
IBM is just as acquisitive as rivals, of course, so R&D certainly isn't its only growth driver. And yet, if the 
company's experience in storage is any guide, its stable of engineers and scientists will continue to benefit 
shareholders.

H-P to Buy ArcSight for $1.5 Billion

H-P to Buy ArcSight for $1.5 Billion

Hewlett-Packard Co. agreed to buy security-software maker ArcSight Inc. for about $1.5 billion, continuing the 
company's spending spree that began after Chief Executive Mark Hurd resigned last month. 
The deal also represents the latest purchase of a smaller security firm by a huge technology company, a trend 
some see continuing as big tech considers the importance of adding security to their product portfolio. ArcSight 
makes software that monitors corporate networks for unusual activity, such as a hacker's attempt to break into a 
system. 
ArcSight shares ended Monday trading up 25.1% at $43.91 on the Nasdaq, above H-P's offer price of $43.50 a 
share, suggesting some traders may be expecting or hoping for a higher bid, similar to what happened with 
storage maker 3PAR Inc. last month. ArcSight, of Cupertino, Calif., had been quietly shopping itself to a handful 
of big technology companies, and the agreed-upon deal provides a 24% premium to ArcSight's closing price 
Friday and a 70% premium to where it was trading a month ago. 
On a conference call with investors, H-P executives declined to comment about the bidding process for ArcSight. 
They also wouldn't speculate about what would have happened if Mr. Hurd remained CEO. 
H-P expects the acquisition to close by the end of the calendar year and doesn't see any material earnings 
dilution in its next fiscal year. The company is in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2010 year. H-P shares, down 26% 
so far this year, added 2 cents to reach $38.22 in recent trading. 
"The combination of H-P and ArcSight will provide clients with the ability to fortify their applications, proactively 
monitor events and respond to threats," said Bill Veghte, H-P's executive vice president of software and solutions. 
The ArcSight deal continues H-P's push into software and other areas outside of its core computer-hardware 
businesses that began under Mr. Hurd. Software, networking, storage and services—all areas in which H-P has 
expanded recently—have higher margins than the company's core personal-computer and server-system 
businesses. H-P executives have said repeatedly that the company will continue the expansion strategy. 
Mr. Veghte reiterated that sentiment Monday, saying H-P has "a very clear and good M&A strategy" that's 
unchanged since Mr. Hurd's departure. 
"The company continues to make acquisitions where they make strategic operational and financial sense," Mr. 
Veghte said. 
The deal for ArcSight is the latest episode in a month-long drama starring H-P. Last month, Mr. Hurd resigned 
following violations of the Palo Alto, Calif., company's code of business conduct, and he later joined H-P rival 
Oracle Corp. as co-president. Shortly following Mr. Hurd's departure, H-P launched a bidding war with Dell Inc. for 
3PAR, eventually winning with a bid of $2.35 billion, almost double the amount Dell had initially agreed to pay. 
Investors have been concerned about H-P's strategy—including the high premiums it's paying for 
acquisitions—since Mr. Hurd left the company. 
"While such an acquisition would fit into the company's overall enterprise strategy, we believe Street sentiment 
would likely rather see the company get a new CEO announcement behind them and look to digest some of the 
acquisitions it has recently or will be completing (i.e., 3Com, Palm, 3PAR)," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Aaron C. 
Rakers said in a research note Monday.

Page 69 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Others noted the deal continues a wave of consolidation in the information technology sector. Last month, chip 
maker Intel Corp. offered to buy security specialist McAfee Inc. for $7.7 billion. 
Security companies have attracted interest from larger information-technology providers lately as the industry's 
biggest companies look to offer a wider variety of products and give customers an end-to-end solution. Software 
that helps companies manage data securely is especially in demand. 
H-P's Mr. Veghte said on a conference call that customers are not only looking for software products but also for 
services and hardware around the software to "deliver coherent solutions." He said H-P's acquisition of ArcSight 
will allow it to provide its enterprise clients with "holistic and proactive" solutions to manage their security risks 
and stay compliant with regulations at lower costs. 
Meanwhile, Jefferies analyst Katherine Egbert noted seven other security companies that could attract interest 
from larger tech companies. They were: Sourcefire Inc., Fortinet Inc., Vasco Data Security International Inc., 
Symantec Corp., Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., Blue Coat Systems Inc. and Websense Inc. 
The analyst added, though, "we do not believe any of these vendors are an active target right now." 
Vasco and Check Point declined to comment, while representatives from Sourcefire, Fortinet, Blue Coat and 
Websense weren't immediately available to comment.

IBM chief slams H-P on strategy, severance

International Business Machines Corp. chief Samuel J. Palmisano stepped into the debate around 
Hewlett-Packard Co., sharply criticizing his rival for its expensive acquisition of 3PAR Inc. and for giving a large 
severance package to former Chief Executive Mark Hurd. 
In a wide-ranging interview Tuesday, the IBM CEO said he doesn't worry about companies like H-P that have 
slashed their investments in core technology. "H-P used to be a very inventive company," Mr. Palmisano said. 
IBM would never have paid as heavily as H-P did to acquire a company such as computer-storage provider 3PAR, 
he said. "[H-P] had no choice," said Mr. Palmisano. "Hurd cut out all the research and development." 
H-P earlier this month acquired 3PAR for $2.4 billion, beating out Dell Inc. in a bidding war by paying more than 
three times 3PAR's stock price before Dell's initial bid. 
H-P declined to comment on any of Mr. Palmisano's criticism. H-P's spending on research and development fell 
to $2.8 billion in the year ended October 2009 from $3.6 billion two years earlier. 
Mr. Palmisano also criticized H-P's board for the way it handled Mr. Hurd's departure in August. Although H-P 
gave Mr. Hurd a $35 million severance package, the former CEO took a top job at its rival Oracle Corp. about a 
month later. 
"That is not a good use of shareholder money," said Mr. Palmisano. "It was not handled in the best interest of 
shareholders." 
The company that Mr. Palmisano said he does worry about is software giant Oracle, which he believes will 
become the biggest threat to IBM over the long term. Oracle outbid IBM last year to acquire server maker Sun 
Microsystems. 
"Oracle has cash flow and good margins," said Mr. Palmisano. "Oracle invests." Mr. Palmisano also praised 
Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. "He has done a very good job." 
Mr. Palmisano also said Tuesday he has no plans to retire next year. "I am not going anywhere," said the 
executive, who has run the company since 2002 and turns 60 next year, the age at which some of his 
predecessors have retired. 
During the interview, Mr. Palmisano discussed a range of issues including IBM's frustrations with the Obama 
administration and the increasing importance of overseas markets. Mr. Palmisano said the U.S. government 
should pass more trade agreements and not increase taxes on income derived from exports. 
Mr. Palmisano reserved some harsh words for former IBM executive Robert W. Moffat, Jr., who was recently 
sentenced to six months in prison in connection with an insider trading scandal. "It's tragic," said Mr. Palmisano. 
"He didn't live up to our standards. You just don't behave that way at IBM. The tragedy to me is his family. It's cost 
him a lot personally."

ARMONK, N.Y. (AP) - IBM Corp. said Wednesday it has acquired OpenPages, a privately held software company 
that develops risk and compliance management systems. 
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
IBM said the deal expands its business analytics capabilities. OpenPages, which is based in Waltham, Mass., 
makes software that helps companies develop strategies for operational risk, financial controls management, 
compliance and internal audits,among other domains. Companies that use its software include Carnival Corp., 
Duke Energy and Allianz. 
IBM's announcement follows some recent acquisitions by rival Hewlett-Packard Co. It came two days after HP 
said it would buy security software maker ArcSight Inc. for $1.5 billion in cash. That deal came just a few weeks 
after HP won a bidding contest with rival Dell Inc. for the data storage company 3Par, paying $2.07 billion. 
The 3Par deal drew criticism from IBM CEO Samuel J. Palmisano at a Wall Street Journal event Tuesday. The 
Journal reported that Palmisano said IBM would never have paid that much for the company, but HP had to 
because former CEO Mark Hurd cut that company's research and development. 
IBM shares climbed 61 cents to $129.46 in Wednesday afternoon trading.

HEWLETT-PACKARD Co wants to have the answer to all of its customers' technology problems, so it is buying 
network-security provider ArcSight Inc to help it respond to the growing threat posed by hackers, computer 
viruses and digital fraud. 
The $US1.5 billion ($1.61 billion) deal announced this week extends HP's recent spate of acquisitions and could 
help signal that, even after ousting chief executive Mark Hurd, it hasn't lost its footing in the effort to win fatter 
profit margins beyond the personal-computer business. 
HP continued to brush off concerns it is paying too much to grow. The deal came weeks after HP won a bidding 
contest with Dell Inc over data-storage company 3Par Inc, agreeing to pay $2.07 billion.

Hewlett-Packard Co., the world's biggest personal-computer maker, has agreed to buy ArcSight Inc. for about 
$1.5 billion (U.S.) in cash to gain security software. 
ArcSight investors will receive $43.50 a share, Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP said Monday in a statement. That's 24 
per cent more than the stock's Sept. 10 closing price. 
The deal follows purchases by HP in areas such as services, networking equipment and smartphones, lessening 
its dependence on lower-margin computers and servers. 
ArcSight, a maker of software used to identify suspicious activity on a corporate network, may help HP better 
incorporate security features into other products. 
"HP wants to expand from their traditional hardware offerings - printers and computers and servers - and they've 
gone into more services and software," said Dave Novosel, an analyst at corporate-bond research firm Gimme 
Credit in Chicago. "This is something that's a little bit different for HP. This is not where they've had a strength in 
the past." 
HP's interim chief executive officer Cathie Lesjak agreed on Sept. 2 to pay $2.35 billion for storage-system maker 
3Par Inc., winning a bidding war with Dell Inc. by offering more than three times 3Par's closing stock price on 
Aug. 13, before Dell's interest was made public. 
The ArcSight acquisition will help HP serve the data-centre market, a linchpin of its growth strategy, said Aaron 
Rakers, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in St. Louis. Security software could assist customers in managing the 
centres, which consist of large rooms of servers that handle corporate tasks, he said. The company is trying to 
turn its leadership in PCs into a bigger role in corporate computing. 
Intel Corp. agreed last month to pay $7.68 billion for McAfee Inc., a provider of programs that protect computers 
from viruses and malware. 
The chipmaker paid a 60 per cent premium, underscoring the growing importance of computer security and 
fuelling speculation related deals may be in the works. 
Based in Cupertino, Calif., ArcSight also specializes in programs that help firms and government agencies meet 
compliance requirements for their computer systems. It has more than 1,000 customers, such as the U.S. Federal 
Reserve and Verizon Communications Inc., according to its website. 
Net income at ArcSight almost tripled to $28.4 million in the fiscal year that ended in April. Sales increased 33 per 
cent to $181.4 million in the period. 
Former HP CEO Mark Hurd left Aug. 6 after the company said he violated standards of business conduct. An 
investigation found inaccurate expense reports filed in his name that had the effect of concealing a personal 
relationship with an HP contractor. He has since been hired as a president of Oracle Corp.

(Adds comments from the CEO interview beginning in the 10th paragraph.) 
By Spencer E. Ante 
Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Chief Executive Samuel J. Palmisano 
waded into the debate around Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), sharply criticizing his rival for its expensive acquisition 
of 3PAR Inc. (PAR) and mishandling the ouster of CEO Mark Hurd. 
In a wide-ranging interview Tuesday, Palmisano said he doesn't worry about companies like H-P that have 
slashed their investments in core technology. "HP used to be a very inventive company," Palmisano said. 
IBM would never have paid so heavily to acquire a company such as computer storage provider 3PAR, he said. 
H-P "had no choice," said Palmisano. "Hurd cut out all the research and development." 
H-P acquired 3PAR for $2.4 billion, beating out Dell Inc. (DELL) in a massive bidding war by paying more than 
three times the company's closing stock price before Dell's initial bid. 
H-P declined to comment on any of Palmisano's criticism. In a release announcing the deal, H-P called it "a 
winning combination." H-P's spending on R&D fell to $2.8 billion in the year ended October 2009 from $3.6 billion 
two years earlier. 
(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) 
Palmisano also criticized H-P's board for the way it handled Hurd's departure. Although H-P gave Hurd a $35 
million severance package, the former CEO took a top job working for its rival Oracle Corp. (ORCL) about a 
month later. "That is not a good use of shareholder money," said Palmisano. ""It was not handled in the best 
interest of shareholders." 
The company Palmisano said he does worry about is software giant Oracle Corp. (ORCL), which he believes will 
become the biggest threat to IBM over the long term. "Oracle has cash flow and good margins," said Palmisano. 
"Oracle invests." Palmisano also praised Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison, saying Ellison "has done a very 
good job." 
The IBM executive also said Tuesday he has no plans to retire next year. "I am not going anywhere," he told The 
Wall Street Journal. Palmisano turns 60 next year, the age at which some of his predecessors have retired. 
During the hour-long interview, Palmisano discussed a range of issues including IBM's frustrations with the 
Obama Administration and the increasing importance of overseas markets. 
Palmisano said the U.S government should pass more trade agreements and not increase taxes on income 
derived from exports. "You can't double exports if you raise taxes on export income," Palmisano said. Some 20% 
of IBM's revenue comes from selling goods and services to governments. 
Back on the subject of competitors, Palmisano complimented Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO Steve Jobs for making 
consumer electronics simpler, saying Jobs "has done a great job getting rid of complexity."

Palmisano said Google Inc. (GOOG) had done a great job of creating a lucrative business on Internet search 
technology, which he described as more of a commodity. "The innovation is much more on the business model 
than on pure engineering," said the IBM CEO, adding that Google licenses some of IBM's patents on search 
technology. "We refer to search as dial-tone." 
Palmisano had some harsh words for former IBM executive Robert W. Moffat, Jr., who was recently sentenced to 
six months in prison in connection with an insider trading scandal. "It's tragic," said Palmisano. "He didn't live up 
to our standards. You just don't behave that way at IBM. The tragedy to me is his family. It's cost him a lot 
personally." 
Palmisano said he hasn't spoken to Moffat since he left the company in the wake of the scandal.

Hewlett-Packard Co. struck a deal Monday to acquire security-software maker ArcSight Inc. for around $1.5 
billion, continuing a spending spree that began after Chief Executive Mark Hurd resigned last month. 
H-P will pay $43.50 a share, a 24% premium to Friday's closing price of $35.10. H-P expects the acquisition to 
close by year end. 
ArcSight, Cupertino, Calif., had been shopping itself to a handful of big technology companies. Shares of ArcSight 
were trading at around $28 on Aug. 26, when The Wall Street Journal first reported the company was for sale. 
ArcSight makes software that monitors corporate networks for unusual activity, such as a hacker's attempt to 
break into a system. Its products are used by more than 1,000 customers to help prevent cyber attacks and to 
spot potential policy violations. 
The acquisition marks the second time H-P has agreed to pay a big premium for a smaller company since Mr. 
Hurd resigned on Aug. 6. The company engaged in a bidding war with rival Dell Inc. over storage-technology 
company 3PAR Inc., eventually winning it with a bid of $2.35 billion, or $33 a share, almost double the $18 a 
share that Dell had initially agreed to pay. 
Last month, H-P also announced acquisitions of closely held software makers Fortify Software Inc. and Stratavia 
Inc. Terms for those purchases weren't disclosed. 
The ArcSight deal continues the H-P push into software and other areas outside of its core computer-hardware 
businesses that began under Mr. Hurd. Software, networking, storage and services -- all areas in which H-P has 
expanded recently -- have higher margins than the company's core personal-computer and server-system 
businesses. H-P executives have said repeatedly that the company will continue the expansion strategy. 
"The combination of H-P and ArcSight will provide clients with the ability to fortify their applications, proactively 
monitor events and respond to threats," said Bill Veghte, H-P's executive vice president of software and solutions. 
ArcSight, which went public in 2008, reported revenue of $181.4 million in the fiscal year ended April 30, up 33% 
from a year earlier. Profit for the fiscal year increased to $28.4 million from $9.9 million a year before. 
The deal for ArcSight is the latest episode in a month-long drama starring H-P. Last month, Mr. Hurd resigned 
following violations of the Palo Alto, Calif., company's code of business conduct, including failure to disclose a 
personal relationship with a contractor and filing inaccurate expense reports. 
Then H-P launched its public bidding war with Dell for 3PAR. Amid criticism from analysts that it was 
overspending on 3PAR, H-P's board said it had authorized the company to buy back $10 billion of its stock. 
Before things had a chance to quiet down, Mr. Hurd joined H-P rival Oracle Corp. as co-president, a move that 
triggered a lawsuit from H-P arguing that the former CEO was breaking the confidentiality agreement he signed 
as part of his exit package. 
Security companies have attracted interest from larger information-technology providers lately as the industry's 
biggest companies look to offer a wider variety of products. Software that helps companies manage data securely 
is especially in demand. Last month, for instance, chip maker Intel Corp. agreed to buy security specialist McAfee 
Inc. for $7.7 billion.

H-P Buys ArcSight in Another Billion-Dollar Deal

H-P Buys ArcSight in Another Billion-Dollar Deal

Hewlett-Packard's buying spree continues. 
H-P announced a deal to purchase ArcSight, a security-software maker, for around $1.5 billion, or $43.50 a 
share, on Monday. The buying price represents a 24% premium over ArcSight's last closing price and is slightly 
higher than the company’s market capitalization, which stood at $1.2 billion when the market closed Friday. 
The deal, which is expected to be finalized by the end of the year, marks at least the second time H-P has agreed 
to purchase a company for a large premium since its former chief executive Mark Hurd resigned on Aug.6. H-P 
purchased data-storage company 3PAR on Sept. 2 after an extended bidding process with Dell at a price that 
many analysts and H-P shareholders say may have been too high. 
Ongoing acquisition talks could signal a shift in H-P's strategy following Hurd's exit, and some analysts say it is 
unclear whether the multibillion-dollar spending spree will pay off. 
The biggest concern for H-P shareholders should be that the spending has been focused on second- and 
third-tier companies that are relative unknowns and that offer neither a service nor a product revolutionary enough 
to propel H-P forward, says Trip Chowdhry, a senior analyst at Global Equities Research. He says the deal may 
be unwise "not in terms of valuation, but because at the end of the day, what value will H-P provide with ArcSight, 
a lackluster company that is not a leader in what they do?" 
He adds that H-P's buying strategy could be straining its relationships with larger partners; at least 40% of H-P's 
business is being driven by its partnership with Oracle – which provides applications for H-P computers – and 
about 30% of its business is driven by its relationship with Microsoft, which includes Microsoft Exchange Server 
and security alliances, he says. "They're converting partners into competitors in what [could be] a loser's 
strategy," he says. 
Other analysts say ArcSight is an up-and-coming player in a field poised for growth. 
"We continue to view Arcsight as fundamentally well positioned as the leading player (20% estimated market 
share) in the growing $1.3 billion (2010 estimate) Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) market," 
Gary Spivak, senior research analyst at Noble Financial, wrote in a report. The company's strongest presence is 
within the government and the financial sector, with 27% and 34% of bookings, respectively, and health care and 
utilities are expected to emerge as future revenue growth drivers, he wrote. 
Compliance issues are expected to lead sales growth. "The volume, sophistication and liability risk of security 
intrusions is increasing at an alarming rate, which will raise market awareness as well as drive market growth," 
Erik Suppiger, managing director at Signal Hill, wrote in a report. "We believe the SIEM market will consolidate 
over time and ArcSight is well positioned to extend its leadership position." 
ArcSight shareholders could benefit from the deal announced Monday – although, in a manner of speaking, they 
may have already. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company went public in 2008 and has been on the buying block 
for at least eight months, says Chowdhry. Its stock, which closed at $35.10 on Friday, is up 86% from June in part 
on buyout talks and its recent earnings. On Sept. 2, the company reported total revenues of $48.1 million for first 
quarter of fiscal year 2011, compared with $34.6 million the previous year. Net income was eight cents per diluted 
share, up from three cents a year ago.

Directors. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bill. 
BILL VEGHTE, EVP SOFTWARE & SOLUTIONS, HEWLETT-PACKARD DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, L.P.: 
Great, thanks, Steve. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. While I haven't had the privilege of 
meeting many of you yet, I'll look forward to doing this in coming months. 
What I thought I would do is I would spend about 10 minutes talking about HP's (technical difficulty) and what this 
deal means to the strategy, and then I'll look forward to taking some of your questions. 
At the most basic level this announcement signals HP's intent to be a leader in providing solutions for enterprises 
that improve their security, reduce their risk, and help them stay compliant at lower cost. Before I dive in though, 
against that let me take a quick step back and set some context.

Page 83 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
By way of introduction, as Steve mentioned, I joined HP about five months ago. I joined HP because HP's 
software business is a good business with a profitable business model, a business with a set of unique assets, 
people, technology, and global reach that are winning customers. Our software is a leader in many of the 
segments we play in today. 
In the past 12 months alone we have released some remarkable innovations -- over 30 new products as well as 
over 40 updates to our existing products including, most recently, the game changing introduction of Business 
Service Manager 9.0 which provides a near-real-time view of IT configuration states. But frankly we have the 
opportunity to do an enormous amount more. 
Customers expect coherent solutions created by the intersection between software, services, and hardware. And 
no company in the market today is better positioned than HP. We have market-leading services organizations, 
leading converged infrastructure offerings, and market-leading capabilities in IT management, application test and 
validation, and information management. 
As we go through this incredible period of change in the IT industry, HP has the assets and the position to lead. 
Today's announcement is all about accelerating our growth and about taking advantage of this leadership 
position. 
Let me tell you a little bit more about why I feel this way. And it starts with what I see happening in the industry. 
The security market is large and growing at double-digit levels. It is an area where customers are looking for not 
only great software products but the services and hardware around it to deliver a coherent solution. HP has the 
ability to provide these integrated solutions to our customers. 
It is an area that builds on our current software assets that help enterprises develop applications faster with 
higher quality, operate their IT infrastructure more efficiently, and store their information for faster and lower cost 
retrieval. 
Again and again I have heard customers struggling to secure their enterprise, keep their compliance costs down 
in the rising tide of regulation, and manage their risk. They have asked us what we can do to help, and today we 
are taking an aggressive step forward to help with a new and better approach. 
Why are they asking this? They are asking because of escalating complexity, escalating threats, and escalating 
regulation. 
Let's talk a little bit about the complexity. As you and I know, everything is connected, everything, and it is 
connected in a digital way. Many of these connections are through public infrastructure. 
Employees, partners, customers --all expect access. They expect deep connectivity to each other; and with that 
connectivity and with that access is escalating risk. 
Escalating risk as critical applications and information are targeted with sophisticated and evolving attacks over 
sustained periods of time. Days of smash-and-grab attacks are gone. Today's security threats are more 
sophisticated, more complex, and more sustained. 
We have all read about the large number of security breaches that have occurred, and they have occurred to 
some of the most sophisticated IT organizations in the world. 
This in turn -- this complexity, this risk, is in turn driving escalating regulation and compliance requirements. 
Regulation and compliance requirements that are driving up costs for businesses. 
Just take in the cyber security space alone, there are over 80 current and pending legislative bills globally and 25 
pending in Congress. And there a broad array of non-cyber-security regulations and compliance pending as well, 
whether you are in financial services or in healthcare. 
As a result, because of this complex, escalating risk and escalating regulation, HP does not believe that the 
current practice of layering multiple prevention products after the fact will work. We believe organizations need a 
new approach, an approach where security and IT operations are converged, not siloed. An approach where 
security is designed upfront the application and service the enterprise is developing. An approach that is holistic 
and proactive. 
To do this, there are 4 key elements. First, you have to fortify it. This means finding out vulnerabilities at 
application design and development time.

Page 84 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Second, you have to have visibility. You have to see the threat. By this I mean the solution must proactively 
monitor real-time events and activity across the enterprise. 
If you can't see it, you can't secure it. Today's threats are impossible to detect without gaining a comprehensive 
view of all enterprise IT activity. Who is connecting, what they are seeing and doing, and how this impacts risk. 
To understand this you have to see everything from activity to configuration state to roles, rights and past history. 
Third, you have to understand it. This means assessing the risk and impact to business operations. Then once I 
have visibility and I have understood it, then I need to run it. I need to take action. And preferably that action is 
done automatically with technology and escalated to a human only when the conditions are so risky and so 
ambiguous that an automated response cannot be executed. 
We believe that HP and ArcSight deliver on these 4 elements of fortifying the application at development time; 
providing the broadest, best visibility; providing the best context to understand it; and then finally providing the 
remediation actions. 
Let me be more specific. ArcSight combined with HP's market- leading IT management software will give 
enterprises the ability to have the broadest view of all IT events happening in their enterprise of any single 
solution in the market today. ArcSight combined with HP's market-leading IT management software provides 
market-leading correlation capabilities to assess the risk and impact to business operations. So seeing it; 
understanding it; and then finally HP's IT management software tools provide the capability to automate many of 
the responses so action can happen quickly and automatically. 
Now, you couple this with HP's broad capabilities in sales, services, and hardware -- and we have a remarkable 
opportunity to help customers. More specifically, HP's global sales and marketing presence provides an extensive 
channel to deliver these solutions together. 
Second, ArcSight joins a strong portfolio of security capabilities that already exist. The leading application 
validation in the IT management tools that I already referenced. HP's Secure Advantage portfolio, an integrated 
set of more than 80 services and products across storage, servers, and services. TippingPoint, the leader in 
network intrusion prevention systems, which ArcSight is already working with to help customers take action 
against the security threats on their network. 
And finally, market-leading enterprise services that provide security managed services and outsourcing offerings 
across the lifecycle of data centers, applications, and industry solutions. 
Clients need and want a new approach that provides a proactive, holistic capability to protect their enterprise, 
lower their risk, and lower their compliance costs. Today with this move we provide that opportunity. 
I would like to thank you very much for your time. I particularly appreciate the folks on the West Coast getting up 
early for this. And Steve and I would love to take your questions. 
OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley. 
KATY HUBERTY, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Good morning. Thanks. Bill, CIOs that we speak with 
suggest that there is really no company in the market today that offers a full end-to-end security solution. So I 
guess the question is is it your view that HP has the opportunity to acquire the assets to provide that end-to-end 
solution? Are you willing to spend the money to get there? 
BILL VEGHTE: Thanks, Katy, for your question and good morning. The approach that we'll take is an approach 
that breaks down the traditional silos between IT operations and security to provide broader visibility, better 
context, and better continuity. So that is where we will focus. 
Broader visibility -- so this is giving you the view of all events across the IT operations, security, and compliance. 
Deeper context -- so you have got market-leading context, contextual capabilities, between ArcSight and HP to 
detect the threats and pattern-match to the correlating responses. 
And then better continuity is about this constant feedback loop between IT operations and security; and then 
frankly looping it all the way back, Kathy, to the design and development of applications and services. Because 
we believe it is not only about what you do once the application and service is deployed and operated, but making 
sure that security is baked in at design time.

Page 85 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
You look at our leading application validation tools, where we had dynamic testing capabilities for security; the 
recent announcement around Fortify gives us market-leading capabilities on precompile, so before the application 
is actually compiled, so that gives us the ability to help enterprises bake security in upfront. 
KATY HUBERTY: Then just a quick follow-up, Steve. Can you remind us who is in charge of integrating all the 
backend systems with the run rate of acquisitions we have seen out of HP? 
STEVEN FIELER: Yes, so we have -- we have got a pretty standard integration process that has been developed 
really since Compaq and revved since then through EDS and all the other acquisitions we have done. So we 
have got both corporate-led integration, dedicated folks that do this day in, day out. It is in their blood. 
As well as folks within the business, and clearly on the Software side there has been a good history of 
acquisitions and integration experience within the business unit itself. 
KATY HUBERTY: Thanks. 
STEVEN FIELER: Next question, please. 
OPERATOR: Ben Reitzes, Barclays Capital. 
BEN REITZES, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you, was it a competitive 
bidding process? Also, when did you guys start talking? And then I have a follow-up. 
STEVEN FIELER: Yes, Ben, we are not going to get into the details of the process in this call. Clearly ArcSight as 
part of the 14D-9 and the tender process, we will file the background of the merger. But we are not going to get 
into specifics of the deal process today. So maybe we will go to your follow-up question. 
BEN REITZES: All right. Well, I guess I just wanted to also know a little bit more. I think you answered it a little bit 
in the prior question. But I mean the big question is do you really need a client presence? I mean, this sounds like 
a higher-end type security software. And I think everybody wants to know just point-blank -- I mean, does this, 
Fortify and TippingPoint, is it a better way to go? And do you need a client presence in terms of security to be a 
leader with the way this market is moving? 
BILL VEGHTE: Ben, thanks for your question and I will take that. It goes back to the core point I was making to 
Kathy just a moment ago. Our approach will be providing the best visibility. If you have a view on all of those 
different IT events across IT operations, security, and compliance -- if I have got that comprehensive set of 
events, the second piece is then our ability to understand it, so context. 
There are good, very good correlation engines within the ArcSight product offering and then within HP's IT 
operations software capability. And then it is about automation. 
So I see it. I understand the impact of it. And then I take action on it. 
Our approach will be around those three elements combined with making sure that as applications are built that 
they are built with security in mind. So that is how we will focus our strategy, our approach, and our value 
proposition to enterprise customers. 
BEN REITZES: Okay. Thanks. 
OPERATOR: Toni Sacconaghi, Sanford Bernstein. 
TONI SACCONAGHI, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN: Yes, thank you. Bill, HP has now announced its 
two most expensive deals in its history, paying about 8 times revenue for ArcSight and 12 times revenue for 
3PAR, both immediately on the heels of the departure of Mark Hurd. I realize you have only been at HP five 
months, but perhaps you can provide your perspective. 
Are these expensive deals a coincidence? Or is the hurdle rate for acquisitions changed now that Mark is gone? 
And how do you address the criticism that HP appears to be arguably overpaying for growth? 
BILL VEGHTE: At a macro level, Tony, from my perspective -- as I have joined HP and watched them operate 
they have a very clear and good M&A strategy and approach; and that is unchanged. The Company continues to 
make acquisitions where they make strategic operational and financial sense. And we will always look at whether 
we build or we buy or we partner as we continue to add value to customers.

Page 86 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Certainly in my experience, Tony, since being here -- as you can get a sense from this call -- we have a strategy 
and an approach. The strategy and approach is around providing that solution for enterprises that improves their 
security, reduces their risk, and helps them stay compliant at lower cost. And we will do that by providing visibility, 
context, and continuity. 
And then I am looking at it and saying -- okay, we have got a set of assets that we are delivering organically, and 
then where inorganic or where partnering makes sense we will do just that. 
TONI SACCONAGHI: So Bill, just to follow up, some of the press articles have stated that many companies were 
involved, so this obviously didn't happen in the last week. Are you confident that this offer would have been made 
one month ago by Hewlett-Packard? 
STEVEN FIELER: Tony, we're not going to speculate on what would or would not have happened with the prior 
CEO. We are very confident in where we are today and are real excited about moving forward with this deal. 
TONI SACCONAGHI: Thank you. 
OPERATOR: Shannon Cross, Cross Research. 
SHANNON CROSS, ANALYST, CROSS RESEARCH: Thank you very much. I just wanted to follow up on some 
of the prior questions on how HP is now positioned within the security market. I am just curious; is there any part 
of it that you don't see as strategic or that isn't potentially of interest to you? 
BILL VEGHTE: Shannon, this was a really nice match. It is a really nice match because if you look at the products 
that ArcSight has, they've got a great logging engine that people are writing events to. They have the 
market-leading correlation event engine. So this is -- you take all these events and how do you correlate it to give 
a good view of the security and compliance risk clients' risk in an enterprise space. 
That is on the security side. And then you look at what we have got on the software side in IT operating and you 
can combine them. 
The other thing is when you look at it you say -- okay, where do we see opportunities? There is a huge 
opportunity where ArcSight has market position in 29% of the Fortune 100 and 12% of the Fortune 1000. Wow. 
You apply our world-class enterprise sales force and service around that, and you have the ability to not only 
provide a better solution, but a better route to market. 
SHANNON CROSS: Okay, great. Then Steve, I have a follow-up for you. I understand you don't want to get into 
deal specifics. But given what went on with 3PAR, is there any comfort you can give is that this isn't going to turn 
into another bidding war? Given that there were -- again, according to news reports -- several people that were 
interested in it. I mean are you pretty confident this is done? 
STEVEN FIELER: We are very confident in where we are, and yes we certainly aren't going to speculate on 
anything beyond that. 
SHANNON CROSS: Okay, thank you. 
OPERATOR: Keith Bachman, Bank of Montreal. 
KEITH BACHMAN, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS: Yes, I have two questions also if I could. Number one, 
can you give us a little sense about the leverage opportunity here that you think HP sales would bring to 
ArcSight? Particularly I am still not clear on how it leverages into the whole management OpenView suite. And 
then I have a follow-up, please. 
BILL VEGHTE: Great, thanks Keith. So at a macro level you have a bunch of customers that are deeply engaged 
with HP, deeply engaged in how we provide IT services. And one of the leading conversations and growth areas 
is around security and compliance, as you may know or as I have referenced earlier on this call. 
So we have whether it be TippingPoint or our Enterprise Services offerings, we have a variety of security 
offerings. This is meant to complement it and frankly accelerate it to provide a better solution in the marketplace. 
To your second point or your second question, which is really about, how do you think of your software assets, 
whether it be the IT management, software capabilities, or the application development capabilities?

Page 87 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
It goes back, Keith, to the point I was making earlier. If you look over the last 15 years, you go way back. Security 
was a management problem way back there. Then for a variety of reasons security and management became 
separate silos, and separate silos where you are products around IT operations and IT management and 
separate products for security. 
It is our belief that the complexity, the regulatory costs, and the risks are going to drive technology vendors such 
as ourselves and frankly customers to look for simpler, more proactive, holistic solutions. 
So let's just take the first pillar that I mentioned around visibility. ArcSight has the best, most comprehensive view 
of security events. We have in our IT management portfolio the best, most comprehensive view of IT assets. So 
in a thing we call the CMDB, which is basically a descriptor of your IT assets; so for example applications, 
services, hardware, changes in state. 
You put those two views together, you have broader visibility of what is going on in the enterprise. And with that 
visibility you can do a better job of correlating it to -- whether that correlation is interruption of a critical business 
service or you are correlating it to a compliance risk or security threat. 
KEITH BACHMAN: Okay. Steve, let me ask my follow-up to you then if I could. It seems like HP is writing a lot of 
checks here. Your net debt now is over $5 billion. You have announced you are increasing the buyback to $10 
billion. You have transacted for 3PAR and now ArcSight. 
Where is Hewlett-Packard willing to take the net debt to? Is there a level that is comfortable? Or how should 
investors be thinking about your balance sheet? 
STEVEN FIELER: If you look at the Q3 results, Tony -- 
KEITH BACHMAN: Keith. 
STEVEN FIELER: Excuse me, Keith; sorry about that. You know we had $14.8 billion of gross cash. We had $4 
billion of net cash excluding HPFS. So we are clearly in a position of a strong balance sheet cash position. 
We generated $3.3 billion in Q3 of operating -- or cash flow from operations. So we have got a strong balance 
sheet; good cash generation ability. 
And certainly the events you just described in Q4, we certainly are in a strong position to do what we are doing 
from what we have announced previously on a share buyback perspective and the acquisitions we have 
announced this quarter. So we feel very comfortable with our balance sheet and cash flow generation. 
KEITH BACHMAN: Okay, thank you. 
OPERATOR: Rich Gardner, Citi. 
RICH GARDNER, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Hi, apologies if the question has already been answered; but I don't 
believe there has been any talk of accretion-dilution on the call. 
STEVEN FIELER: This is Steve, Rich; thanks for the question. We did not mention that. But we will obviously be 
giving segment-level guidance I guess in just about two weeks at the security analysts meeting. But again with 
this deal size we don't expect any material EPS dilution in FY11 from a GAAP or non-GAAP perspective. 
RICH GARDNER: Okay. Thanks, Steve. 
STEVEN FIELER: Okay. We have got time for one more question here. 
OPERATOR: Abhey Lamba, ISI Group. 
ABHEY LAMBA, ANALYST, ISI GROUP: Yes, thanks. Steve, the multiples -- I just want to revisit that cushion. 
They seem a little lofty from historical transaction point of view. You guys mentioned that you guys have not 
changed the process how you evaluate transactions within HP. 
So can you help us understand how you think about the pricing that you're willing to pay, and estimate the ROI or 
payback period for the deal?

Page 88 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
STEVEN FIELER: Yes. I mean I think the first thing you do is look at ArcSight, right? The business has been 
growing roughly in the 40% range over the past several years; and in their most recent quarter, the same. So the 
business is demonstrating good growth. 
It has also got good operating margins, high double-digit operating margins. So it is a strong business that is 
growing and that is generating profit. 
As part of HP -- and just to piggyback on what Bill was describing earlier -- with our sales reach and distribution 
capabilities, this is really all about accelerating the growth and profitability of ArcSight with HP's assets. 
So we feel like as we have done in all deals, we build the business case, the financial models; and it is all about 
the discounted cash flows. And we are very confident in the business plan that we have created on this. 
ABHEY LAMBA: Got you. Bill, can you highlight some big areas of focus for HP's Software group now that you 
have been there for a few months? We have seen some activity on the security front, but what are the other areas 
that are of importance for your organization? 
BILL VEGHTE: Great, thanks a lot for your question. At a macro level as you think about HP's Software business 
I would highlight four areas. The first is how we help enterprises accelerate the delivery of their applications and 
services. So it is about building, helping enterprises build the right highest-quality applications and services. 
The second is about operating IT infrastructure. So operating IT infrastructure in a near-real-time way an in a 
simpler, more cost-effective way. 
Obviously we believe that there is strong relationship between building the application and then how you provision 
and operate it in IT infrastructure. Today with this announcement we are talking about build, operate and secure. 
And we believe as I was talking about relative to Keith's question that the relationship between IT management 
and security, those silos come down because customers need a more frankly proactive holistic solution than what 
they have been able to experience to date. 
Then the final piece, the final pillar as we think about it is our ability to store and manage information in a lower 
cost, faster retrieval fashion to provide the right enterprise information management capability. 
STEVEN FIELER: Thanks, everyone, for the questions. I will turn it back to Bill for any closing comments that you 
want to provide. 
BILL VEGHTE: Great. Well thanks, everyone, for the time and the questions. I will look forward to our subsequent 
conversations. 
I will just go back to the macro level, which is that we see a market that needs a proactive, holistic, new approach 
to security and compliance. And this announcement signals HP's intent to deliver, to be a leader in delivering that 
capability in how enterprises improve their security, reduce their risk, and help them stay compliant at lower cost. 
STEVEN FIELER: Thank you. Operator, I think we are done with the call here. Thanks everyone for participating. 
OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You

QUESTION AND ANSWER SUMMARY 
OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley. 
KATY HUBERTY, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Good morning. Thanks. Bill, CIOs that we speak with 
suggest that there is really no company in the market today that offers a full end-to-end security solution. So I 
guess the question is is it your view that HP has the opportunity to acquire the assets to provide that end-to-end 
solution? Are you willing to spend the money to get there? 
BILL VEGHTE, EVP SOFTWARE & SOLUTIONS, HEWLETT-PACKARD DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, L.P.: 
Thanks, Katy, for your question and good morning. The approach that we'll take is an approach that breaks down 
the traditional silos between IT operations and security to provide broader visibility, better context, and better 
continuity. So that is where we will focus. 
Broader visibility -- so this is giving you the view of all events across the IT operations, security, and compliance. 
Deeper context -- so you have got market-leading context, contextual capabilities, between ArcSight and HP to 
detect the threats and pattern-match to the correlating responses. 
And then better continuity is about this constant feedback loop between IT operations and security; and then 
frankly looping it all the way back, Kathy, to the design and development of applications and services. Because 
we believe it is not only about what you do once the application and service is deployed and operated, but making 
sure that security is baked in at design time. 
You look at our leading application validation tools, where we had dynamic testing capabilities for security; the 
recent announcement around Fortify gives us market-leading capabilities on precompile, so before the application 
is actually compiled, so that gives us the ability to help enterprises bake security in upfront. 
KATY HUBERTY: Then just a quick follow-up, Steve. Can you remind us who is in charge of integrating all the 
backend systems with the run rate of acquisitions we have seen out of HP? 
STEVEN FIELER, VP IR, HEWLETT-PACKARD DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, L.P.: Yes, so we have -- we have 
got a pretty standard integration process that has been developed really since Compaq and revved since then 
through EDS and all the other acquisitions we have done. So we have got both corporate-led integration, 
dedicated folks that do this day in, day out. It is in their blood. 
As well as folks within the business, and clearly on the Software side there has been a good history of 
acquisitions and integration experience within the business unit itself. 
KATY HUBERTY: Thanks.

STEVEN FIELER: Next question, please. 
OPERATOR: Ben Reitzes, Barclays Capital. 
BEN REITZES, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you, was it a competitive 
bidding process? Also, when did you guys start talking? And then I have a follow-up. 
STEVEN FIELER: Yes, Ben, we are not going to get into the details of the process in this call. Clearly ArcSight as 
part of the 14D-9 and the tender process, we will file the background of the merger. But we are not going to get 
into specifics of the deal process today. So maybe we will go to your follow-up question.

offerings. This is meant to complement it and frankly accelerate it to provide a better solution in the marketplace. 
To your second point or your second question, which is really about, how do you think of your software assets, 
whether it be the IT management, software capabilities, or the application development capabilities? 
It goes back, Keith, to the point I was making earlier. If you look over the last 15 years, you go way back. Security 
was a management problem way back there. Then for a variety of reasons security and management became 
separate silos, and separate silos where you are products around IT operations and IT management and 
separate products for security. 
It is our belief that the complexity, the regulatory costs, and the risks are going to drive technology vendors such 
as ourselves and frankly customers to look for simpler, more proactive, holistic solutions. 
So let's just take the first pillar that I mentioned around visibility. ArcSight has the best, most comprehensive view 
of security events. We have in our IT management portfolio the best, most comprehensive view of IT assets. So 
in a thing we call the CMDB, which is basically a descriptor of your IT assets; so for example applications, 
services, hardware, changes in state. 
You put those two views together, you have broader visibility of what is going on in the enterprise. And with that 
visibility you can do a better job of correlating it to -- whether that correlation is interruption of a critical business 
service or you are correlating it to a compliance risk or security threat.

KEITH BACHMAN: Okay. Steve, let me ask my follow-up to you then if I could. It seems like HP is writing a lot of 
checks here. Your net debt now is over $5 billion. You have announced you are increasing the buyback to $10 
billion. You have transacted for 3PAR and now ArcSight. 
Where is Hewlett-Packard willing to take the net debt to? Is there a level that is comfortable? Or how should 
investors be thinking about your balance sheet? 
STEVEN FIELER: If you look at the Q3 results, Tony -- 
KEITH BACHMAN: Keith. 
STEVEN FIELER: Excuse me, Keith; sorry about that. You know we had $14.8 billion of gross cash. We had $4 
billion of net cash excluding HPFS. So we are clearly in a position of a strong balance sheet cash position. 
We generated $3.3 billion in Q3 of operating -- or cash flow from operations. So we have got a strong balance 
sheet; good cash generation ability. 
And certainly the events you just described in Q4, we certainly are in a strong position to do what we are doing 
from what we have announced previously on a share buyback perspective and the acquisitions we have 
announced this quarter. So we feel very comfortable with our balance sheet and cash flow generation. 
KEITH BACHMAN: Okay, thank you. 
OPERATOR: Rich Gardner, Citi. 
RICH GARDNER, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Hi, apologies if the question has already been answered; but I don't 
believe there has been any talk of accretion-dilution on the call. 
STEVEN FIELER: This is Steve, Rich; thanks for the question. We did not mention that. But we will obviously be 
giving segment-level guidance I guess in just about two weeks at the security analysts meeting. But again with 
this deal size we don't expect any material EPS dilution in FY11 from a GAAP or non-GAAP perspective. 
RICH GARDNER: Okay. Thanks, Steve. 
STEVEN FIELER: Okay. We have got time for one more question here. 
OPERATOR: Abhey Lamba, ISI Group. 
ABHEY LAMBA, ANALYST, ISI GROUP: Yes, thanks. Steve, the multiples -- I just want to revisit that cushion. 
They seem a little lofty from historical transaction point of view. You guys mentioned that you guys have not 
changed the process how you evaluate transactions within HP. 
So can you help us understand how you think about the pricing that you're willing to pay, and estimate the ROI or 
payback period for the deal? 
STEVEN FIELER: Yes. I mean I think the first thing you do is look at ArcSight, right? The business has been 
growing roughly in the 40% range over the past several years; and in their most recent quarter, the same. So the 
business is demonstrating good growth. 
It has also got good operating margins, high double-digit operating margins. So it is a strong business that is 
growing and that is generating profit. 
As part of HP -- and just to piggyback on what Bill was describing earlier -- with our sales reach and distribution 
capabilities, this is really all about accelerating the growth and profitability of ArcSight with HP's assets. 
So we feel like as we have done in all deals, we build the business case, the financial models; and it is all about 
the discounted cash flows. And we are very confident in the business plan that we have created on this. 
ABHEY LAMBA: Got you. Bill, can you highlight some big areas of focus for HP's Software group now that you 
have been there for a few months? We have seen some activity on the security front, but what are the other areas 
that are of importance for your organization? 
BILL VEGHTE: Great, thanks a lot for your question. At a macro level as you think about HP's Software business 
I would highlight four areas. The first is how we help enterprises accelerate the delivery of their applications and 
services. So it is about building, helping enterprises build the right highest-quality applications and services.

Page 95 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The second is about operating IT infrastructure. So operating IT infrastructure in a near-real-time way an in a 
simpler, more cost-effective way. 
Obviously we believe that there is strong relationship between building the application and then how you provision 
and operate it in IT infrastructure. Today with this announcement we are talking about build, operate and secure. 
And we believe as I was talking about relative to Keith's question that the relationship between IT management 
and security, those silos come down because customers need a more frankly proactive holistic solution than what 
they have been able to experience to date. 
Then the final piece, the final pillar as we think about it is our ability to store and manage information in a lower 
cost, faster retrieval fashion to provide the right enterprise information management capability. 
STEVEN FIELER: Thanks, everyone, for the questions. I will turn it back to Bill for any closing comments that you 
want to provide. 
BILL VEGHTE: Great. Well thanks, everyone, for the time and the questions. I will look forward to our subsequent 
conversations. 
I will just go back to the macro level, which is that we see a market that needs a proactive, holistic, new approach 
to security and compliance. And this announcement signals HP's intent to deliver, to be a leader in delivering that 
capability in how enterprises improve their security, reduce their risk, and help them stay compliant at lower cost. 
STEVEN FIELER: Thank you. Operator, I think we are done with the call here. Thanks everyone for participating. 
OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You 
may now disconnect. Have a great day.

On buyout spree, HP to acquire ArcSight in $1.5 bn deal 
On buyout spree, HP to acquire ArcSight in $1.5 bn deal

The Press Trust of India Limited

New York, September 13, 2010 (PTI) -- Continuing its acquisition spree, 
technology major Hewlett-Packard today said it will snap up security software maker ArcSight in a USD 1.5 billion 
deal. 
The announcement comes barely two weeks after HP emerged as the successful suitor for global storage 
solutions provider 3PAR, outbidding rival Dell with a USD 2.35 billion offer. 
HP would acquire ArcSight for USD 43.50 per share in a deal with an enterprise value of USD 1.5 billion. Both 
companies have entered into a definitive agreement for the proposed transaction. 
The technology major said the combination with ArcSight would improve security, reduce risk and facilitate 
compliance at a lower cost for customers. 
"The acquisition will be conducted by means of a cash tender offer for all of ArcSight's outstanding shares of 
common stock," HP said in a statement. 
Subject to various approvals, the proposed deal is expected to be complete by the end of this year. 
The two billion-dollar deals -- acquiring 3PAR and ArcSight -- have been announced little over a month after HP 
saw the exit of its high-profile CEO Mark Hurd in the wake of sexual harassment allegations. Hurd, who had 
engineered a turnaround at the company, stepped down in early August. 
"The combination of HP and ArcSight will provide clients with the ability to fortify their applications, proactively 
monitor events and respond to threats," HP's Executive Vice President (Software and Solutions) Bill Veghte said. 
ArcSight is a leading global provider of cyber security and compliance solutions that helps in protecting 
companies from enterprise threats and risks. 
Meanwhile, in the battle for 3PAR, a belligerent HP had raised the stakes against Dell before trumping with a 
USD 33 per share offer. Both companies kept on raising the buyout offer and finally 3PAR accepted HP's bid in 
early September. PTI RAM SHT 09132132

Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) has struck a deal to buy security-software maker ArcSight Inc. (ARST) for about $1.5 
billion, confirming a Sunday report by The Wall Street Journal and marking the latest deal by the 
computer-making giant. 
It will pay $43.50 a share, a 24% premium to Friday's closing price. H-P expects the acquisition to close by the 
end of the calendar year. 
"The combination of H-P and ArcSight will provide clients with the ability to fortify their applications, proactively 
monitor events and respond to threats," said Bill Veghte, H-P's executive vice president of software and solutions. 
This acquisition marks the second time H-P has agreed to pay a big premium for a small technology company 
since its chief executive, Mark Hurd, resigned in August. Earlier this month, H-P said it would pay $2.35 billion for 
storage maker 3PAR Inc. (PAR) after a bidding war with Dell Inc. (DELL). 
ArcSight, of Cupertino, Calif., had been quietly shopping itself to a handful of big technology companies, the 
Journal reported last week. The company makes software that monitors corporate networks for unusual activity, 
such as a hacker's attempt to break into a system. ArcSight attracted interest from a number of large tech 
companies, and bidding quickly surpassed $40 a share, people familiar with the matter had told the Journal. 
ArcSight said early this month that its fiscal first-quarter profit nearly tripled on higher revenue. Results topped 
expectations and it forecast second-quarter results above analysts' estimates. 
Shares of H-P climbed 0.9% to $38.55 premarket, in line with a broader market rally following gains by stocks 
overseas. As of Friday's close, H-P had fallen 26% so far this year.

H-P Buys ArcSight for $1.5 Billion

Hewlett-Packard Co. struck a deal Monday to acquire security-software maker ArcSight Inc. for around $1.5 
billion, continuing a spending spree that began after Chief Executive Mark Hurd resigned last month. 
H-P will pay $43.50 a share, a 24% premium to Friday's closing price of $35.10. H-P expects the acquisition to 
close by the end of the year. 
ArcSight, Cupertino, Calif., had been shopping itself to a handful of big technology companies. Shares of ArcSight 
were trading at around $28 on Aug. 26, when The Wall Street Journal first reported the company was for sale. 
ArcSight makes software that monitors corporate networks for unusual activity, such as a hacker's attempt to 
break into a system. Its products are used by more than 1,000 customers to help prevent cyber attacks and to 
spot potential policy violations. 
The acquisition marks the second time H-P has agreed to pay a big premium for a smaller company since Mr. 
Hurd resigned on Aug. 6. The company engaged in a bidding war with rival Dell Inc. over storage-technology 
company 3PAR Inc., eventually winning it with a bid of $2.35 billion, or $33 a share, almost double the $18 a 
share that Dell had initially agreed to pay. 
Last month, H-P also announced acquisitions of closely held software makers Fortify Software Inc. and Stratavia 
Inc. Terms for those purchases weren't disclosed. 
The ArcSight deal continues the H-P push into software and other areas outside of its core computer-hardware 
businesses that began under Mr. Hurd. Software, networking, storage and services—all areas in which H-P has 
expanded recently—have higher margins than the company's core personal-computer and server-system 
businesses. H-P executives have said repeatedly that the company will continue the expansion strategy. 
"The combination of H-P and ArcSight will provide clients with the ability to fortify their applications, proactively 
monitor events and respond to threats," said Bill Veghte, H-P's executive vice president of software and solutions. 
ArcSight, which went public in 2008, reported revenue of $181.4 million in the fiscal year ended April 30, up 33% 
from a year earlier. Profit for the fiscal year increased to $28.4 million from $9.9 million a year before. 
The deal for ArcSight is the latest episode in a month-long drama starring H-P. Last month, Mr. Hurd resigned 
following violations of the Palo Alto, Calif., company's code of business conduct, including failure to disclose a 
personal relationship with a contractor and filing inaccurate expense reports. 
Then H-P launched its public bidding war with Dell for 3PAR. Amid criticism from analysts that it was 
overspending on 3PAR, H-P's board announced that it had authorized the company to buy back $10 billion of its 
stock. 
Before things had a chance to quiet down, Mr. Hurd joined H-P rival Oracle Corp. as co-president, a move that 
triggered a lawsuit from H-P arguing that the former CEO was breaking the confidentiality agreement he signed 
as part of his exit package. 
Security companies have attracted interest from larger information-technology providers lately as the industry's 
biggest companies look to offer a wider variety of products. Software that helps companies manage data securely 
is especially in demand. Last month, for instance, chip maker Intel Corp. agreed to buy security specialist McAfee 
Inc. for $7.7 billion.

Hewlett-Packard Co. is nearing a deal to acquire security-software maker ArcSight Inc. for around $1.5 billion, 
people familiar with the matter said. 
ArcSight's market capitalization was $1.2 billion, or $35.10 a share, in 4 p.m. trading on the Nasdaq stock 
exchange Friday. ArcSight had been seeking around $42 a share, people familiar with the matter said, but the 
exact price per share H-P is willing to pay couldn't be learned. 
A deal could be announced as early as Monday. 
A spokeswoman for H-P declined to comment. A spokesman for ArcSight didn't immediately respond to a request 
for comment. 
This is the second time that H-P has agreed to pay a big premium for a small technology company since its chief 
executive, Mark Hurd, resigned in August. Earlier this month, H-P said it would pay $2.35 billion for storage

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Hewlett-Packard Co. on Monday said it will buy ArcSight Inc., a security and 
compliance-management firm, in a $1.5 billion deal that underscores the company's continued efforts to expand 
in the corporate data-center market. 
It was H-P's (HPQ, US) fourth such deal in as many weeks -- prevailing with $2.35 billion in the bidding war for 
3Par Inc., along with two other, smaller acquisitions whose valuations were not disclosed. All four deals were 
announced following the abrupt departure of Mark Hurd, the former chief executive, in early August. Read "H-P 
becomes a shop-a-holic without a CEO." 
"Who is in charge?" asked Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets in a note Monday morning. H-P shares were 
down about 0.5% to $38 by midday trades. 
Bachman said that discussions for the ArcSight (ARST, US) deal likely began months ago, so he doesn't believe 
the company's current leadership change sparked the move. "However, the price does seem high," he added. 
H-P said it will pay $43.50 a share to acquire ArcSight, a Cupertino, Calif.-based company that develops 
technologies that help businesses and government agencies secure their networks against cyber-security threats. 
The deal represents a 54% premium over ArcSight's share price as of late August -- before rumors that the 
company was being shopped around to buyers began to drive up the stock. 
The deal also represents a record high for ArcSight's shares. The company earned $30.5 million in non-GAAP net 
income on revenue of $181.4 million for the fiscal year ended April 30. The offer price represents a 
price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 56 times estimated earnings for the next four quarters, and 6.7 times estimated 
revenue for the same period. 
"The deal is expensive, and likely to reinvigorate concerns about H-P's financial discipline and seemingly zealous 
desire to quickly add growth assets following the departure of Mark Hurd," Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein 
Research wrote in a report Monday. 
Building out the portfolio 
For H-P, ArcSight will bring another tool to the company's widening portfolio of technology products and services 
aimed at corporations. 
Like other large tech firms such as Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO, US), Oracle Corp. (ORCL, US) and Dell Inc. 
(DELL, US), H-P is pushing hard for a bigger piece of the lucrative market for corporate data centers. Large 
companies that can offer a wide array of hardware, software and services are believed to have an advantage in 
this business. 
"The security market is large and growing at double-digit levels," said Bill Veghte, H-P's executive vice president 
for software and solutions, in a conference call on Monday. "It's an area where customers are looking for not only 
great software products, but the services and hardware around it to deliver coherent solutions."

Page 102 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
ArcSight will combine with H-P's management software to "give enterprises the ability to have the broadest view 
of all IT events happening in their enterprise of any single solution in the market today," according to Veghte. 
Regarding ArcSight, Lazard Capital analyst Joel Fishbein wrote in a note that other bidders are not expected, 
"given the premium paid and valuation above historical comparables." 
The analyst also said that, following Intel Corp.'s (INTC, US) recent deal to acquire security software maker 
McAfee Inc. (MFE, US), "we expect multiple expansion to continue in the small/midcap security group, particularly 
in names with high amounts of government exposure." 
Abhey Lamba of ISI Group said H-P is likely to remain acquisitive in this sector, as well as in the markets for 
systems management and data storage, even though the company added to the latter area through its acquisition 
of 3Par (PAR, US). 
"Within security, we believe the company could acquire more network-protection solutions, where it currently only 
owns TippingPoint," Lamba wrote. 
Too many deals? 
Still, some are concerned about the recent heavy pace of deal-making, as well as the prices H-P is paying for 
these companies. 
A bidding war with Dell drove the price of 3Par skywards. H-P sealed its agreement with 3Par at $33 per share in 
cash -- more than three times the company's share price before it announced its original merger agreement with 
Dell. 
Like ArcSight, 3Par had less than $200 million in sales for its most recent fiscal year. Minus the cash on 
ArcSight's and 3Par's balance sheets, H-P will be laying out about $3.6 billion for the two companies -- roughly 
equivalent to a single quarter's worth of operating cash flow generated by the high-tech giant. 
Sacconaghi of Bernstein described the ArcSight deal as "immaterial" to H-P's finances, adding that most of 
ArcSight's revenue is U.S.-based, which provides opportunities for international expansion. 
"Strategically the deal makes sense, and is consistent with H-P's long held aspiration to strengthen its software 
portfolio -- but it is financially immaterial," he wrote. 
Bachman of BMO said that along with a planned $10 billion share buyback, H-P's heavy spending may still be a 
cause of concern, despite the company's enormous size and financial strength. 
"While we anticipate that H-P will have strong [cash-flow] generating capabilities (over $10 billion a year for the 
next two years), we believe that H-P will likely be raising net debt considerably in the near future," he wrote. 
"More broadly, we believe that it would be prudent for H-P to slow the pace of acquisitions until the leadership 
search is concluded." 
Hewlett-Packard says it will buy ArcSight, a security and compliance-management firm, in a $1.5 billion deal that 
underscores the company’s continued efforts to expand in the corporate data-center market.

By Gabriel Madway and Liana Baker 
SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co agreed to buy security software 
company ArcSight Inc for $1.5 billion as the computer maker continued its spending spree on acquisitions while it 
hunts for a new chief executive. 
The transaction, announced on Monday, marked HP's second big deal since the departure of CEO Mark Hurd 
after a sexual harassment probe in August. It follows HP's victory in a bidding war against Dell Inc for data 
storage company 3PAR Inc . [ID:nN02238002] 
HP said it will pay $43.50 per share in cash for ArcSight, a 24 percent premium to its closing price last Friday. 
Analysts would not rule out rival bids for ArcSight, with potential suitors including IBM , Oracle and Cisco Systems 
The deal carries a breakup fee of $61 million, which ArcSight could pay HP to terminate the merger if it received a 
better offer. 
ArcSight's software helps companies protect their digital assets from cyber attacks and fraud, and aids in 
regulatory compliance. 
While many analysts said HP overpaid, they also said the deal fits with its broader enterprise strategy. But some 
questioned the company's financial discipline, given the leadership vacuum caused by Hurd's exit. 
"I think ArcSight is to a degree a unique asset, and it complements what the company is doing with the 
convergence of networking and their server and storage strategy," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Aaron Rakers. 
Rakers said that although the ArcSight deal was not huge in dollar terms, he would like to see HP take some time 
to digest its recent acquisitions, which also include Palm and 3Com. 
At $1.5 billion, HP paid 6.6 times ArcSight's expected fiscal 2011 revenue. 
Wedbush Securities analyst Kaushik Roy said that ArcSight would be a good fit for HP. But he also said that 
Hewlett-Packard overpaid, though not nearly to the degree it did with 3PAR, for which it agreed to pay $2.4 billion. 
But Roy wondered about the aggressive strategy of HP's board, spending billions on acquisitions in the absence 
of a CEO. 
"Investors are nervous about how the board is using the balance sheet," he said. 
"The board is trying to signal that we're in control, we're active, but at the same time it's better to focus on getting 
a new CEO," Roy said.

Page 104 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Analysts said Hurd was undoubtedly involved in talks for ArcSight before he was pushed out and then joined 
Oracle as a co-president. 
HP sued Hurd last week to block that move, saying his hiring by the rival technology company puts HP's trade 
secrets "in peril." [ID:nN07242144] 
BIDDING WAR? 
ArcSight shares rose 25 percent to close at $43.91 on the Nasdaq. The stock has risen 56 percent since the Wall 
Street Journal reported on Aug. 26 that ArcSight had put itself up for sale. HP's shares rose 6 cents to $38.26 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
Analysts said HP's rivals could come in with competing bids for ArcSight. Robust activity from options' buyers also 
pointed to that possibility. 
"We think that the options market does indicate a potential for a higher bid or bidding war," said Jon Najarian, a 
co-founder of online information site optionMonster.com in Chicago. 
"It wouldn't be surprising" Michael Holt, a Morningstar analyst, said about the likelihood of a rival offer. He said 
ArcSight could fit in a number of "tech titan" portfolios, including Dell. 
Cupertino, California-based ArcSight serves utilities, government agencies, financial services and 
telecommunications providers. 
The deal is the latest in a rash of consolidation in the security technology sector. Last month, Intel Corp agreed to 
buy McAfee Inc for $7.7 billion. In May, Symantec Corp bought Verisign Inc's payment authentication unit for 
about $1.3 billion [ID:nN19267038]. 
HP said on a conference call that buying ArcSight would not materially hurt its earnings per share in fiscal 2011. 
HP said it sees the ArcSight deal closing by year-end. 
HP executives said there was no change to their acquisition strategy and that the company was comfortable with 
its balance sheet and ability to generate cash. 
ArcSight's biggest shareholders are Fidelity management which has a stake of almost 15 percent, and Kleiner, 
Perkins, Caufield & Byers, which has a nearly 11 pct stake, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Goldman Sachs advised HP on the transaction. ArcSight was advised by Morgan Stanley. (Reporting by Gabriel

* Deal could be announced on Monday -WSJ 
* Second major HP deal since Hurd's exit (Recasts, adds details on recent tech deals, HP's acquisition of 3PAR) 
NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co is nearing a deal to buy cybersecurity company ArcSight 
Inc for about $1.5 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, the latest in a series of tech sector 
transactions. 
ArcSight drew interest from several large tech companies and had been seeking around $42 per share, the 
Journal reported, citing unnamed sources. A deal could be announced as soon as Monday, the paper reported on 
its website. 
ArcSight shares closed at $35.10 on Friday. 
HP declined to comment. ArcSight was not immediately available for comment. 
A deal would be HP's second major acquisition since the departure of Mark Hurd as chief executive, showing the 
technology giant remains aggressive in pursuing growth despite the turmoil in the corner office. 
Hurd, who left HP after he was accused of falsifying expense reports and concealing a relationship with a female 
contractor, is now a co-president at Oracle Corp . 
Earlier this month, HP won a bidding war against rival Dell Inc to buy data storage company 3PAR Inc for $2.4 
billion, in a deal that gave 3PAR a rich valuation. [ID:nN02238002] 
The deal would also be the latest sign of consolidation in the security software sector. Last month, Intel Corp 
agreed to buy McAfee Inc for $7.7 billion. In May, Symantec Corp bought Verisign Inc's payment authentication 
unit for about $1.3 billion. [ID:nN19267038] (Reporting by Clare Baldwin and Paritosh Bansal; Editing by

SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones)--Hewlett Packard Co. (HPQ) is actively interviewing candidates to fill its vacant 
chief executive spot, a move that comes as the hardware-and-services giant seeks to expand its position in the 
technology world through acquisitions. 
"We've been very pleased with the selection of candidates," Interim Chief Executive Cathie Lesjak said at a 
technology conference Wednesday. She said the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company had received more applicants 
than initially expected. 
H-P's former chief executive, Mark Hurd, left abruptly last month after questions were raised about his personal 
conduct. Monday, Hurd was appointed as co-president of database giant Oracle Corp. (ORCL), a move that 
rankled H-P. H-P subsequently filed a lawsuit against Hurd and 25 other unnamed defendants. 
"We have not filed suit against Oracle, we have actually filed suit against Mark," Lesjak said. She added that 
while the relationship between the two companies is currently strained, they will likely continue working as 
partners in some areas. 
Lesjak said the company is still committed to cost savings, a trademark of Hurd's leadership style. The company's 
2011 business plan is already in place and hews closely to the tight cost-control model that has been in place for 
the last several years, she said. 
Lesjak said H-P hadn't overpaid in the highly-publicized bidding war with Dell Inc. (DELL) for data storage maker 
3Par Inc. (PAR). She said H-P's final bid was below its "walkaway price," a price at which 3Par would have been 
deemed too expensive. Lesjak did not say what the walkaway price was. 
3Par's margins will likely raise H-P's operating margins once its technologies and products are added to H-P's 
offerings, Lesjak said.

As Dell and H-P went back and forth, raising 3Par's purchase price, analysts and industry experts continually 
questioned how much value high-end data storage truly had, and whether the final purchase price of roughly $2.1 
billion was justified. 
Lesjak said H-P was confident in 3Par's value, and that it expects cloud storage business to grow in the future. 
H-P shares were recently down 3.66% to $38.46.

H-P Outguns Dell in Takeover Duel 
H-P Outguns Dell in Takeover Duel

It wasn't the biggest bidding war the tech world has ever seen. But when it ended Thursday morning -- after 10 
days of all-night strategy sessions, hardball phone negotiations and power naps on couches -- the battle between 
titans Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc. for a humble maker of data-storage systems certainly qualified as one of 
the wildest ever. 
Winner H-P and runner-up Dell both offered fat premiums for 3PAR Inc. The company traded for less than $10 a 
share before Dell announced its intent to acquire it on Aug 16. H-P's winning $2.1 billion offer, or $33 a share, far 
surpasses Dell's original $1.1 billion bid. H-P and Dell both say they wanted 3PAR, a player in the fast-growing 
field of "cloud computing," to help drive their growth. 
The frenzy sent 3PAR stock soaring into the stratosphere, more than tripling in just over two weeks. The bids 
went "into a land of dreamed-up future payoff," said Rob Cihra, an analyst at Caris & Co. In the end, he said, the 
bidding crossed the line into "a battle for pride more than 3PAR." 
The duel was far from settled as recently as late Wednesday, said people familiar with the matter, as Dell 
vacillated between dropping out and pushing forward with yet another proposal for 3PAR. 
Dell's bankers and lawyers had already worked around the clock for more than 48 hours on several proposals that 
they sent to 3PAR's advisers, snatching only a few hours of sleep in between. Late Wednesday, Dell considered 
withdrawing from the bidding entirely. Then it changed course, and launched a $32-a-share offer that came with a 
new set of conditions attached. 
Even as Dell agonized, H-P's executives and advisers monitored Dell's moves through "the grapevine," said a 
person familiar with the matter. After hearing Dell might have a revised proposal, H-P moved ahead with a 
$33-a-share offer that it had prepared several days earlier to preempt a further escalation of the bidding war. H-P 
had been "sitting on its hands for five days," long enough to have sketched out its responses to Dell's potential 
moves, this person said. 
Tech titans H-P and Dell have a history of feuding. They have often poached one another's executives. H-P 
overtook Dell as the world's largest PC maker by units in late 2006. They have both been mining the same 
territory to expand into new businesses. 
This latest drama unfolded simultaneously in Dell's headquarters in Round Rock, Tex.; in H-P's Palo Alto, Calif., 
headquarters; 3PAR's offices in Fremont, Calif.; and in white-shoe investment banking offices in San Francisco 
and New York. Top executives such as Dell chief executive Michael Dell were kept constantly apprised on the 
fast-moving talks via email and phone briefings, said people familiar with the matter. 
Bidding wars and hostile takeovers were once anathema in Silicon Valley, where deal-makers preferred to 
negotiate friendly arrangements between companies that shared similar work cultures. But as tech darlings such 
as Oracle Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. have become sprawling, maturing behemoths, their 
search for new sources of growth has introduced an era of more combative deal-making. 
Oracle was one of the first companies to employ the hostile tactic -- buying rival PeopleSoft in 2004 after an 
18-month pursuit. Last year, International Business Machines Corp. was close to a deal to buy Sun Microsystems 
when Oracle swooped in at the last minute with a winning $7.4 billion bid. Not long after, EMC Corp. fought rival 
NetApp Inc. over Data Domain, a niche storage-technology company that it had coveted. Data Domain, which 
initially agreed to sell itself to NetApp for $25 a share, or $1.5 billion, eventually went to EMC for $33.50 per 
share, or about $2.4 billion.

3PAR is particularly prized because it makes storage products that are part of the field of "cloud computing," in 
which businesses store information in data centers operated by specialists and access that information over the 
Internet. A spokesman for 3PAR declined to comment. 
The lofty winning offer translates to hefty riches for 3PAR investors including venture-capital firms Mayfield Fund, 
Menlo Ventures and Worldview Technology Partners. In addition, mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments is among 
3PAR's biggest institutional shareholders. Among individuals, 3PAR CEO David Scott, who is a former H-P 
executive, will reap around $100 million for his stake in the company. 
Founded in 1999, 3PAR went public in 2007 and had been in the sights of H-P and Dell for some time. While 
3PAR had posted losses for its past three fiscal years, it was considered a growth company -- posting $194 
million in revenue its fiscal year ended in March, up from $118 million two years earlier -- with a hot technology. 
On July 8, H-P contacted 3PAR about a potential acquisition, and executives from the two companies -- including 
3PAR CEO Mr. Scott and then H-P CEO Mark Hurd -- met to discuss the parameters of a possible deal the next 
week. 3PAR's directors quickly hired Qatalyst Partners LLP, which is run by industry insider Frank Quattrone. 
That same month, Qatalyst, which declined to comment, ran a mini-auction for 3PAR. In addition to Dell, which 
3PAR had held discussions with about a reselling partnership, the bankers invited two more companies to join the 
bidding, which people familiar with the matter identified as Oracle and NetApp. 
Oracle and NetApp soon dropped out, leaving Dell and H-P. In late July, H-P and Dell put in their first offers, with 
Dell indicating it would pay $15 to $17 a share and H-P's offer in the "mid-teens," said people familiar with the 
matter. 
Dell soon agreed to pay $18 per share, if 3PAR entered into two weeks of exclusive negotiations, according to 
regulatory filings. 3PAR's advisers asked H-P if it would raise its offer, but H-P declined on Aug. 1, partly because 
it wasn't convinced of the seriousness of another suitor's interest in 3PAR, people familiar with the matter said. 
On Aug. 16, Dell announced its intent to acquire 3PAR for $18 a share. With 62.5 million shares outstanding, the 
bid was valued at about $1.1 billion. That might have been the end of the story, especially since less than two 
weeks earlier, H-P CEO Mr. Hurd unexpectedly announced his resignation. Typically, when a company loses its 
chief, all strategic business is put on hold until a replacement is named. Not so in this case. 
When H-P learned it was up against Dell, said people familiar with the matter, a team of executives laid out the 
steps they would take to thwart their rival's every possible move. A person familiar with the matter said H-P's 
board had pre-approved a deal for 3PAR so that the company's executives were free to make new bids without 
first getting clearance from the board. 
On Aug. 23, H-P offered $24 per share for 3PAR. 
Dell's original agreement with 3PAR gave it the right to match any counteroffer, and it came back with a 
$24.30-a-share bid the following day. 
But H-P was "in this to win it," a person familiar with the matter said last week. Last week, H-P twice raised its bid 
in $3 increments, eventually offering $30 per share, or about $2 billion. 
At Dell, mergers and strategy chief Dave Johnson, along with Mr. Dell and other senior members of the deals 
team and adviser Credit Suisse, considered several options to save its deal to buy 3PAR via conference calls, 
text messages and emails, according to people familiar with the matter. As a Wednesday deadline for Dell's 
response approached, some advisers pulled all-nighters at the office, sneaking in power naps on office couches. 
Late Wednesday, Dell put forth its final revised proposal for 3PAR, indicating it would pay up to $32 a share if 
3PAR's board agreed to include a commercial agreement and a $92 million break-up fee. But 3PAR's board 
balked at the idea of a commercial agreement that would have required 3PAR to sell equipment to Dell even if 
H-P were to buy the company, said a person familiar with the matter. 
Early Thursday, Dell decided to drop out entirely, after 3PAR's board rebuffed its revised proposal yet again, 
people familiar with the matter said. 
But H-P had heard word that Dell had a revised proposal in the works, people familiar with the matter say. H-P 
executives and advisers, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., grew worried when no announcement came. 
Through the night, the H-P camp pumped their sources to figure out what Dell might be planning, even as Dell 
and 3PAR continued to negotiate, these people said.

Around 8:30 a.m. Thursday morning, H-P representatives called 3PAR preemptively and bumped their offer to 
$33 a share, people familiar with the matter said. 3PAR's Mr. Scott was in a London restaurant looking for a quiet 
corner where he could dial into a board meeting to make a final decision, when the offer came in. About nine 
hours later, the two sides had struck a deal.

Dell hands victory to HP in fight for 3PAR; Computing giant's $33-a-share bid secures data storage

HEWLETT-PACKARD has scored a victory in $2.4bn (£1.6bn) dollar bidding war for data storage company 3PAR, 
after Dell said it was pulling out of the race. 
Dell, which had secured the backing of 3PAR's board for a deal less than three weeks ago, said it had taken "a 
measured approach throughout the process and had decided to end these discussions". 
3PAR will have to pay Dell a $72m break fee after the computer manufacturer ended its participation in the 
bidding process. 
After a turbulent day for shareholders in all three companies, 3PAR, which is based in Fremont, California, said 
that HP's latest $33-a-share offer valuing 3PAR at $2.4bn was the superior one. 
The fight for 3PAR has seen repeated back-and-forth bidding since Dell made its first offer at $18 a share on 
August 16. 
HP's triumphant offer is more than three times the price at which 3PAR's shares were trading before Dell 
announced its bid, and is likely to raise some questions over whether it is paying too high a premium. 
According to Bloomberg data, the winning bid values 3PAR at 325 times its earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation, higher than an average ratio of 16 seen in recent deals in the industry. 
However, HP is betting that with a sales force stretching across the globe, it will be able to accelerate 3PAR's 
growth rapidly. 
The failure to land the deal is a blow to Dell, which is under pressure from investors to return the company to the 
heady era of growth it formerly enjoyed. Once the world's largest computer manufacturer, Dell lost that title to HP 
after it acquired Compaq. 
Dell and HP battled so hard for 3PAR because the data storage market it operates in is an expanding one, and 
their target produces both hardware and software that makes it cheaper for companies to store data 
electronically. The amount of data produced is doubling every 18 months, say analysts, and the market is led by 
US rival EMC. 
While 3PAR would still be a small part of HP's $115bn-ayear business, the aggressive bidding war showed how 
crucial data storage is becoming as increasing volumes of emails, online video and electronic business 
transactions put a strain on corporate data centres. 
Some industry pundits say that establishing a foothold in the sector now and having storage technology, along 
with servers and networking equipment, could mean the difference between becoming one of the top five 
technology vendors in the long run, alongside IBM and Cisco, or a mere secondary supplier. 
The deal adds to a flurry of merger and acquisition activity in recent weeks, underlining the fact that companies 
sitting on cash will spend it if they can secure the right targets.

HP's victory caps what has been a troubled period for the computing giant. It remains without a chief executive 
after Mark Hurd stepped down last month following an investigation into his links with the former adult film 
actress Jodie Fisher, who worked as a corporate hospitality contractor for the company.

Spectacle of HP, Dell showdown for 3Par comes to an end after HP makes pricey bid 
Spectacle of HP, Dell showdown for 3Par comes to an end after HP makes pricey bid

SAN FRANCISCO _ The showdown over 3Par Inc. that ended Thursday was a puzzling spectacle. 
It pitted two of the world's biggest technology companies against each other for control of a company that was 
obscure outside of technology circles and flat-out unloved on Wall Street, with a stock that was stuck around 
US$10 for a year and a half. 
3Par, which was founded 11 years ago by former Sun Microsystems managers, was seen as a takeover 
candidate well before Dell Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. started bidding on it in mid-August. The company's 
uneven financial performance dampened investors' enthusiasm despite the fact it is in the lucrative market for 
``virtualized storage,'' which is an important technology for companies that sell services over the Internet. 
What wasn't anticipated was the ferocity of the wrestling match for a company that was seen as only tangential to 
HP's and Dell's core businesses. 
The bidding contest revealed more about HP and Dell and the changing technology landscape than it did about 
the innovations that 3Par brings to the table. 
HP won 3Par with an offer of $2.07 billion, or $33 per share, which is more than three times what 3Par's stock 
was trading at when rival Dell Inc. made its first offer Aug. 16. Dell said Thursday it is walking away from the 
negotiations after a final bid of $2 billion, or $32 per share. 
Many analysts were surprised the bidding went so high. 
``At this price, it's a little ridiculous,'' said Jayson Noland, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. ``To me, it tells 
you how far behind HP and Dell are in storage, not necessarily how incredible an asset 3Par is.'' 
Technologies from 3Par will be part of HP's expansion beyond personal computers and printer ink. HP's former 
CEO, Mark Hurd, aggressively pursued that expansion, and many industry analysts saw HP's intensity in 
pursuing 3Par as evidence that the company wanted to prove that it can still close big deals. 
``They're sending a clear message that, 'We're in transition but we're not missing a step,''' said Nina Buik, chief 
marketing officer for Connect Worldwide, an organization of more than 50,000 customers of HP's 
business-technology products. ``They're wanting to instil confidence, and mission accomplished.'' 
HP's tender offer is scheduled to expire on Sept. 24, and the acquisition is expected to close by the end of this 
year. 
Before Dell made its first offer, 3Par stock was trading at just under $10 per share. It closed Thursday's regular 
trading session at $32.88 per share, just below HP's latest offer price. 
Meanwhile, HP's stock during that time has fallen 2 per cent to close at $39.68 Thursday. Dell's stock has risen 
three per cent to $12.36. 
3Par is based in Fremont, Calif., and employs 670 people. It went public three years ago at $14 per share. HP is 
based in Palo Alto, Calif., and has about 300,000 employees.

Hewlett-Packard has won the bidding war to buy data storage company 3PAR for USD 2.4bn, after the withdrawal 
of rival Dell. 
HP had raised its cash offer by USD 3 to USD 33 per share, beating Dell's USD 32-a-share offer and ending an 
escalation of bids that many analysts said had gone too far. 
3PAR shares closed up 2.5pc on the New York Stock Exchange last night. They had mostly traded around USD 
10 this year, until Dell announced its initial USD 18 per share bid in mid-August. 
The deal values 3PAR at over eight times sales, and many analysts said that was too high for a company that has 
barely ever made a profit since it was founded in 1999. Multiples above five are considered lofty in technology 
deals. Others, however, say 3PAR is worth it. The company competes with bigger rival EMC Corp in data storage, 
considered a key part of "cloud computing" -- an increasingly popular technology that enables computer users to 
access data and software over the Internet, allowing companies to cut costs. Such technology is seen 
increasingly crucial as emails, online video and electronic business transactions put a strain on corporate data 
centers. HP's vast and global sales force could quickly turn 3PAR into a bigger, more profitable business, some 
said. "Do I think it was an extremely rich valuation? Absolutely. But I think, given that it's all cash, it shouldn't take 
too long for it to be accretive," said Stifel Nicolaus and Co analyst Aaron Rakers. "The question is, what kind of 
revenue synergy assumptions are they making?" HP's aggressive bidding also showed it had no intention to be 
sidelined from deals in the absence of a CEO. Mark Hurd resigned last month as chief executive in a scandal 
surrounding inaccurate expense reports related to a female marketing contractor. (c) Reuters

18-month pursuit. Last year, International Business Machines Corp. was close to a deal to buy Sun Microsystems 
when Oracle swooped in at the last minute with a winning $7.4 billion bid. Not long after, EMC Corp. fought rival 
NetApp Inc. over Data Domain, a niche storage-technology company that it had coveted. Data Domain, which 
initially agreed to sell itself to NetApp for $25 a share, or $1.5 billion, eventually went to EMC for $33.50 per 
share, or about $2.4 billion.

3PAR is particularly prized because it makes storage products that are part of the field of "cloud computing," in 
which businesses store information in data centers operated by specialists and access that information over the 
Internet. A spokesman for 3PAR declined to comment. 
The lofty winning offer translates to hefty riches for 3PAR investors including venture-capital firms Mayfield Fund, 
Menlo Ventures and Worldview Technology Partners. In addition, mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments is among 
3PAR's biggest institutional shareholders. Among individuals, 3PAR CEO David Scott, who is a former H-P 
executive, will reap around $100 million for his stake in the company. 
Founded in 1999, 3PAR went public in 2007 and had been in the sights of H-P and Dell for some time. While 
3PAR had posted losses for its past three fiscal years, it was considered a growth company—posting $194 million 
in revenue its fiscal year ended in March, up from $118 million two years earlier—with a hot technology. 
On July 8, H-P contacted 3PAR about a potential acquisition, and executives from the two companies—including 
3PAR CEO Mr. Scott and then H-P CEO Mark Hurd—met to discuss the parameters of a possible deal the next 
week. 3PAR's directors quickly hired Qatalyst Partners LLP, which is run by industry insider Frank Quattrone. 
That same month, Qatalyst, which declined to comment, ran a mini-auction for 3PAR. In addition to Dell, which 
3PAR had held discussions with about a reselling partnership, the bankers invited two more companies to join the 
bidding, which people familiar with the matter identified as Oracle and NetApp. 
Oracle and NetApp soon dropped out, leaving Dell and H-P. In late July, H-P and Dell put in their first offers, with 
Dell indicating it would pay $15 to $17 a share and H-P's offer in the "mid-teens," said people familiar with the 
matter. 
Dell soon agreed to pay $18 per share, if 3PAR entered into two weeks of exclusive negotiations, according to 
regulatory filings. 3PAR's advisers asked H-P if it would raise its offer, but H-P declined on Aug. 1, partly because 
it wasn't convinced of the seriousness of another suitor's interest in 3PAR, people familiar with the matter said. 
On Aug. 16, Dell announced its intent to acquire 3PAR for $18 a share. With 62.5 million shares outstanding, the 
bid was valued at about $1.1 billion. That might have been the end of the story, especially since less than two 
weeks earlier, H-P CEO Mr. Hurd unexpectedly announced his resignation. Typically, when a company loses its 
chief, all strategic business is put on hold until a replacement is named. Not so in this case. 
When H-P learned it was up against Dell, said people familiar with the matter, a team of executives laid out the 
steps they would take to thwart their rival's every possible move. A person familiar with the matter said H-P's 
board had pre-approved a deal for 3PAR so that the company's executives were free to make new bids without 
first getting clearance from the board. 
On Aug. 23, H-P offered $24 per share for 3PAR. 
Dell's original agreement with 3PAR gave it the right to match any counteroffer, and it came back with a 
$24.30-a-share bid the following day. 
But H-P was "in this to win it," a person familiar with the matter said last week. Last week, H-P twice raised its bid 
in $3 increments, eventually offering $30 per share, or about $2 billion. "It was just adrenaline that kept people 
going," said one person familiar with the matter. 
At Dell, mergers and strategy chief Dave Johnson, along with Mr. Dell and other senior members of the deals 
team and adviser Credit Suisse, considered several options to save its deal to buy 3PAR via conference calls, 
text messages and emails, according to people familiar with the matter. As a Wednesday deadline for Dell's 
response approached, some advisers pulled all-nighters at the office, sneaking in power naps on office couches. 
Late Wednesday, Dell put forth its final revised proposal for 3PAR, indicating it would pay up to $32 a share if 
3PAR's board agreed to include a commercial agreement and a $92 million break-up fee. But 3PAR's board 
balked at the idea of a commercial agreement that would have required 3PAR to sell equipment to Dell even if 
H-P were to buy the company, said a person familiar with the matter. 
Early Thursday, Dell decided to drop out entirely, after 3PAR's board rebuffed its revised proposal yet again, 
people familiar with the matter said. 
But H-P had heard word that Dell had a revised proposal in the works, people familiar with the matter say. H-P 
executives and advisers, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., grew worried when no announcement came.

Through the night, the H-P camp pumped their sources to figure out what Dell might be planning, even as Dell 
and 3PAR continued to negotiate, these people said. 
Around 8:30 a.m. Thursday morning, H-P representatives called 3PAR preemptively and bumped their offer to 
$33 a share, people familiar with the matter said. 3PAR's Mr. Scott was walking up the stairs in a London 
restaurant to find a quiet corner where he could dial into a board meeting to make a final decision, when the offer 
came in. About nine hours later, the two sides had struck a deal.

It's Dave vs. Dave in bidding for 3PAR 
It's Dave vs. Dave in bidding for 3PAR

As the bidding war between Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc. for storage maker 3PAR Inc. reaches its latest 
deadline, some of the key decisions are being made by two executives named Dave seeking to make their marks 
at the companies: Dave Donatelli at H-P and Dave Johnson at Dell. 
They share more than a name. Both graduated from Boston College and worked at East Coast technology giants 
for more than two decades -- Mr. Donatelli at EMC Corp. and Mr. Johnson at International Business Machines 
Corp. Both left their longtime employers last year -- and in both cases their exits triggered lawsuits, which were 
resolved but prevented the executives from working in their areas of specialty temporarily. 
Now both men are helping to drive the bidding war for 3PAR, a Fremont, Calif., storage-technology company that 
is part of the fast-growing sector of the technology industry known as cloud computing. 
Dell said in August it agreed to acquire 3PAR for $18 a share, or $1.2 billion. H-P then jumped into the fray with a 
competing bid, prompting an escalating series of offers from both tech behemoths. H-P's latest $30-per-share 
offer for 3PAR values the company at about $2 billion . 3PAR's board deemed H-P's offer superior late Friday, 
and set a Sept. 1 deadline for Dell to match or top H-P's offer. 
While Dell is reluctant to drop a storage asset it prizes highly, its executives are debating the merits of continuing 
a bidding war with H-P, especially given H-P's seeming determination to trounce any bid, said people familiar with 
the matter. Dell could decide to raise its offer by several dollars in a last-ditch attempt to win 3PAR or drop its bid 
entirely, these people said. 
If it decides to walk away, Dell could seek alternative partnerships to enhance the storage-related products it 
offers customers, the people said. 
H-P and Dell declined to make Messrs. Donatelli and Johnson available for interviews Tuesday. 
In an interview last week, Mr. Donatelli said a 3PAR deal would further H-P's goal of offering every component of 
the data center -- which is a back-end computer room -- to customers. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Johnson, age 56, said in an interview last week that a deal for 3PAR would help Dell expand its 
sales to third-party data-center operators and companies looking to get into cloud computing. 
A deal "will be a winner for our shareholders," he said. 
Both Daves have been highly active on the 3PAR deal. Mr. Donatelli has been working closely with H-P's 
mergers-and-acquisitions team to plot its next moves, said a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Johnson has 
been in constant contact with 3PAR's top executives, according to regulatory filings. 
"Donatelli is not going to lose this deal," said Steve Duplessie, an analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group, who once 
worked with the 45-year-old Mr. Donatelli and now follows him as an analyst. 
Mr. Donatelli, a storage expert, spent 22 years at storage company EMC, including a stint as president of EMC's 
storage division. When he left to join H-P last year, it was widely regarded as a move to boost his profile as a 
future chief-executive candidate. His move triggered a lawsuit from EMC, which argued the defection violated his 
noncompete clause. In the end, Mr. Donatelli joined H-P but was barred briefly from working in storage.

Page 119 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
One person familiar with Mr. Donatelli says his management style is focused on the bottom line, just like former 
H-P CEO Mark Hurd, who resigned suddenly in August. 
"Briefing Donatelli was like briefing Hurd," this person said. "You better start with the numbers and they better be 
good." 
Meanwhile, Mr. Johnson was a 27-year veteran at IBM, where he specialized in mergers and acquisitions. He 
was recruited in 2009 as Dell's senior vice president of corporate strategy by CEO Michael Dell to help transform 
Dell into a well-rounded technology company that values intellectual property, said Matt Eastwood, an analyst at 
research company IDC. 
Dell bought services provider Perot Systems Corp. for $3.9 billion after Mr. Johnson joined the company, but the 
executive didn't work on that deal because Dell wanted to be conservative with Mr. Johnson in the wake of his 
separation from IBM, which prompted a lawsuit. The 3PAR deal is Mr. Johnson's first big foray for Dell. 
Adds a person familiar with Mr. Johnson, "Dave Johnson was hired to turn Dell into a technology company from a 
distribution company." 
At IBM, Mr. Johnson didn't like to get involved in auctions, said someone familiar with his style, though that may 
have been related to IBM's conservative deal-making approach. In recent years, IBM was outbid by Oracle Corp. 
for Sun Microsystems Inc. and by Cisco Systems Inc. for Webex.

* Donatelli led HP's bid for 3PAR 
* Analysts see him as eventual, if not next, CEO 
* Previously worked at EMC for 22 years 
By Ritsuko Ando 
NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co's fierce bidding war against Dell Inc for 3PAR Inc raised the 
profile of the once-obscure data storage business, and along with it the stature of HP executive Dave Donatelli. 
Donatelli, who as head of enterprise servers, storage and networking marshaled the winning bid, is seen as one 
of the candidates to succeed Mark Hurd, the high-profile HP chief who stepped down on Aug. 6 after a probe into 
his relationship with a contractor. [ID:nN06147588] 
The 45-year-old Donatelli is known among former colleagues and analysts as an aggressive and highly effective 
executive who was schooled by the hard-driving culture of EMC Corp , his former employer and bigger rival to 
3PAR. 
Donatelli's strength is his knowledge of enterprise technology like storage and networking, where HP is seeking to 
expand and faces tough competition from other large vendors like IBM and Cisco Systems Inc . 
"He's technically very strong in terms of being able to run very large-scale engineering," said Highland Capital 
Partners' Peter Bell, who used to work with Donatelli at EMC. 
A graduate of Boston College with an MBA from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, 
Donatelli spent 22 years at EMC before joining HP last year, a move that prompted a lawsuit by EMC. 
Some analysts said that he may not be chosen for the CEO role this time around because it has been only a year 
since he joined, and the board may want a more veteran HP executive like Ann Livermore, who oversees the 
overall enterprise business, or Shane Robison, chief strategy and technology officer. 
But they said Donatelli's relative youth means he is likely to eventually get the job, and his success at steering its 
bid for 3PAR lends him more credibility as a future leader. 
BATTLE OF THE BIGGEST 
While 3PAR would still be a small part of HP's $115 billion-a-year business, the aggressive bidding war showed 
how crucial data storage is becoming as increasing volumes of emails, online video and electronic business 
transactions put a strain on corporate data centers. [ID:nN02121852] 
Some say having storage technology, along with servers and networking equipment, could mean the difference 
between becoming one of the top five technology vendors in the long run alongside IBM and Cisco, or a mere 
secondary supplier. 
Analysts said Donatelli's experience in M&A and bringing new technologies to the business will help HP compete 
with IBM and others that are expanding into new products and services.

Page 121 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"It's all about convergence, consolidation, and he's at the center of all that," said one analyst at an investment firm 
that owns HP shares. 
The analyst, who declined to be named, also said investors were unlikely to criticize Donatelli for the high price for 
3PAR -- more than three times what it was worth before Dell's first public bid -- as long as the overall company 
keeps growing. 
Wedbush Securities analyst Kaushik Roy was more critical, saying HP was spending too much and was better off 
buying other, cheaper companies. But he also rated Donatelli, whom he had worked for at EMC, as a person who 
could get things done. 
"He grew up at EMC. And EMC was a small company that grew very fast, because it has good technology and 
aggressive sales people. Donatelli is like that -- he's an aggressive guy and he can execute," he said. 
Donatelli also led HP's acquisition of network equipment maker 3Com, a $2.7 billion deal that helped it expand 
into routers and switches and boost its presence in China, one of the world's fastest-growing markets. 
[ID:nN11380084] 
That deal pitted HP against Cisco, previously a resale partner. Cisco has in turn entered HP's territory of servers. 
Such encroachments are now increasingly common as vendors try to become one-stop shops for their clients' 
technology needs. That means whoever leads HP must be able to strike a delicate balance between aggressive 
dealmaking and cooperating with partners, analysts said. 
Highland Capital's Bell said Donatelli, whom he described as a straight talker and solid decision maker, had the 
right character for the job. 
"When you have thousands of people working for you, do they believe in what you're telling them? Can you build 
a good team, and can you hire executives well? Are you good in front of customers? Are you technically strong? 
Those are all things that Dave's got," he said. 
Hurd was credited with resuscitating HP through bold acquisitions and cost cuts, helping transform the company 
into the world's largest tech company by revenue. He shocked Silicon Valley by resigning last month in a cloud of 
scandal surrounding inaccurate expense reports related to a female marketing contractor. (Reporting by Ritsuko

TECH VIEW: H-P Pays Dearly To Keep 3Par Out Of Dell's Hands 
TECH VIEW: H-P Pays Dearly To Keep 3Par Out Of Dell's Hands

Last night, in front of Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco, a group of computer geeks were taking turns 
flying 25-feet through the air on a bungee-jumping setup during a party at the VMworld show. 
They might as well have been investors in 3Par Inc. (PAR), who today are jumping up and down over the 
outcome of the bidding war between Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Dell Inc. (DELL) (all of which also had a 
presence at VMware Inc.'s (VMW) big user conference on virtualization and cloud computing in the data center). 
But when the dust settles after this bidding frenzy, H-P might regret its final price--$2.4 billion, or $33 a share--for 
a company with just under $200 million in revenue, and whose stock was trading under the $10 mark just weeks 
ago before the madness started. 
It appears that without former Chief Executive Mark Hurd and his fiscal disciplinarian stance, H-P's board and its 
top executives might have run a bit amok with this bid, partly in order to keep the company out of Dell's reach. 
For Dell's part, it is now entitled to a break-up fee of $72 million, and there is no shortage of other 
storage-in-the-cloud companies to choose from. In recent weeks, analysts have dug up the names of other 3Par 
rivals that might fit the bill to help round out Dell's data center storage needs. 
Today, the big winners are 3Par shareholders, and the investment bankers who managed to pull this deal 
off--most notably Frank Quattrone's Qatalyst Partners, which represents 3Par. Selling a $10 stock for $33 is no 
small feat, though the willingness of buyers to pay just about any price always helps.

HP outlasts Dell in bidding war for 3PAR

US computer giant Hewlett-Packard emerged the winner on Thursday in a bidding war with Dell for 3PAR after 
raising its offer for the data storage company to 33 dollars per share or 2.35 billion dollars. 
HP and 3PAR make a "winning combination," HP executive vice president Dave Donatelli said in a joint statement 
confirming the deal was done and had been approved by boards of directors at both firms. 
HP expected 3PAR technology to "bolster our ability to provide customers with the industry's highest levels of 
performance, efficiency and reliability," said Donatelli, manager of Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking at 
HP. 
"We intend to invest in 3PAR's technology," he added. 
Dave Johnson, Dell's senior vice president for corporate strategy, announced the Round Rock, Texas-based 
company's decision to pull out of the bidding which began on August 16 with an 18-dollar per share offer for 
3PAR by Dell. 
"We took a measured approach throughout the process and have decided to end these discussions," Johnson 
said in a statement. 
Dell dropped its attempt to acquire the Fremont, California-based 3PAR after HP topped its final offer of 32 dollars 
per share. 
The 3PAR board of directors had recommended accepting an earlier offer from Dell but decided to terminate their 
merger agreement and accept the "superior" offer from the Palo Alto, California-based HP. 
Dell said it is entitled to receive a 72-million-dollar break-up fee from 3PAR as a result of the company's decision 
to go with the HP bid. 
HP, the world's largest computer manufacturer, and Dell, the third-largest, are both seeking to expand their 
offerings to include services and storage. 
With the rise of Internet-based "cloud computing," in which data is stored remotely, 3PAR was an attractive target 
and the bidding war for the company saw its stock triple in two weeks. 
"3PAR has built a reputation for delivering enterprises and cloud computing service providers the ability to do 
more with less," said 3PAR chief executive David Scott. 
"As part of HP, 3PAR's agile, efficient storage solutions will truly thrive, particularly given HP's ability to accelerate 
investment in our products and reach new customers around the world." 
The acquisition of 3PAR gives HP an advantage over the market for advanced high-end data storage solutions, 
where 3PAR is the dominant player. 
3PAR's technology enables large companies and government agencies to shift to "cloud" storage platforms, 
significantly cutting storage costs. 
Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle said it was ultimately more important for HP to acquire 3PAR than it was for 
Dell and he expected Dell to now deepen its partnership with software giant Microsoft.

In a reference to the abrupt resignation last month of HP chief executive Mark Hurd, Enderle also said he found it 
"surprising that HP could do this without a CEO." 
HP chief financial officer Cathie Lesjak has been serving as interim chief executive since Hurd resigned on 
August 6 in the wake of a sexual harassment charge that uncovered subterfuge with company expenses. 
Shares in 3PAR gained 2.49 percent on Wall Street on Thursday to close at 32.88 dollars while HP gained 1.20 
percent to finish at 39.68 dollars and Dell gained 1.98 dollars to close at 12.36 dollars.

The sirens' song of low bond yields 
Extraordinarily low bond yields signal a grim economic outlook. But for governments, there is a silver lining. For a 
while at least, they can trim interest bills even as they ramp up borrowing. 
A combination of near-zero official policy rates, central-bank bond purchases, investor aversion to risk and 
worries about the economic recovery have driven yields in countries such as the U.S., the U.K. and Germany to 
historic lows. In the U.S., the Treasury recently auctioned two-year notes at a yield of just less than 0.5%; in the 
U.K., 10-year gilt yields have fallen below 3%; and in Germany, the 30-year bond yield has dropped to just 2.6%. 
For the U.S. in particular, given the short-term nature of much of its debt, declining yields have a big effect. In 
fiscal 2009, total interest paid on debt held by the public fell 22% on the year, to $189 billion, even as the amount 
of debt outstanding rose 30% to $7.6 trillion, according to the latest audit by the U.S. Government Accountability 
Office. Since then, average interest rates have declined further -- to just 0.2% on Treasury bills and 2.7% on 
notes of up to 10 years at the end of July. 
New debt is increasingly attractive for governments. In Europe, the current funding rate for Germany is some 2.3 
percentage points lower than the rate on the existing stock of debt, Citigroup calculates; for France it is 1.6 
percentage points lower. Even Spain, at the center of euro-zone bond-market worries, is borrowing more cheaply; 
it recently decided to reinstate 700 million euros ($891 million) of planned infrastructure spending, partly because 
of lower funding costs. 
Low core rates have knock-on effects throughout the economy, as government bonds are the underlying 
benchmarks for corporate borrowing rates. In the U.S., IBM recently raised funds at a record-low coupon of 1% 
for three years. In Europe, yields on euro-denominated nonfinancial bonds at 3.02% are at their lowest on record, 
according to BNP Paribas. Low government-bond yields are likely to push more investors into buying corporate 
bonds in an effort to hit return targets, ensuring a plentiful supply of cash for companies. 
But governments should remember silver linings can tarnish. In Japan, government debt is cheap, but continued 
deficits and deflation have led to a debt burden of more than 200% of gross domestic product. Overreliance on 
cheap short-term funding poses serious risks if inflation and the economy pick up. Rising yields will feed through 
to a much higher interest bill on the debt piled up in bad times. Low interest costs are a palliative, but they aren't a 
cure for the crisis.

The glory days may be over for HKEx 
It has been a good decade for Hong Kong Exchanges &Clearing, the city's stock-exchange operator. The next 10 
years are unlikely to shape up quite as well. 
The company's shares are up nearly 30-fold from when they were listed a little more than 10 years ago. In the 
same period, Hong Kong's broad market gauge, the Hang Seng Index, is up 28%. 
It reflects what could be called the HKEx's golden age: Between 2003 and 2007, China's biggest companies were 
listed in Hong Kong. Worth more than $68 billion, these accounted for more than half the value of initial public 
offerings in Hong Kong, Dealogic says. Alongside that, the market capitalization of stocks on the exchange 
ballooned, rising nearly tenfold to more than $2.2 trillion, according to data from World Federation of Exchanges.

Page 126 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
True, this flow hasn't entirely dried up. But the listing of Agricultural Bank of China in July -- which raised more 
money in an IPO than any other company in history -- may well turn out to mark the end of this era. 
Meanwhile, bread-and-butter trading activities aren't holding up terribly well. Average daily turnover has declined 
for four quarters in a row. Profits, naturally, are similarly sluggish, and analysts expect earnings per share to be 
unchanged this year from 2009. 
HKEx's plan to deal with this is to attract more overseas listings. It is also considering extending trading hours. It 
has had some success with the foreign listings, but certainly not enough to replace the volume of stock offerings 
that once flowed out of China. 
The exchange's share price has yet to reflect the full extent of this slowdown. HKEx shares trade at roughly 26 
times forecast 2010 earnings, which is high compared with the company's historic valuations, according to data 
from Starmine. It is also well over valuations afforded to other exchanges, though HKEx does have a monopoly 
that many others don't. 
There is much room for short-term disappointment. Analysts' forecasts are factoring in just under $10 billion in 
average daily turnover for the rest of 2010, DBS Vickers says. In the first half of the year, it was closer to $8 
billion, and in July and August even weaker. 
For HKEx, and its shareholders, it is time to get used to getting less from China.

With buy, Intel 
is accelerating 
the ARM race 
Is Intel inside? In your PC, most likely, but not your phone. That is a problem the chip maker wants to remedy with 
its recent acquisition spree, punctuated Monday by the purchase of German company Infineon Technologies' 
wireless business for $1.4 billion. 
Intel's push on mobile comes not a moment too soon. Intel dominates the market for PC chips, of course, but 
Friday's announcement that this quarter's results will be below previous estimates is a reminder how that 
business is nearing saturation. Intel says it is seeing "weaker than expected demand" -- not what investors like to 
hear. 
Previous forays into handsets have largely failed. Lately, the company has been trying to make inroads with its 
Atom chip. But Atom remains a tiny piece of Intel's overall business, driving just 4% of the June quarter's revenue. 
And it requires too much power to compete effectively in the handset market with chips based on technology from 
ARM Holdings. ARM had about 85% market share in handsets in 2009, according to Anil Doradla of William Blair. 
Smartphones have more than one chip, of course. Infineon is among the leaders supplying "baseband" chips that 
help phones connect to networks; these will nicely complement Atom chips, which, like ARM's, process 
applications. Infineon also has a good smartphone client list, supplying, for instance, $14 of equipment in each 
Apple iPhone 4, iSuppli says. And unlike its deal for antivirus maker McAfee, which was purchased for an 
eye-watering 40 times estimated 2010 earnings based on generally accepted accounting principles, Infineon's 
business looks cheaper at 10 times 2010 operating profit, according to Piper Jaffray estimates.

RPT-ANALYSIS-Dell expected to bow out of 3PAR bidding

(Repeats to additional subscribers) 
NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Dell Inc is widely expected to bow out of a bidding war with Hewlett-Packard Co 
for data storage company 3PAR Inc because of the increased price tag. 
A survey of eight technology investors and analysts by Reuters on Monday found most expect Dell to soon give 
up its pursuit of 3PAR, either ceding to HP's last offer of $30 per share or giving up at a few dollars higher at 
most. 
Dell has until Wednesday to match HP's $2 billion offer for the company, which analysts say would help speed up 
its expansion from personal computers into more profitable enterprise technology services. 
"Clearly both companies really want 3PAR as part of their product mix, and they've both recognized the 
importance of storage in these cloud computing architectures. But I think it's hard to compete with HP. They've 
got the bigger balance sheet," said Peter Bell at venture capital firm Highland Capital Partners. 
Analysts have said HP, with $115 billion of annual revenue compared with Dell's $53 billion, holds the advantage 
of a bigger check book. HP also has a bigger and more global sales force that could help 3PAR grow faster, 
meaning it would likely get a return on investment faster than Dell could. 
Dell said on Monday it was still assessing the situation and declined to comment further on negotiations. 
HP's bid was the most recent in a week-long volley of escalating offers, and people familiar with the matter told 
Reuters on Friday that the company has the financial firepower to go higher. [ID:nN29138050] 
Some said Dell may yet match the last bid, forcing HP to again raise its offer price. 
"It's definitely possible we might see another counter from Dell. But there's not a lot of headroom left," said 
Shannon Cross of Cross Research. 
Morningstar analyst Michael Holt said HP may be using this deal to make a statement that it is business as usual 
despite the recent departure of Chief Executive Mark Hurd. He said the same of the company's announcement of 
more share repurchases. [ID:nN30166684] 
"If Dell was hoping to take advantage of a void in leadership at its archrival, the gamble did not pay off," he said. 
HIGH VALUATION 
But some analysts said HP may end up with buyer's remorse after paying a high premium for 3PAR, whose stock 
price was hovering around $10 for most of the year until Dell's initial $18-a-share bid. The company has barely 
made a profit since its founding in 1999. 
But others say 3PAR is worth it. The company specializes in data storage, a key part of "cloud computing" -- an 
increasingly popular technology that enables computer users to access data and software over the Internet, 
allowing companies to cut costs. 
Some say a company like HP could easily double or triple 3PAR's sales in a few years, making it a smart deal.

"It looks like we've crossed the line of rational thinking," said Stifel Nicolaus & Co analyst Aaron Rakers, asked 
how much he thought the upper limit was. 
"But you never know what these companies are banking in in terms of revenue synergies." 
Moreover, some say, owning storage technology could mean the difference between being one of the top five 
technology vendors along with IBM and Cisco Systems Inc , or being ranked below them, in several years. 
3PAR competes with EMC Corp , Hitachi Ltd , NetApp Inc as well as International Business Machines Corp, but 
specializes in high-end products and its technology is not easy to replicate. 
HP's last offer on Friday of $30 per share beat out Dell's last offer of $27 per share, which had matched HP's 
previous offer. (Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)

You might think Hewlett-Packard would wait for Mark Hurd's permanent replacement before emptying its piggy 
bank. Winning 3PAR at its current lofty bid would drain $2 billion of cash. Now H-P has plans to buy back an extra 
$10 billion of stock. With its shares off 17% since Hurd's abrupt departure, now looks like a decent time to mop up 
stock. 
But unlike most tech giants, H-P had more debt than cash -- with the difference coming to $5.3 billion -- before its 
latest splurge. Share repurchases won't come all at once, but with plans for "at least" $3 billion this quarter, they 
will likely outpace free cash flow, suggesting the company is levering up. 
That's a million miles from two highfliers of the sector. Veteran CEOs at Apple and Google seem happy to let their 
cash mountains keep building up. Between them: $76 billion and counting.

Corporate News: H-P Settles Case For $55 Million

Hewlett-Packard Co. will pay $55 million to settle allegations that it paid kickbacks to win U.S. government 
business and other charges related to government contracts. 
Separately, H-P said Monday it will add $10 billion to its share-buyback program. 
Prior to the U.S. Justice Department's announcement of the settlement amount Monday, H-P said earlier this 
month that it would settle the kickback case, saying the pact would reduce earnings in its fiscal third quarter by 
about two cents a share. 
The Justice Department alleged that H-P knowingly paid "influencer fees" to systems-integrator companies in 
return for recommendations that federal agencies purchase H-P products. 
It also alleged that H-P's 2002 contract with the General Services Administration for computer equipment and 
software was defectively priced because the company provided incomplete information to contracting officers 
during negotiations. 
H-P denied that it engaged in any illegal conduct. "We believe it is in the best interest of our stakeholders to 
resolve the matter and move beyond this issue," it said in a statement Monday. 
The developments come as the Palo Alto, Calif., computer maker struggles through a turbulent month that has 
included the ouster of its chief executive officer and a 17% slide in its share price. 
H-P said Monday that its board had authorized an expansion of the existing $8 billion share buyback plan 
announced last year. The move is designed to offset the impact of shares being issued to employees, the 
company said. 
"We plan to be active in repurchasing our shares," Cathie Lesjak, H-P's chief financial officer and interim chief 
executive, said in a statement. The company plans to repurchase at least $3 billion worth of shares during its 
fiscal fourth quarter, which ends Oct. 31. 
H-P has roughly $4.9 billion left in its original share-buyback plan and repurchased $2.6 billion worth of its shares 
during the latest quarter. 
H-P also said Monday that it won a five-year purchase contract with the U.S. Air Force that could be worth up to 
$800 million. 
Under the agreement, H-P will provide the Air Force with desktop and notebook computers, displays and other 
products. 
Specific financial details of the Air Force contract weren't disclosed. 
H-P, which has $125 billion in annual revenue, said it has delivered more than $450 million worth of computing 
products over the past five years in support of Air Force programs. 
The departure of CEO Mark Hurd, who left earlier this month in the wake of questions about his personal 
conduct, has weighed heavily on H-P and dragged its stock price lower. Mr. Hurd was known for his cost-cutting 
and deal-making skills.

Page 132 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
H-P is the world's top computer maker by unit sales, but it has looked for new areas of growth. Those have 
included high-margin corporate services, an area Mr. Hurd was crucial in developing at H-P. Most computer 
makers have been grappling with choppy sales and compressed margins in recent months. 
Since Mr. Hurd's departure, H-P has continued looking for growth opportunities. It is embroiled in a bidding war 
for Fremont, Calif.-based 3Par Inc., which makes high-end storage software and hardware seen as integral to 
corporate cloud-computing services. 
H-P and rival Dell Inc. have gone back and forth in raising their bids for the company. H-P is now offering roughly 
$2 billion for 3Par. 
H-P shares were at $38.56 in 4 p.m. trading Monday. Its market value is about $87.4 billion.

Hewlett-Packard Co. said yesterday its board approved the buyback of an additional US$10-billion in shares, 
even as it finds itself involved in an bidding war over data storage company 3PAR Inc. HP is competing to acquire 
3PAR in an intense auction that started last week with rival Dell Inc. On Friday, HP raised its bid to purchase 
3PAR to about US$2-billion. At the same time, the world's top personal computer maker is casting about for a 
new chief executive. CEO Mark Hurd resigned from HP after an investigation found that he had falsified expense 
reports to conceal a "close personal relationship" with a female contractor. Interim CEO Cathie Lesjak said HP 
plans to repurchase at least US$3-billion worth of shares in the fiscal fourth quarter.

TECH VIEW: H-P's Newsworthy, But Dell Fits Better With 3Par 
TECH VIEW: H-P's Newsworthy, But Dell Fits Better With 3Par 
By Therese Poletti 
A DOW JONES COLUMN

(c) 2010 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 
Lately, Silicon Valley has been riveted with another story involving the ever-newsworthy Hewlett-Packard Co. 
(HPQ). 
But this time, instead of boardroom sniping, spying or CEO ousting, the company is involved in a serious merger 
tug-of-war with rival Dell Inc. (DELL) over a little-known cloud-computing company. 
The two computer rivals are at loggerheads as they keep one-upping each other in an effort to buy 3Par Inc. 
(PAR), a developer of high-end storage for cloud computing, each hoping to boost its data center offerings with 
3Par's products. 
In an interesting twist, it seems that the abrupt resignation earlier this month of H-P former Chief Executive Mark 
Hurd is also playing out in this bidding war. 
It appears that the absence of Hurd, once H-P's financial disciplinarian, has now emboldened H-P's board and 
some of its top executives to throw caution to the wind. H-P's latest offer was $30 a share, or $2 billion, for a 
company with just under $200 million in fiscal 2009 revenue. 
As 3Par's board of directors have mulled the company's fate, it has, of course, looked for the highest offer it can 
get for shareholders. So far it has embraced the higher bid from H-P. But if 3Par's management had its druthers, 
it might prefer to do a deal with Dell, even if it looks like Dell might be losing out on the deal. 
Dell, 3Par noted in a company blog, is looking to expand both its storage business and its profile in Silicon Valley. 
"The way I understand it, they [Dell] want to have a bigger presence here in the valley, which is about time," wrote 
3Par's director of social media, Marc Farley, who also used to work at Dell. "As much as it might seem in Round 
Rock, the technology world doesn't revolve around Texas and it's important to have a corporate and development 
facility here." 
Maybe if Dell was the victor, it would even leave 3Par, based in Fremont, Calif., pretty much alone, as Dell has 
mostly done with its last big storage deal, EqualLogic. H-P, on the other hand, appears to be having issues with 
some recent deals, namely Palm Inc., as a stream of important engineers and executives have left the company. 
One recent high-profile exit since H-P acquired Palm was Peter Skillman, Palm's vice president of design, who 
left earlier this month. That was after the blow when Matias Duarte, Palm's lead webOS designer, defected for 
Google Inc. (GOOG), to become the Android user experience director. 
Rob Enderle, principal analyst with the Enderle Group, believes the 3Par executives will have greater influence 
inside Dell rather than at H-P. 
But the bidding for 3Par is getting into nosebleed territory, and some on Wall Street are questioning the valuation 
with H-P's last offer of $30 a share. That hefty offer may further discount the possibility of Dell coming back with a 
counter. "We continue to find the valuation very rich," wrote Shaw Wu, an analyst with Kaufman Brothers. He also 
noted that 3Par is probably a better fit with Dell because there is less overlap in products, and "thus more 
autonomy and less likelihood of massive layoffs" at 3Par under Dell.

Page 135 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Dell remained quiet on Monday, perhaps with executives in a huddle counting the company's cash again to see if 
it can reasonably match H-P's last offer. On Friday, 3Par's board said it considered H-P's latest bid of $30 a share 
to be a "superior proposal" and that it had notified Dell of its intention to end their merger agreement. 
Even if Dell comes back with another counter offer--should it choose to stay in this cat-and-mouse game--H-P has 
a bit more financial heft to keep outbidding it. At the end of July, H-P had about $14.7 billion in cash and 
equivalents, compared with Dell's $13.1 billion. H-P, with almost two times the quarterly revenue of Dell, 
generated $2 billion more in cash flow from operations than Dell in the same period. 
On Monday, as if to show its confidence, H-P announced a plan to boost its current share buyback plan by $10 
billion. 
It looks like 3Par may end up in the hands of the suitor it didn't really want.

* HP board approves additional $10 bln in buybacks 
* Plans to repurchase at least $3 billion shares in Q4 
* Shares up 2.4 percent (Adds analysts comments, timing, byline) 
By Jennifer Saba 
NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co said on Monday its board approved the buyback of an 
additional $10 billion of shares to boost investor confidence as it finds itself involved in a bidding war for high-end 
data storage company 3PAR Inc . 
HP, the world's top personal computer maker, and Dell Inc are competing to acquire 3PAR in an intense auction 
that started last week. On Friday, HP raised its bid for 3PAR to approximately $2 billion [ID:nN29138050]. 
The company is also casting about for a chief executive to replace Mark Hurd, who resigned as CEO on Aug. 6 
after an internal investigation found he had falsified expense reports to conceal a "close personal relationship" 
with a female contractor. [ID:nN06147588] 
Analysts saw the announcement of the buyback as a message to investors that the company is stable and 
financially strong. 
"It's trying to demonstrate that it's on solid footing and not drifting without a leader," said Morningstar analyst 
Michael Holt. 
HP interim CEO Cathie Lesjak said in a statement that HP plans to repurchase at least $3 billion worth of shares 
in its fiscal fourth quarter, which began Aug. 1. 
Jeffrey Fidacaro, analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, said he was encouraged by the announcement and is 
nudging up his estimates on HP's earnings for the 2011 and 2012 fiscal years. 
He now sees 2011 earnings of $5.05 per share, a penny above his earlier forecast, and 2012 profit of $5.57 a 
share, two cents higher than before. 
HP bought back $2.6 billion of its shares in its fiscal third quarter as part of an $8 billion repurchase plan 
approved in November 2009. Under that authorization, HP had $4.9 billion remaining to buy back its stock as of 
the end of July. 
There is no time limit on either program. 
The company, in a statement, said that the additional $10 billion is part of an effort to manage the number of 
outstanding shares in existence. Programs like employee stock plans tend to increase the overall amount of stock 
in the market, and HP said the buyback would help counter that dilution. 
HP had $14.7 billion of cash and equivalents as July 31, and a current market capitalization of nearly $90 billion. 
Shares of HP were up 2.4 percent, at $38.92 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by

DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) will add $10 billion to a share-buyback program, a move that comes as it struggles 
through a turbulent month that has seen the resignation of its chief executive and a 17% slide in its share price. 
On Monday, Palo Alto, Calif.-based H-P said its board of directors had authorized an expansion of its existing $8 
billion plan, which was announced in November 2009. The move is designed to offset the impact of shares being 
issued to employees, the company said.

executive, said in a statement. The company plans to repurchase at least $3 billion worth of shares during its 
fiscal fourth quarter, which ends Oct. 31. 
The action comes as H-P deals with the aftermath of the unexpected resignation of Mark Hurd, the company's 
widely-praised former CEO, who left the company in the wake of questions about his personal conduct. The 
departure of Hurd, well known for his cost-cutting and deal-making skills, has weighed on H-P and dragged its 
stock price lower. 
H-P is the world's top computer maker but it has recently looked for new areas of growth. Those have included 
high-margin corporate services, an area Hurd was crucial in developing at H-P. Those moves have come as most 
computer makers grapple with choppy sales and compressed margins. 
Since Hurd's departure, H-P has continued looking for growth opportunities. It is currently embroiled in a 
high-stakes bidding war for Fremont, Calif.-based 3Par Inc. (PAR), which makes high-end storage software and 
hardware seen as integral to corporate cloud-computing services. H-P and rival Dell Inc. (DELL) have gone back 
and forth in raising their bids for the unprofitable company. H-P is now offering roughly $2 billion for 3Par. 
Investors reacted positively to the share-buyback plan. In early afternoon trading, H-P shares were up 2.5% at 
$38.94. 
H-P has roughly $4.9 billion left in its original share-buyback plan and repurchased $2.6 billion worth of its shares 
during the latest quarter. The company's market value is about $87.4 billion.

3Par: Storing Up Value

TECHNOLOGY WEEK 
3Par: Storing Up Value

Corporate tech customers are embracing cloud computing more enthusiastically than expected, which is partially 
what's driving the strong demand for advanced storage products, such as those sold by takeover target 3Par. 
We have been extolling the virtues of storage since the recession started, including the probability that 3Par 
(ticker: PAR) and other storage outfits would become coveted targets. (See related story on page 18). 
As of Friday, it still wasn't clear which computer giant would win the bidding war for 3Par -- Dell (DELL), which 
made the opening salvo, or Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), which countered despite the recent and messy departure of 
former chairman and CEO Mark Hurd. 
The 3Par board accepted a revised bid by Dell of $27 a share, or $1.7 billion, only to have that offer topped again 
by HP a couple of hours later. HP's latest offer of 30 a share, or $1.88 billion, is about a 200% premium to 9.65, 
which is the price 3Par's shares were trading at before Dell's initial bid of 18 a share, or $1.15 billion, on Aug. 16. 
Ken Male, founder of TheInfoPro, a consultancy that works with corporate IT professionals, thinks that the bidding 
could conceivably go as high as $2.5 billion. 
The reason Hewlett-Packard and Dell are in a bidding war for the storage darling is that there really is no other 
"industrial strength" storage takeover candidate that is comparable, Male says. 
Both Dell and HP aim to provide corporate customers with one-stop shopping as companies move their data 
centers to the so-called "private cloud" on the Internet. Both vendors rely heavily on reselling other companies' 
storage products, such as those from EMC (EMC) and Hitachi Data Systems, and have incomplete portfolios as a 
result. Dell and HP customers tell Male that they often go directly to the storage specialists, including NetApp 
(NTAP), to get what they need. 
A successful acquisition of 3Par, which uses "virtualization" technology to add flexibility and economy to storage 
systems, could go a long way toward filling that void, Male argues. "With the move to internal clouds, you have 
[computer] servers that have been virtualize and networking that has been integrated. Now, you need to organize 
a storage strategy that works with server virtualization," and 3Par would provide that, he says says. 
Earlier this year, Male and his cohorts singled out ArcSight (ARST), an information security outfit that works 
hand-in-glove with storage, as another strong takeover target. Last Thursday, there were published reports that 
ArcSight was in play. The Cupertino, Calif., Company's shares closed Friday at about $40, up 42% for the week. 
TheInfoPro is expected to release a study early this week showing that corporate spending on storage 
strengthened in 2010, with 41% of the buyers indicating that they will spend more this year than last. That should 
make storage outfits hotter than ever. 
A new CEO for Hewlett-Packard? The pending buyout by Intel (INTC) of McAfee (MFE) could create a candidate 
for the top job at HP. McAfee chief Dave DeWalt could soon be out of a job. DeWalt is an accomplished CEO and 
an EMC veteran, where he helped form the company's software group. His name is almost sure to come up in 
HP's search.

3PAR gives HP the green light in $2bn tech deal 
DOMINIC MIDGLEY

3PAR, the data-storage company at the centre of a multi-billion-dollar bid battle between PC giants 
Hewlett-Packard and Dell, yesterday welcomed an improved $30-a-share offer from HP as "superior". 
3PAR's board of directors "has determined that the unsolicited proposal by Hewlett-Packard Company constitutes 
a 'superior proposal'," the company said in a statement. 
"The 3PAR board of directors notified Dell of its intention to terminate the merger agreement with Dell," it added. 
HP's counterpunch came just three hours after Dell announced that 3PAR had accepted its bid of $27-ashare, 
which matched HP's previous offer. 
3PAR shares were up 24pc at $32.28 following the news, indicating that investors expect an even higher bid to 
emerge. The shares had mostly traded at around $10 this year, until Dell announced an $18-a-share bid earlier 
this month. 
On the face of it, HP is the more powerful contender, with revenues of $115bn (£74bn) compared with Dell's 
$53bn, and a more global sales force that could help 3PAR grow faster. HP's offer values the company at $2bn. 
But the computer giant is still without a permanent CEO following the controversial ousting of its chief executive 
Mark Hurd earlier this month after an investigation into his links with the former porn actress Jodie Fisher. 
"I only hope that HP does not overpay just to show that it can execute on its so-called strategy without a 
permanent CEO," said Professor N Venkat Venkatraman of Boston University School of Management. "I also 
hope that Dell is not acting desperate to rapidly build its capability for enterprise IT services in an uncertain 
economic environment." 
The latest bids cap an action-packed two-week battle for 3PAR, which focuses on "cloud computing" in which 
data is stored remotely. Dell first announced on August 16 it had reached an agreement to acquire 3PAR at 
$18-a-share. HP made a counter-bid of $24-a-share in cash, which Dell matched. HP then raised its bid to $27 
and Dell followed suit. 
Both Dell and HP are hoping the acquisition would offer near-exclusive control over the market of advanced 
highend data-storage solutions, a field in which 3PAR is the dominant player. 
3PAR's technology enables large companies and government bodies to shift to "cloud" storage platforms, giving 
them extra speed in accessing data and cutting storage costs by nearly 59pc, according to the company.

DONATELLI'S CLOSEUP - HP DATA KING WANTS 3PAR AND THE CEO JOB

DONATELLI'S CLOSEUP - HP DATA KING WANTS 3PAR AND THE CEO JOB

Hewlett-Packard's point man in the escalating battle to buy 3PAR is making his play to replace disgraced CEO 
Mark Hurd, a source told The Post. 
Executive Vice President David Donatelli came from rival EMC Corp. in 2009 after running EMC's largest division, 
storage, and is leading the charge to beat out Dell to win the Fremont, Calif., data-storage company. 
At the time he joined HP there was speculation he would be Hurd's eventual successor. 
Donatelli pulled the trigger yesterday on HP's sweetened $30 a share, or $2 billion, offer for 3PAR. It was 
responding to Dell, which had earlier in the day matched HP's $27 a share proposal. 
After 3PAR recommends the HP proposal, Dell will have three days to match the bid. 
Dell is in the driver's seat as it only has to match HP's offer to win 3PAR because it won an auction to acquire the 
business earlier this month. 
On Aug. 16, Dell reached an agreement to buy 3PAR for $18 a share, an 86.5 percent premium over its previous 
day's closing price. 
HP lost the auction in which it participated because it did not believe it needed to pay an 86 percent premium to 
win, a source close to the situation said. Now, HP sees 3PAR as a must-have asset and is going all out. 
"I think Donatelli recognizes that every move he makes is being scrutinized," a second source said. 
Technology analyst Robert Enderle told MarketWatch yesterday that it is unlikely Hurd would have engaged in 
this kind of bidding war - which has now reached a multiple of nine times 3PAR's revenue. 
Another person considered by insiders to be in the running for CEO is former Compaq Chief Michael Capellas. 
Months ago, Capellas resigned as CEO of KKR & Co.-owned First Data Corp, the credit-card processor. First 
Data is struggling to pay its debts. 
Donatelli, according to a former colleague commenting last year on the Wikibon blog, had hit EMC's glass ceiling. 
The blogger describes the EMC veteran as "a micro-manager with an insane focus on delivering features and 
functions on time, at spec, no excuses." 
He also said Donatelli "trashed" Hitachi's high-end storage devices for five years. HP only has low-end storage 
devices and depends on Hitachi and others for high-end storage. It may not need to anymore if it buys 3PAR. 
Both HP and Dell have the cash to keep raising bids for 3PAR without their shareholders' approval. Because they 
are using cash to buy 3PAR, no shareholder approval is needed. 
HP shares yesterday, on a day the market rose more than 1 percent, fell 22 cents to $38. Since the battle with 
Dell began, HP shares are off 4.6 percent. 
The HP board was split on forcing Hurd out and may soon have a very interesting decision to make on whether to 
promote an internal or external candidate.

Hewlett-Packard yesterday topped Dell's offer for data-storage firm 3Par for the third time in a week, offering $30 
a share in a bidding frenzy prompted by strategic ambitions that pushed the price well beyond ordinary valuations. 
The latest offer valued 3Par, which is unprofitable, at $2bn and reflected what one adviser called HP's "deeper 
pockets" and determination to keep its longtime rival from winning. 
The bid equates to 95 times 3Par's forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and 
about 8.5 times forecast sales. 
The latest proposal came hours after California-based 3Par had accepted a sweetened offer of $27 from Dell. 
matching HP's previous bid made on Thursday. 
Dell is 3Par's first choice and is only required to match what HP puts on the table. The initial deal struck with 
Texas-based Dell had been for $18 a share, and even that was an 87 per cent premium over 3Par's stock market 
value. 
The $2bn price for the data-storage company and the rapid-fire pace of the bidding stunned industry executives 
and appeared to give even Dell pause at last. The company had no immediate reaction yesterday to HP's last bid 
as it weighed whether to match it yet again. 
3Par shares jumped another 25 per cent in midday trading to $32.48 as speculators bet that the battle would 
continue. 
"Regardless of who ends up acquiring 3Par, we believe the winners are 3Par employees and shareholders as 
well as the bankers and lawyers involved," said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Kaufman Bros. 
While regarded as a successful innovator in the fast-growing market for sophisticated and energy- efficient gear 
that stores businesses' digital information outside traditional on-site computers, 3Par is losing money and 
reported sales of just $54m in the latest quarter. 
In announcing one of its earlier bids, HP has said there would be no short-term impact from an acquisition on its 
earnings. 
Both HP and Dell want to build on their storage offerings as more of their customers move to a cloud architecture 
requiring access to remote data hoards. HP is ahead of Dell as both race to become another IBM, offering 
services and a wide range of hardware and software that make it an effective "one-stop shop" for technology 
buyers overwhelmed by the process of assembling everything themselves. 
Both hope to make storage a bigger part of their suites and might be nervous about Cisco Systems' aspirations as 
well. Cisco has a joint venture with EMC, the leading, independent storage company. 
"Dell and HP should have some paranoia about Cisco's ability to take away some of their most coveted 
customers," said Ashok Kumar, an analyst from Rodman & Renshaw.

Dell Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s fight to buy a small data-storage company turned into a classic corporate 
battle as first Dell and then H-P ratcheted up their offers to acquire a technology that's part of a shift shaking up 
their industry. 
Early Thursday, Dell raised its all-cash bid for 3PAR Inc. to about $1.6 billion, or $24.30 a share. The price was 
slightly higher than a $24-a-share offer made by H-P on Monday, which sought to scuttle an earlier deal struck 
between Dell and 3PAR. 
Within hours, H-P came back with a revised bid for 3PAR of $27 a share, or about $1.8 billion. H-P's latest offer is 
nearly three times the price that 3PAR shares fetched two weeks ago, just before the takeover talks became 
public. 
The bitter computer rivals have raised the stakes for once-obscure 3PAR as they face pressure to rev up growth. 
Dell founder Michael Dell is looking to move his company beyond the low-margin personal computer business. 
H-P wants to demonstrate that its strategy hasn't been disrupted by the ouster of Mark Hurd as chief executive 
earlier this month. 
The pursuit of 3PAR is part of a struggle in Silicon Valley to dominate the emerging technology known as cloud 
computing, in which businesses store information in data centers operated by specialists and access that 
information over the Internet. Both H-P and Dell see cloud computing as a route to more growth as they build out 
their product portfolios in an effort to be one-stop technology providers. 
A person familiar with the matter said H-P is "in this to win it." H-P, which is sitting on a cash hoard of nearly $15 
billion, doesn't feel "any constraints," this person added. H-P expects Dell to respond to its new offer, and could 
decide to raise its bid yet again, the person said. 
Late Thursday, H-P executive vice president Dave Donatelli said H-P "remains uniquely positioned to execute on 
this combination." Meanwhile, Dell senior vice president Dave Johnson said the company, which has about $12.4 
billion in cash, is considering its next step. 
"We will take our time to assess the situation," he told The Wall Street Journal, adding that a deal with 3PAR "will 
be a winner for our shareholders." 
3PAR, whose board has twice endorsed deals with Dell, had no immediate comment. Shares of 3PAR, which 
were at $26.03 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange, jumped 6.7% to $27.78 in after hours trading 
following H-P's latest bid. 
The battle is also symptomatic of how the tech landscape has changed. In recent years, a handful of tech giants 
-- such as H-P, Dell, Cisco Systems Inc. and Oracle Corp. -- have sought to diversify their businesses by 
snapping up companies, bringing them increasingly into the turfs of rivals. 
The spending has been fast and furious this year. Last week, chip maker Intel Corp. agreed to acquire security 
company McAfee Inc. for $7.7 billion. 
H-P and Dell have a long history of dueling. For years they traded barbs as competitors in the PC market. Both 
have poached executives from one another. And more recently, H-P overtook Dell as the world's largest PC 
maker by units. 
With both companies now seeking to broaden their business, cloud computing has become a particular focus.

Page 147 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Market researcher IDC projects that spending on cloud-computing will increase to $55.5 billion in 2014 from $16.5 
billion in 2009 as businesses realize it's cheaper to outsource their data centers than build and manage them. 
The battle for 3PAR "shows that both H-P and Dell are desperate for growth and they are willing to pay for it," said 
Rob Cihra, an analyst at Caris &Co. "They both have gobs of cash. I don't think there is much real limit to what 
they can afford. It's tough to say where this ends." 
The original agreement between Dell and 3PAR gives Dell perpetual matching rights, or the ability to match any 
counter-offer within three days. As a result, Dell can match any H-P offer without having to raise its own offer by a 
large amount, a person familiar with the matter said. 
Under Dell and 3PAR's agreement, Dell also collects a termination fee of more than 4% of the total deal value if 
3PAR chooses to go with H-P -- an amount that will keep increasing as the per-share offer increases. 
H-P is making its move while contending with a vacant spot at its top after Mr. Hurd resigned Aug. 6 over 
business-conduct violations related to his relationship with a former marketing contractor. In the wake of Mr. 
Hurd's exit, H-P has sought to portray business as usual and bought a pair of small companies. H-P Thursday 
announced the acquisition of closely held software maker Stratavia Inc. 
Both Dell and H-P are offering large premiums for 3PAR, which traded for less than $10 a share before Dell's 
initial offer was announced Aug 16. Specifically, 3PAR, Fremont, Calif., makes a product that helps companies 
store and manage their data more efficiently. 
In less than three years as a public company, it has built up a roster of customers that includes financial-services 
firms, health care, and government organizations. 
Both Dell and H-P have storage products, but neither has ones that are customized for cloud computing like 
3PAR's. 
3PAR is "an up and coming star," said Bryan Lucas, executive director of technology resources at Texas Christian 
University, who has been using 3PAR's storage systems since 2008. "It makes sense that these big companies 
would want them." 
Mr. Lucas said the 3PAR system is easy to manage and the product stores data using only the minimum storage 
space necessary while competing systems tend to reserve large chunks of storage systems even when not all of 
that space is needed. 
Initially, there were four parties interested in 3PAR, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in 
which 3PAR explained how its deal with Dell came together. 
People familiar with the matter said the other suitors included Oracle and NetApp Inc., which dropped out early 
on, leaving H-P and Dell to duke it out. 
H-P first contacted 3PAR about a possible acquisition on July 8, and over the next week the two sides met 
several times. On July 14, David Scott, the former H-P executive who now runs 3PAR, met with then H-P chief, 
Mr. Hurd. 
H-P made an initial bid for 3PAR on July 23, according to the SEC filing. (The bid amount wasn't disclosed). A few 
days later, Dell offered $15 to $17 a share for 3PAR, but the two sides eventually agreed to enter into exclusive 
negotiations at $18 per share. 
At that point, 3PAR went back to H-P and said they would have to cough up more to continue talks. As of late 
July, H-P wasn't willing to match Dell's $18-a-share offer, according to the filing. 
On Aug. 1, 3PAR and Dell entered into two weeks of exclusive talks, which resulted in an agreement announced 
on Aug. 16. One week later, H-P reentered the fray with its $24-per-share bid.

Security software maker ArcSight Inc. put itself on the auction block and potential bidders, including Oracle Corp. 
and Hewlett-Packard Co., could pay up to $1.5 billion for the company, people familiar with the matter said. 
The Cupertino, Calif., company has been quietly shopping itself to a handful of big technology suppliers interested 
in its software, these people said. In addition to Oracle and H-P, EMC Corp, International Business Machines 
Corp. and CA Inc., are prospective bidders, they said. 
ArcSight makes software that detects unusual activity on corporate networks, such as an attempt by a hacker to 
break into a system. Its products are used by large businesses to help prevent cyber attacks and to spot potential 
policy violations. The company has more than 1,000 customers globally. 
ArcSight expects to fetch more than $40 a share and a deal could happen in the next couple of weeks, these 
people said. One person familiar with the matter said ArcSight hopes to strike a deal before its Sept. 2 quarterly 
earnings report. 
Its shares jumped nearly 30%, or $8.40, to $36.63 in 4 p.m. trading on the Nasdaq. As in any negotiation, the 
talks could fall apart at any time. 
ArcSight officials declined to comment, as did representatives for Oracle, H-P, EMC and IBM. A spokeswoman for 
CA wasn't immediately available. 
ArcSight went public in 2008. It had revenue of $181.4 million in the fiscal year ended April 30, up 33% from the 
year earlier. Income for the fiscal year was $28.4 million, up from $9.9 million a year earlier. 
A potential sale comes just days after chip giant Intel Corp agreed to buy McAfee Inc. for $7.7 billion. H-P, which 
is in the middle of a bidding war with Dell Inc. for storage company 3PAR Inc., recently bought privately held 
security maker Fortify Software Inc. for an undisclosed amount. 
Security software companies have been in demand lately, as large information-technology players scramble to 
offer a wider variety of products and services to help companies manage data more effectively and securely. 
As more corporate data is stored online, the fight against hackers and an ever-growing number of viruses has 
become even more intense, driving tech companies to snap up niche providers of security software. 
If H-P strikes a deal with ArcSight, it would be the company's fourth proposed acquisition since its chief executive, 
Mark Hurd, resigned on Aug. 6.

Hewlett-Packard Co. made a $1.6 billion offer for data-storage company 3PAR Inc., launching a bidding war with 
rival Dell Inc. as H-P tries to resume business as normal in the aftermath of Chief Executive Mark Hurd's surprise 
resignation earlier this month. 
H-P's $24-a-share bid is one-third higher than the $18-a-share that Dell agreed to pay for 3PAR last week. Both 
offers represent a big premium for the company. Before the Dell agreement was made public, 3PAR last traded at 
$9.65. 
On Monday, H-P called its bid "substantially superior" to Dell's and said it is poised to cinch a deal as soon as 
3PAR terminates its agreement with Dell. A 3PAR spokesman declined to comment. 
H-P also played down suggestions it was drawn into a public battle because of the distraction caused by Mr. 
Hurd's resignation, which took place on Aug. 6. 
"We are running the business as usual," said Dave Donatelli, H-P's executive vice president in charge of servers, 
storage and networking. 
Mr. Donatelli said H-P had been working on a deal for 3PAR for some time and that it had submitted a bid before 
the deal with Dell was announced. "Nothing has impacted our normal M&A process," he said. 
Still, people familiar with matter said Dell moved quickly with its $1.15 billion bid for 3PAR in part to take 
advantage of the turmoil at H-P caused by Mr. Hurd's departure. A spokesman for Dell said the company doesn't 
comment on M&A activity. 
Public bidding wars in the tech sector are rare, but not unknown. Last year, EMC Corp. and NetApp Inc. went 
back and forth several times for storage software maker Data Domain, which EMC eventually acquired. Data 
Domain, like 3PAR, is represented by Qatalyst Partners LLP, the boutique investment bank run by longtime 
industry insider Frank Quattrone. 
Dell and H-P, both of whose main market is selling personal computers, are looking to grab a bigger piece of 
corporate spending on data centers as information-technology budgets gradually come back. 
Founded in 1999, 3PAR builds high-end systems that help companies store and manage their data more 
efficiently, using what are known as virtualization technologies. It competes with products from EMC, Japan's 
Hitachi Ltd., as well as H-P and International Business Machines Corp. 
Philip Tasho, head of Tamro Capital Partners, a 3PAR shareholder, said the company's high-end storage 
products are crucial for any firm looking to participate in that segment of the market. 
"Dell and H-P don't have a solution at the high-end so, once 3PAR goes away, you'd have to start from scratch," 
Mr. Tasho said. 
Mr. Donatelli said acquiring 3PAR will give H-P access to products that are tailored for a fast growing part of the 
tech industry known as cloud computing. He said that H-P expects to sell 3PAR products to telecommunications 
carriers, commercial data-center operators and large businesses looking to improve their own computer centers.

H-P, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said if its offer is approved by 3PAR's board, the deal could close by the end of 
this year. 
3PAR, which went public in 2007, has about 650 employees and had $194 million in revenue for its fiscal year 
ended in March. The company, which is based in Fremont, Calif., had net losses for both its 2010 and 2009 fiscal 
years. 3PAR's chief executive, David Scott, is a former H-P storage executive. 
Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, bought storage company EqualLogic Inc. in 2007 for $1.4 billion. Last month, 
Dell agreed to buy another storage-technology company, the venture-capital-backed Ocarina Networks, for an 
undisclosed amount 
H-P's bid sent shares of 3PAR soaring 45% to $26.09 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading 
Monday. 
Dell stock declined 1.1% to $11.94 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while H-P shares slid 2% to $39.04 on the 
NYSE. 
A counteroffer from Dell is likely, said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies, which tracks the field. Dell 
and H-P each possesses a war chest that "dwarfs the deal as it stands," he said. Dell had $13.1 billion in cash 
and investments on its balance sheet as of July 30, while H-P had $14.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

NEW YORK -- Hewlett-Packard Co. is bidding $1.5 billion for data storage provider 3Par Inc., offering 33 percent 
more than what rival Dell Inc. agreed to pay for the company just a week earlier. 
The tussle for control of 3Par comes as both HP and Dell have been looking to expand beyond personal 
computers in search of bigger profits. 
The offer announced Monday raised questions about the direction HP is taking since CEO Mark Hurd was forced 
to resign earlier this month. Mr. Hurd was pushed out for filing inaccurate expense reports for his dinners and 
other outings with a former HP marketing contractor. 
Faced with questions about why HP made an offer for 3Par only after Dell jumped in last week with a bid for 
$1.13 billion, company executives declined to say exactly how long they had been considering the deal, or 
whether Mr. Hurd had been in favor of it. 
HP executive vice president Dave Donatelli indicated that HP had made a previous offer, but would go only as far 
as saying, "We've been working on this deal for some time." 
HP's bid of $24 per share represents a 33 percent increase over Dell's Aug. 16 offer of $18 per share, which itself 
had been 87 percent premium over the company's most recent closing price at the time. Including debt, HP 
valued the deal at about $1.6 billion. 
Dell spokesman David Frink declined to comment on the company's next move. 
HP, based in Palo Alto, Calif., is the world's biggest computer maker, with Dell, which is based in Round Rock, 
Texas, trailing at No. 2. But HP has gone further than Dell in stretching beyond the PC market. PC sales made up 
less than a third of HP's annual revenue of $116 billion during the most recent fiscal year, while they account for 
more than half of revenue at Dell. 
With the acquisition of 3Par, which is based in Fremont, Calif., HP would add to a data storage business that 
makes up about 13 percent of its revenue. 
The software 3Par offers is designed to maximize available space on data storage hardware -- a cost-cutting step 
-- by using a technique called "thin provisioning," by which extra capacity can be added as needed. 
HP executives cast the acquisition as adding to the one-stop- shop it is building for customers across a broad set 
of technologies, including data storage, network equipment and servers. The most recent deal in that effort was 
HP's $2.7 billion acquisition in April of 3Com Corp., which makes routers and switches that direct Internet and 
other data traffic. 
"Customers want to buy from fewer larger companies that they trust," Mr. Donatelli told analysts on a conference 
call.

Kildare Securities notes downgraded 
Kildare Securities’ Class C and D notes have been downgraded by Moody’s. 
The ratings agency said its downgrade of the notes, which are backed by loans from ICS Building Society, 
reflected its revised criteria for Irish residential mortgage-backed securities transactions, including higher market 
value decline assumptions due to expectations on Irish house-price declines. 
Fitch expects a peak-to-trough house-price decline in Ireland of 45 per cent. 
The agency affirmed the class A and class B notes with a stable outlook. 
Hewlett-Packard’s $1.6bn offer sparks bidding war for 3PAR’s $1.6bn offer sparks bidding war for 
Hewlett-Packard has sparked a bidding war for 3PAR with a $1.6 billion offer, topping rival Dell’s deal to buy the 
niche data storage company. The move to acquire nine-year-old 3PAR for about one-third more than the offer by 
Dell adds to a rush of mergers in the sector, with companies taking advantage of cash stockpiles and low stock 
market prices. 
Giant technology companies such as HP, Dell and IBM are encroaching increasingly into each others’ traditional 
markets as they expand into new areas. 
HP’s offer surprised analysts, who had speculated that the company would be thrown into disarray after chief 
executive officer Mark Hurd resigned this month. Its latest $24-a-share offer for 3PAR marks a 33 per cent 
premium to last week’s $18 per share bid by Dell, which the storage company’s board has approved. At the time, 
Dell’s bid was 87 per cent over 3PAR’s share price. 
Ulster Bank extends opening hours 
Ulster Bank is to extend its weekday opening hours by an hour. From Tuesday September 7th, the majority of its 
137 branches will open a half an hour earlier at 9.30am and close at 4.30pm, a half an hour later than the current 
4pm closing time. On Wednesdays, Ulster Bank branches will continue to open at 10am to facilitate staff training. 
Nine branches are excluded from the changes. These are Carrigallen, Swanlinbar, Delvin, Enfield, Rathangan, 
Kilcormac, Clara, Lifford and Kilkelly. They will continue to open from 10.00am to 4.00pm. 
Hernan appointed to Arnotts 
Arnotts has appointed a new chief operating officer, with former chief finance officer of Brown Thomas Ray 
Hernan stepping into the role. 
Prior to his appointment, Mr Hernan was director of finance overseeing both Selfridges and Brown Thomas 
department store chains in the UK and Ireland, respectively. Originally from Galway, he has also held the role of 
director of finance at Ryanair. 
Earlier this month, Anglo Irish Bank and Ulster Bank were cleared by the European Commission to take joint 
ownership of Arnotts as part of a major debt restructuring deal.

Suddenly, small storage vendor 3Par, which made 2 cents a share last quarter — one of its better showings — is 
a hot commodity. 
Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) on Monday made a surprise $1.6 billion bid to buy 3Par (PAR), one week after rival Dell 
(DELL) said it had reached an agreement with 3Par to acquire the maker of storage systems for $1.15 billion. 
And investors expect the fun isn't over. 3Par shares jumped 45% to 26.09 Monday, after HP announced its bid of 
$24 a share. On Aug. 16, 3Par shares jumped 87% to 18, on Dell's bid of $18 per share. Before that, the stock 
price had traded between a slim range of 8.65 and 11.85 since Jan. 13. 
Analysts indeed say a counterbid from Dell is possible. Dell reported cash and equivalents of $11.7 billion as of 
July 30. Dell didn't comment on HP's announcement. 
Fremont, Calif.-based 3Par reported sales of $194 million for its fiscal year ended March 31, which was a record 
but up just 5% from the previous year. 
HP's bid is a head-scratcher, says Robert Baird analyst Jayson Noland. 
3Par has "not been as successful as one might expect for such competing bids to emerge," Noland said. "We're 
not sure why HP is making this offer for 3Par." 
Some observers have said HP is simply trying to block Dell. But Noland says another possibility is that some 
executives at HP had been interested in 3Par for some time, but former CEO Mark Hurd was not. Hurd resigned 
Aug. 6 under pressure from HP's board. Directors, after reviewing a sexual harassment claim from former HP 
marketing contractor Jodie Fisher, had concluded Hurd had violated the company's standards of business 
conduct, though not its sexual harassment standards. 
Cathie Lesjak, HP's chief financial officer, is interim chief executive. 
HP sees 3Par advancing its cloud strategy, said a statement by Dave Donatelli, HP executive vice president of 
enterprise servers, storage and networking. And he said HP's higher bid offers "superior value to 3Par 
shareholders." 
Dell has other options besides getting into a 3Par bidding war with HP. Noland says Dell could instead set it 
sights on another storage vendor, such as Compellent Technologies (CML). Compellent's stock shot up 11.5% 
Monday, to a four-month high, on the 3Par news. Dell bought storage vendor EqualLogic for $1.4 billion in 2007. 
HP's storage business "has been a laggard," Noland said. 3Par CEO David Scott served as general manager of 
HP's storage business from 1991 to 2001. 
HP and Dell are both building their portfolio of products and services to serve the fast-growing trend of cloud 
computing, or Internet-based computing. 3Par's storage architecture is designed for cloud computing. With this 
approach, users access software and data via the Internet, or the "cloud."

Page 160 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
3Par's storage servers use virtualization software, used in cloud computing to provide tech managers with more 
flexibility. Workloads can be easily moved around, making it simpler to add or reduce capacity as needed. 
HP sees a way to grow its revenue by expanding 3Par's global sales reach, UBS analyst Maynard Um said in a 
research note Monday. He says tech mergers and acquisitions are heating up. (See story on A1.) 
"As highlighted by recent activity, we believe industry consolidation is well under way and would not be surprised 
to see more M&A activity from large IT hardware vendors," Um wrote. Besides storage, he says deals may focus 
on services and software for analytics and security. 
When Dell announced its bid for 3Par on Aug. 16, Dell said 3Par's storage platform could cut total data storage 
costs in half, storage administration costs by up to 90%, and storage infrastructure costs by up to 75%. 
3Par is "the leader in storage solutions for cloud environments," according to a research note from analyst Dinesh 
Moorjani of Gleacher &Co. Dell has said it will focus on business and other enterprise customers. Operating profit 
margins for Dell's core PC business are stuck in the low single-digits, notes Moorjani. He says that compares with 
high single-digits for servers and storage and double-digits for services. 
For its fiscal second quarter ended July 30, Dell said revenue from servers, storage and services rose 43% from 
the year-earlier quarter to $4.3 billion, where its overall revenue rose 22%. For its fiscal third quarter ended July 
31, HP said its storage and server sales rose 19%, while its overall revenue rose 11%.

The world's two largest computer manufacturers, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, are going head-to-head in a bid to 
buy 3PAR, a hitherto obscure provider of back-office data storage. 
HP yesterday slapped down a $1.6bn (pounds 1bn) offer for 3PAR, upsetting a $1.13bn takeover of the company 
announced by Dell last week, and fuelling a sense on Wall Street that deal-making is beginning to return after a 
long hiatus. 
The move by HP came despite a leadership vacuum at the top of the Silicon Valley company. HP lost its chief 
executive, Mark Hurd, this month in a scandal surrounding allegations of sexual harassment and personal 
expense irregularities. A permanent successor is yet to be chosen. 
Dave Donatelli, head of HP's servers, storage and networking business, urged 3PAR to accept the new offer: 
"HP's proposal offers superior value to 3PAR's shareholders. Our global reach, strong routes to market and 
commitment to innovation uniquely position HP as the ideal fit for 3PAR." 
In a conference call, he said HP's top-rank turnover made no difference to the bid: "I have absolutely no concerns 
as it relates to this deal." 
HP and its smaller rival, Dell, are both anxious to build their presence in so-called "cloud computing", whereby 
their client companies spend less on servers and software - choosing instead to receive technology over the 
internet according to need. Contracting out the storage of data on an adjustable basis is part of this trend. 
Based near San Francisco, 3PAR has 670 staff. Although the company made a loss of $3.2m last year, experts 
say it is in a growth area and could benefit from a surge in information technology spending when the business 
world finally establishes a sustained recovery from the recession. 
Shannon Cross, a technology analyst at Cross Research, said 3PAR made sense as a purchase for HP. 
"I don't think they are making an acquisition just to hurt Dell; this is a strategic asset," Cross said. "Storage is a 
focused area for HP as well as others, and 3PAR has a good product set." 
HP's bid for 3PAR is priced at $24 a share, while Dell's offer is for $18. Both the hardware makers have already 
done substantial deals to expand into services - Dell last year bought Perot Systems, founded by erstwhile 
presidential candidate Ross Perot, while HP spent $13.9bn on EDS in 2008. 
Mark Hurd's sudden exit from Hewlett-Packard has not stopped the hardware company taking 
on rival Dell

News analysis 
The battle for 3Par shows the sector's largest players were caught napping, says Joseph Menn 
The second move in about a year for a little-known data storage company highlights how big technology 
companies are scrambling to help their larger customers do more with the massive amounts of information they 
are collecting. 
Hewlett-Packard yesterday launched a bid for Silicon Valley company 3Par, which specialises in high-end data 
management gear that saves buyers money on power expenditures. In doing so, HP hopes to break up a $1.15bn 
offer from rival Dell. 
"3Par is probably the best high-end storage asset you can get right now," says analyst Amit Daryanani of RBC 
Capital. "This is the technology asset to go for." 
HP's $1.6bn offer is not only a third more cash but could be attractive on strategic grounds. Analysts pointed out 
the two companies are geographic neighbours and that HP has a larger sales force that could spread 3Par's 
wares further. 
With technology companies sitting on more cash than some groups in other industries, the sector's leaders have 
been able to pursue acquisitions throughout the downturn because they are less dependent on debt markets to 
fund purchases, bankers said. 
That has been most on display in data storage, where the buying spree has gone on for years. The intensifying 
competition in the segment came into broader view last summer, when in the trough of the recession top storage 
group EMC outbid rival NetApp and bought Data Domain. 
But the largest companies, including HP, Cisco Systems and IBM, are also keenly focused on capitalising on the 
boom in storage as companies move towards virtualisation and cloud services. 
As the computing framework inside big companies becomes larger and more sophisticated, data storage is being 
removed from hard drives to remote storage locations, leaving servers to perform more specialised processing. 
Also, customers want data to be easily accessible from multiple locations while being responsive to a greater 
number of analytical demands, providing an opportunity for makers of sophisticated gear and software. 
"Data storage has gotten increasingly more important and the big guys haven't kept up on the innovation side," 
says Jayson Noland, Baird analyst. 
Total data collection doubles every 18 months: telecommunications companies now collate information on every 
call, retailers track sales, and stock exchanges keep tabs on every trade.

Page 163 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The big computer sellers want to take advantage of that and add sales of storage solutions and analytical tools to 
the servers, PCs and networking equipment. 
The rapid growth in the sector has made even generous takeover offers pay off, analysts say. When Dell paid 10 
times revenue for EqualLogic in 2007, many said it had overpaid. But annual sales at the division have since 
soared to $800m from $140m and it looks like "Dell's deal of the century", Mr Noland says. 
Dell's success probably gave it the confidence to offer an 87 per cent premium for 3Par. But HP was already on 
high alert, because its storage offerings were a weak spot and recently departed chief executive Mark Hurd had 
set the company on a course of acquisitions in related areas. 
"We're very good at bringing in new technologies and growing them rapidly though the base," says Dave Donatelli, 
HP's storage, networking and services chief - himself a recent recruit from EMC. 
Financiers in Silicon Valley say HP has eyed other potential storage acquisitions. The biggest prize would be 
EMC but only a few companies could afford it. They include Cisco, IBM and, again, HP.

NEW YORK - Hewlett-Packard Co. offered US$1.6-billion for 3PAR Inc. yesterday, topping technology rival Dell 
Inc.' s deal to buy the data storage company and potentially sparking a bidding war. 
HP's move to acquire 3PAR for about one-third more than Dell's offer comes during a rush of mergers in the 
technology sector, with companies taking advantage of cash stockpiles and relatively low stock market prices. 
For its part, HP has been looking to expand into new businesses, with acquisitions of network device maker 
3Com Corp., tech services provider Electronic Data Systems LLC and mobile device company Palm Inc. It has 
become a giant, sprawling enterprise in the process, with more than 300,000 employees. 
"3PAR will further expand our strategic footprint in storage and diversify our offerings," Dave Donatelli, head of 
HP's enterprise server, storage and networking business, said on a conference call. 
HP's US$24-a-share offer for 3PAR marks a 33% premium to last week's bid by Dell, which the storage 
company's board has approved. At the time, Dell's bid marked an 87% premium to 3PAR's share price. 
HP said it was awaiting a response from 3PAR. A representative from Dell was not immediately available, and 
3PAR declined to comment. 
HP, faced with turmoil in its top ranks after the resignation of chief executive Mark Hurd, said it had been eyeing 
3PAR before Dell's public announcement last week. It said its board had approved the bid. 
"This has been a methodical process," Mr. Donatelli said. "We've given a superior offer, and we're confident in our 
business case and our proposal." 
Some analysts had speculated that the absence of a permanent CEO may deter HP from dealmaking, but Mr. 
Donatelli said it would not be a hindrance. 
Shares of 3PAR, which was founded in 1999 and posted revenue of US$194-million in its last fiscal year, jumped 
41.3% to US$25.49 after the HP announcement. HP stock was down 2.6% at US$38.80. 
The competing bids for 3PAR come as technology heavyweights like International Business Machines Corp. and 
Oracle Corp. are vying to become one-stop shops for all of their customers' technology needs, including security 
and storage. 
In particular, such vendors have been boosting investment in "cloud computing" technology, which enables users 
to access data and software over the Internet and corporate networks, allowing them to save space and costs. 
Some analysts said HP's offer was surprising because Dell had offered such a steep premium, but they also 
raised the possibility of counteroffers.

HEWLETT-PACKARD has trumped rival Dell's bid for data storage company 3PAR, despite dispensing with the 
services of its chief executive Mark Hurd a fortnight ago amid sexual harassment allegations. 
A week after Dell announced a recommended $1.15bn (£741m) bid for 3PAR, HP has made a $1.6bn counter 
offer. HP, which is being led by chief financial officer turned interim chief executive Cathie Lesjak following Mr 
Hurd's departure, said its bid is "substantially superior" to its rival's, and added that it is ready to seal a deal once 
3PAR's board rips up its takeover agreement with Dell. 
3PAR shares rose by $7.24 — 40pc — to $25.28, topping HP's $24-ashare offer, on hopes of a bidding war, with 
market insiders speculating that Dell may come back with a higher offer. But Shannon Cross, of Cross Research, 
said a third bidder may yet enter the fray. "I don't think they [HP] are making an acquisition just to hurt Dell," said 
Ms Cross. "This is a strategic asset. Storage is a focused area for HP as well as others and 3PAR has a good 
product set." 
The data storage company is attractive to both computer manufacturers as it will allow the victor to expand its 
"cloud computing" offerings, which involve providing remote storage in a virtual "cloud". 
For its part, HP said it had been considering making an approach to 3PAR before Dell bid. 
Dave Donatelli, head of HP's enterprise server and storage arm, said: "This has been a methodical process. 
"We've given a superior offer and we're confident in our business case and our proposal." 
HP makes its bid from a stronger position, with $14bn in cash on its balance sheet, compared with Dell's $11bn. 
However, Dell is likely to be hungrier, given its slide in the personal computer market rankings - now in third place 
behind HP and Acer, having once held the top spot. $1.6bn The amount HP has offered for 3PAR, beating 
Hewlett-Packard's offer of $1.15bn last week

Slideshow: Amazon's Case For Enterprise Cloud Computing(click for larger image and for full photo gallery) <!-- 
/KINDLE EXCLUDE --> 3PAR remains in the crosshairs of Hewlett-Packard, Dell, and at least one other 
undisclosed potential suitor as the players in the takeover of 3PAR study their next moves. 
On Monday, HP topped Dell's bid for 3PAR by more than 33%. Dell is studying the situation and, according to a 
single source cited by Bloomberg news service, Dell is preparing to trump HP's offer. 3PAR has said a third 
possible suitor had expressed interest in taking over the cloud computing storage company, but that company's 
identity hasn't been revealed. 
Dell started the bidding last week with a $1.15 billion offer for 3PAR; HP countered Monday with a $1.6 billion 
offer. 
With its cash hoard of nearly $15 billion, HP can continue bidding, if it wishes. At HP, the focus is on Dave 
Donatelli, general manager of HP's enterprise servers, storage, and networking unit. Because of a contract 
obligation set by his former employer, EMC, Donatelli had been restricted from working in storage until recent 
weeks. One of the industry's preeminent executive storage experts, Donatelli will likely play a decisive role in any 
decision by HP to continue running up bidding for 3PAR. 
In addition, Donatelli has suddenly been thrust into the limelight at HP, which is still reeling from the sudden 
departure of former chief executive Mark Hurd. Donatelli has said HP's evaluation of 3PAR began before Hurd 
left the firm. 
Dell, which also has a large pile of cash, may need 3PAR more than HP does. Known primarily for its PCs and 
laptops, Dell has been trying to muscle its way into IT services ever since it acquired Perot Systems for $3.9 
billion last year. A trophy like 3PAR would offer additional convincing evidence that it is becoming a major player 
in the IT enterprise world. Dell has said it wants to integrate 3PAR into its Dell/EMC product line.

Hewlett-Packard Co., the world's largest personal-computer maker, offered to buy 3Par Inc. for about $1.6 billion, 
topping Dell Inc.' s bid for the maker of data-centre equipment and software. 
The $24 a share cash bid is 33 per cent higher than Dell's off er, HP said Monday. Dell offered $18 a share in 
cash, or about $1.15 billion, for 3Par. 
HP and Dell are using acquisitions to challenge Cisco Systems Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. in 
the market for data-centre products and services, which generate higher profits than desktop and laptop 
computers. 3Par sells hardware and software that makes it easier and cheaper for companies to store 
information. Its stock rose past HP's off er, signalling that some investors expect a bidding contest. 
"One of the growth areas in technology is in the enterprise storage space," said Joel Levington, managing director 
of corporate credit at Brookfi eld Investment Management Inc. "3Par's products fit well in there. It's an easy way 
to gain product breadth." 
3Par's stock closed at $9.65 the last trading day before Dell's bid. HP fell 65 cents to $39.20. Dell lost 12 cents to 
$11.95 on the Nasdaq stock market. 
HP said it has been working on the proposed acquisition since before the departure of Mark Hurd, who stepped 
down as HP's CEO Aug. 6 after an investigation found he filed inaccurate expense reports to hide a personal 
relationship with a marketing contractor.

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Hewlett-Packard conference call. My name is 
Michael and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only 
mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. (Operator 
Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would not like to turn the 
presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Steve Fieler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please 
proceed. 
STEVE FIELER, VP OF IR, HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our 
conference call to discuss this morning's announcement relating to HP's proposal to acquire 3PAR. Joining me is 
Dave Donatelli, Executive Vice President and General Manager of HP's Enterprise Servers, Storage and 
Networking Business. After I give you a brief overview of the terms of the deal Dave will discuss the strategic 
benefits of the transaction. We will then conduct a brief Q&A session. 
This call is being webcast; a replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call. Some information 
provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are 
subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual future results may vary materially. Please refer to the 
risks described in HP's SEC reports including our most recent Form 10-Q. 
This presentation does not represent an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell any securities. HP's 
tender offer for 3PAR common stock has not yet commenced. At the time that the tender offer is commenced HP 
will file an offer to purchase -- and related materials with the SEC. Those materials, which will be available on the 
SEC's website, should be read carefully because they will contain important information including the terms and 
conditions of the offer. 
By now you have all seen our press release and letter to 3PAR proposing to acquire 3PAR for $24 per share in 
cash for an enterprise value of $1.6 billion. Our proposal clearly qualifies as a superior proposal to the Company's 
existing $18 per share agreement with Dell and we are very excited at the prospect of adding 3PAR and its highly 
scalable storage systems to our existing storage portfolio. 
HP delivered its letter in a definitive merger agreement to 3PAR earlier this morning and we stand ready to enter 
into that agreement immediately following 3PAR's termination of the Dell merger agreement. Importantly, our 
all-cash proposal is not subject to any financing contingency and has the full support of our Board of Directors. 
In order to consummate this transaction expeditiously we are prepared to commence a cash tender offer which 
will be conditioned upon 3PAR's Board approving our transaction and would reflect our higher price. We expect 
the transaction to close by the end of the calendar year. I'll now turn the call over to Dave. 
DAVE DONATELLI, EVP & GEN. MGR., ENTERPRISE SERVERS, STORAGE & NETWORKING, ENTERPRISE 
BUSINESS, HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. For a year now 
HP's Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking Business has been driving a single strategy called Converged 
Infrastructure. Converged Infrastructure brings together formally disparate technologies in servers, storage and 
networking into a unified solution that significantly reduces complexity in the data center and enables our 
customers to focus on innovating for their business instead of managing silos of technology. 
We have seen incredible customer enthusiasm and market momentum around converged infrastructure as 
evidenced by our earnings announced last week. We reported that our ESS business grew 19% year over year. 
This is proof that our customers have embraced Converged Infrastructure and the value that it's bringing to their 
IT environments. Today we announced our plan to further accelerate this strategy with our intent to acquire 3PAR. 
HP has an unmatched portfolio of intellectual property across storage, servers and networking solutions. 3PAR 
enables us to expand our storage offerings for enterprise class public and private cloud computing environments

Page 169 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
which is a key growth area for HP. 3PAR will further expand our strategic footprint in storage and diversify our 
offerings. HP and 3PAR's products are truly complementary. 
Now in addition to this outstanding technology fit it is important to note that HP has a unique ability to bring 3PAR 
storage solutions to the marketplace. Our sales and services teams have both the storage expertise and the 
global reach to drive growth for 3PAR's products. Our reach is something others simply can't match. We have the 
ability to sell these products through our channel partners, our direct sales force and our enterprise services 
division. 
Our Converged Infrastructure strategy today provides our customers with a broad array of solutions to meet their 
IT needs. The addition of 3PAR will serve to strengthen our product portfolio and accelerate our ability to provide 
the next generation of innovative data center and service provider solutions. 
Now as you know, HP has a solid track record of integrating and executing acquisitions as well as delivering 
organic growth. In terms of acquisitions 3Com, acquired in April of 2010, is performing above plan. Similarly, 
LeftHand Networks acquired in 2008, now known as our StorageWorks P4000 Series, delivered triple digit 
year-over-year revenue growth this past quarter. The P4000 is a unique storage solution that takes the complexity 
out of delivering shared virtualized storage. 
Now in terms of organic driven growth, the year-over-year revenue increase in our ProCurve networking business 
was 42% last quarter, and we just launched HP StoreOnce, our storage data de-duplication solution, which was 
built organically based on innovation from our HP labs. Data de-duplication is one of the fastest growing markets 
in storage today. HP StoreOnce is unique in that it's the only solution in the marketplace that can support 
client-side, in-line and primary storage de-duplication with a single architecture. It also delivers increased 
performance and a better price performance ratio than competitive offerings. 
HP's ESS and networking organizations have introduced a record number of new products in 2010 all developed 
internally, including our ProLiant G-6 and G-7 servers and blades which offer industry-leading performance, 
memory footprint and I/O scalability. These new servers deliver a payback in as little as 30 days. Our 
industry-standard server business grew 31% year over year in the quarter just reported. 
Announced in April the next-generation Superdome 2 high-end server for UNIX environments pioneered a new 
common server design that unifies server architecture from x86 to mission-critical systems. 
Our 10Gb Virtual Connect solution eliminates network sprawl with a single device that connects servers to any 
fibre channel, Ethernet and iSCSI network. Last quarter revenue growth in this business was greater than 60% 
year over year. 
HP's BladeSystem Matrix is the industry's first converged infrastructure management solution that enables 
non-disruptive provisioning of servers, storage, networking and applications from a single pane of glass. 
These and other products have been the foundation of our high growth performance in ESS and networking, 
underscoring the fundamental strength of our strategy, our focused execution and our strong competitive position. 
We are showing strong operating results and we expect 3PAR to add to our momentum. 
Moreover, we have done our work on this deal and know this company well. We have the highest respect for the 
management team and skilled employees, and 3PAR's culture of innovation closing mirrors ours. We intend to 
invest in the Company's technology, helping it to bring new capabilities to market at an even faster pace. We are 
confident in our ability to seamlessly execute and integrate this acquisition as we've done many times before with 
other companies. 
We believe this combination will accelerate HP's ability to deliver on our Converged Infrastructure strategy and 
increase value for our customers and shareholders. We are uniquely positioned to make this deal work and look 
forward to consummating this transaction quickly. Now with that I'd like to ask the operator to open up the line for 
your questions. 
OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Ben Reitzes, Barclays Capital. 
BEN REITZES, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Hey, Dave. Can you talk about what 3PAR would do to your a 
little more to your high-end offerings? I mean what this would do to your relationship with Hitachi and your overall 
high-end go to market? Then my second question just is, how determined are you to get this thing? I mean, if Dell 
comes back, etc., how are you going to deal with that scenario if other bidders come back?

Page 170 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
DAVE DONATELLI: Hey, Ben. Here's what I'll say. We view, as you heard me say, that you want to look at this 
deal in the total framework of what we're doing in the business. So Converged Infrastructure is our entire 
technology strategy; this fits into Converged Infrastructure by offering products not only just at the high end but 
also targeted at service providers which, as you know, is a pretty nice growth market that's available in the 
marketplace today. 
I think if you look at any storage business, and this would include ours, there's always some degree of product 
overlap. That's been expected, that's been around for years. I actually view that as a positive because what it 
makes sure is that you have a seamless offering and you don't have any competitive gaps. So again, I would look 
at this as a nice incremental offering. In terms of our offer, we think we have a superior offer here and we look 
forward to the response. 
STEVE FIELER: Okay, next question, please. 
BEN REITZES: Thanks. 
OPERATOR: Aaron Rakers, Stifel Nicolaus. 
AARON RAKERS, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Yes, I want to follow up on Ben's question a little bit. I believe 
in the past Dave, and I believe maybe even Cathie as well, when asked about the high-end storage market it was 
really brought up that it was really not a growth market in HP's eyes. So I'm trying to understand what changed 
here relative to a couple months ago in terms of the high-end strategy and also in that, is it fair to say that HP was 
not given an initial look here at 3PAR and therefore this is why we're seeing this counteroffer? 
DAVE DONATELLI: I'll start with your second part first. This has been part of an ongoing M&A process for us. As 
you know, we run a pretty disciplined process and we've been looking at this asset for a period of time. I think in 
terms of this product, it plays beyond just the high-end market -- so I understand your first two questions are 
focused solely on the high-end. This plays in the mid-tier and the high end and again also plays in incremental 
spaces, as I mentioned before, particularly in service provider and cloud-based storage. 
STEVE FIELER: Okay, thanks. Next question, please. 
OPERATOR: Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley. 
KATY HUBERTY, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Yes, thanks, good morning. I know there are a lot of moving 
parts as it relates to a bidding war, but at the current price and under your current assumptions around revenue 
and cost synergies when would this deal potentially become accretive? And then I have a quick follow-up? 
STEVE FIELER: Yes, I think as we said, we would expect this deal to close in calendar year 2010. And, Katy, we 
have not updated any fiscal fourth-quarter guidance that we gave on the last week's call. As relates to any future 
quarters, we'll be giving statement level guidance at our Street analyst meeting in a month here. But certainly 
given the deal size and our earnings power, we don't expect really any dilution that would be material really to 
3PAR for FY 2011 GAAP or non-GAAP. 
KATY HUBERTY: Okay. And then obviously there are a ton of investment opportunities; storage has been a clear 
focus for the Company over the past year. But at eight times next year's PE on HP shares, why isn't that the best 
investment out there right now? And did the work on this deal limit the Board from considering a bigger share 
buyback that might come once the resolution on this deal happens? 
STEVE FIELER: So, yes, we also talked about this last Thursday. We have a strong balance sheet and cash flow 
generation; this deal does not at all preclude us from being active in buying back our shares. I think as we stated 
last week, we've got $4.9 billion remaining in authorized share repurchase. We thought our share price was 
attractive in Q3; clearly our price is lower than that today and we would expect to continue to be active buyers in 
the marketplace. 
KATY HUBERTY: Okay, thank you. 
OPERATOR: Tony Sacconaghi, Sanford Bernstein. 
TONY SACCONAGHI, ANALYST, SANFORD BERNSTEIN: Yes, thank you and good morning. Dave, I guess 
one reaction from investors is that this deal feels highly reactionary. So, 3PAR has been trading at under $10 a 
share for a year; as you've talked about, you've had this convert strategy for a year. I guess the question was why 
wasn't this deal done earlier given that it seems to fit so well strategically? Did Mark Hurd not like this deal? And

Page 171 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
what, I guess, has changed over the last week and a half that really precipitated this, especially in light of the fact 
that LeftHand, from a scale-out perspective, is doing so well? 
DAVE DONATELLI: Yes, I started working in the storage business here at the start of this calendar year and 
during that time we've done a lot to the storage business. One, we brought in a lot of outside executive 
management talent which we think is critical to growing the business. We've also spent a lot of money in terms of 
organic development, as you saw with StoreOnce. And as I mentioned previously, we've been working on this 
deal for some time as well and it's been part of an active M&A process for us for some time. So, I view this as a 
very methodical approach to the marketplace in growing our offerings. 
TONY SACCONAGHI: Can you -- I just have one follow-up, or maybe two more follow-ups. First, given that 
you've been working on this deal for a while, was this deal brought to the Board prior to its being brought over the 
last few days? And second, Steve, you talked about the financial impact, will there not be a non-GAAP impact in 
2011 -- excuse me, a GAAP impact? 
STEVE FIELER: Yes, so I'll address that last one, Tony. As we look again, we'll be talking FY 2011 guidance at 
our Street analyst meeting where all -- impact of this or anything else will be factored into our FY 2011 guidance. 
And certainly from a materiality perspective, given our earnings power we do not expect any significant or 
material impact to FY 2011 GAAP or non-GAAP related to this. 
DAVE DONATELLI: In terms of your first question, all I'll say is we've been working on this deal prior to the public 
announcement you saw. 
STEVE FIELER: Okay, thanks. Let's move to the next question, please. 
OPERATOR: Keith Bachman, Bank of Montreal. 
KEITH BACHMAN, ANALYST, BANK OF MONTREAL: Yes, I have two as well. Dave, on the thought process 
surrounding the acquisition, HP has said over the last year, including since the beginning of the year, that it 
wanted to go after storage and try to commoditize the storage offerings. And 3PAR is a proprietary offering really 
targeted at the high end, although you indicated it was going to come down to the mid-range. 
So, how is this deal consistent with the thought of commoditizing storage, which iSCSI -- or the LeftHand 
acquisition was more of a software acquisition that in fact achieved that end? So I'm still confused on how this 
strategy of acquiring 3PAR is consistent with what HP said in the last year. And then I have a follow-up, please. 
DAVE DONATELLI: Okay, sure, let's start. I mean, if you look at what we've been saying for the last year, what 
we've been saying for the last year is converged infrastructure. So that's our strategy and, again, that strategy 
plays across servers, networks and storage. In addition to that, one of the great advantages we have at HP that 
you've heard us talk about for some time is both our scale in terms of go to market and our scale in terms of 
supply chain. 
So as we take on these assets we're able to plug them into a global selling machine that they haven't had before 
and you saw that similar with our 3Com networking deal, the success we've seen with that. And we can also then 
scale the business -- make great advantage in terms of the business cost by leveraging the scale of our supply 
chain. So I think this is entirely consistent with that. 
In addition, we're determined to play across the entire enterprise marketplace and we feel this product enables us 
to expand our reach into that market. And anytime we have growth opportunities like that we'll pursue them. 
KEITH BACHMAN: All right, well perhaps I'll go to my follow-up then. How are you measuring -- to say that this 
deal is not impactful, I get -- take that. But when you're spending six times sales, I'm just trying to understand how 
you might measure where the line is, so to speak, relative to what's a fair valuation for this asset. Because 
measuring on your cash income rate isn't necessarily I don't think the appropriate benchmark. So, how should 
investors think about how HP in response to the current situation, vis-a-vis Dell, how are you measuring what's a 
fair value? 
DAVE DONATELLI: Well, I think what we see -- again, I won't go into -- other than saying we have a superior 
offer out there today. What I will tell you is we have a very strong internal business case around this asset. We 
believe that this is an opportunity for us again to grow revenue and grow it at a very nice margin, which drives that 
business case. And then what I'd add to it is we think we're uniquely positioned and have built up a great track 
record of executing transactions of this nature.

Page 172 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
As we've already mentioned, if you look at 3Com, which was our networking acquisition we did in this same 
space, just since closing that in April we have over 300 proof-of-concepts already underway. And I think it's a 
great analogy for this transaction in that if you find a good technology, what a lot of these smaller independent 
companies have a problem of is that customers want to buy from fewer larger companies that they trust and that 
have global support for them. 
So again, looking at 3Com for a moment, very quickly after its acquisition we were able to get them into huge 
large accounts globally and that's by taking our scale and marrying that with our technology. From my perspective 
the 3PAR transaction is very similar. This is a company that has good technology but does not have the ability to 
bring it to market. We can bring it to market directly, we can bring it through our channel partners, we can bring it 
through our services group. And that gives us the ability to scale this asset quite rapidly. 
KEITH BACHMAN: Thank you. 
OPERATOR: Amit Daryanani, RBC Capital. 
AMIT DARYANANI, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL: Thanks. Good morning, guys. So it makes a lot of sense I guess 
buying 3PAR given the scale of architecture you get. Do you think it enables you to really push your converged 
architecture into cloud services, probably more specifically in a more aggressive way, along with the blade 
servers and EDS offerings? And how do you really see yourself along with PAR stack up with other enterprise 
system providers in the cloud market? 
DAVE DONATELLI: What I'd say today is even without 3PAR; today I think we have the best offering in enterprise 
period. And I don't say that just for the sake of saying that; I have a bunch of proof points around that. As you 
heard me say earlier on the call, we have refreshed our entire server product line-up from top to bottom; we are 
the industry leader in servers, we have the brand-new G-7 rack, mount and blade system servers out there today. 
On the networking side, you saw the growth that we're experiencing in networking, not only organic through 
ProCurve but what we've done with 3Com since its acquisition. So we believe that this asset is additive to our 
already very, very successful go to market and our very rich and deep IP portfolio. And it's only going to make us 
more attractive to those customers in the marketplace and only enhance our competitive position in the 
marketplace. 
AMIT DARYANANI: If I can just follow up -- I may have missed this, but did you talk about the Hitachi (inaudible) 
relationship? How much contribution do you get and how does that shake out if you do end up acquiring 3PAR? 
DAVE DONATELLI: Well, we would expect that relationship to continue. And as I mentioned before at the 
beginning is there's going to be overlap in storage solutions, that's been happening since the last 20 years in 
storage. So to some degree that's always out there, but I don't have any concerns about that. 
AMIT DARYANANI: Thanks a lot. 
OPERATOR: Bill Fearnley, Janney Montgomery Scott. 
BILL FEARNLEY, ANALYST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT: Yes, Dave. A quick question -- you said -- and 
then a quick follow. You say you've done the work on this deal, did that include prior discussions with the 3PAR 
management or 3PAR Board before the Dell deal was announced? 
DAVE DONATELLI: We have done due diligence on this deal prior to anything you've seen announced publicly. 
BILL FEARNLEY: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. How will the 3PAR senior management team fit into 
TSG? Will 3PAR be folded into the existing storage group or will you try to run it as an independent company? 
DAVE DONATELLI: I won't go that far to speculate exactly how we'd run it. But I will say this -- is that this is a 
company that's focused on R&D, they're located in our neighborhood, they're very close to where our corporate 
headquarters are. As a mentioned, we have had multiple meetings with their senior management and we feel 
they're an excellent fit for us. So I feel quite good about a very quick way to integrate and grow this business. 
BILL FEARNLEY: And then one quick one if I could slide one more in. Are you going to be trying to bring this stuff 
to the VARs more than 3PAR has in the past? Because our research suggests most of their sales are direct. 
DAVE DONATELLI: Well, again, what's great about as, and that was kind of the point I mentioned earlier, is that 
we have multiple channels to market. We obviously have our large partner network, we have our direct sales that 
specialize just in storage and we obviously have our services as well. So, we have many markets -- many

Page 173 of 177 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
channels to market with this technology that are not available to a smaller company or even to other larger 
companies. 
STEVE FIELER: Okay, Operator, we'll take two more questions. 
OPERATOR: Shannon Cross, Cross Research. 
SHANNON CROSS, ANALYST, CROSS RESEARCH: Thank you, I just have a couple of questions. The first is 
can you talk about customer overlap and sort of a sales strategy that, again it's early, but that you sort of foresee 
for this? And then I had a follow-up. 
DAVE DONATELLI: Well, if you mean customer overlap between 3PAR and Hewlett-Packard, I mean we have a 
$20 billion ESS business, so we're pretty much selling to everybody. What I view this is very complementary to 
our offerings is I'll mention just a reference back to 3Com, just as complementary as that was; it enables us to 
quickly ramp the business. And your second question was? 
SHANNON CROSS: My second question is just in the letter that Shane wrote today that was posted; it said we 
propose to increase our offer. So I was just curious -- it appears that you already had an outstanding offer to 
3PAR. And if that's the case I was just curious as to why you think they had taken Dell's prior and if this is just sort 
of a number or money issue and therefore a higher bid from HP will likely prevail? 
STEVE FIELER: I think as Dave described earlier, our offer at $24 a share here is a superior offer, we believe, 
and we look forward to Dell's response and 3PAR's response on it. 
SHANNON CROSS: But you're not going to tell us whether or not you actually had an offer to them before, I 
guess? 
STEVE FIELER: Yes, there was another offer on the table, that's right, that was in the letter. 
SHANNON CROSS: Okay, great. Thanks. 
OPERATOR: Richard Gardner, Citi. 
RICHARD GARDNER, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Okay, well thank you for taking the question. Dave, there have 
been a couple of questions in this regard on the call so far. But I was just hoping that you could -- you talked 
about how you think 3PAR plays in the mid-range as well. 
Could you just give us your thoughts on how you think the relative growth rates shake out between your current 
EVA solution and what 3PAR has to offer and how 3PAR might encroach on sales of your traditional EVA over 
time? And I know this is obviously a revenue synergy deal rather than a cost deal, but are there R&D savings 
associated with the deal or is it a situation where it's purely a revenue synergy situation? 
DAVE DONATELLI: Yes, I would not think of this deal as a cost-saving synergy at all. This is all about growing 
the business incrementally. I think also if you look, where 3PAR has optimized their product, it is in the mid-tier 
and high-end, not just the high-end. And they're classically focused on what I term the emerging server provider 
and cloud marketplace. 
So they have a lot of technology around, not to get too technical, but around things like multi-tenancy which 
enables shared storage, they have great tiering technology, things like that, that will enable us to go into markets 
that we are not participating in today. So again, I view this as getting us into markets where today we're not selling 
our product so that's why you keep hearing us say the word incremental. 
RICHARD GARDNER: If I could ask a quick follow-up to Keith's question. Would you be willing to give us a sense 
of what your hurdle rate typically is for these types of acquisitions? 
DAVE DONATELLI: No, we don't really disclose that internal information. 
RICHARD GARDNER: Okay. Well, thank you. 
STEVE FIELER: Okay, great. Everyone, thank you for participating in the call today. 
OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.

Shares of 3PAR (NYSE: PAR) have jumped 40+% today following news from this morning that Hewlett-Packard 
(NYSE: HPQ) has stepped into the ring with a $24/share bid for the storage systems-maker. Today's offer tops 
the $18/share bid that Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) made on August 16. 
Around the Street, analysts are mixed given the prospects of a "bidding war": 
Kaufman Bros. - the firm said that while it understands and appreciates the strategic rationale of HP's offer, the 
new bid still looks "a bit steep." Kaufman warns that the CEO transition will probably continue to weigh on the 
stock as "Mark Hurd won't be easy to replace." Maintains Buy and $51 price target. 
Janney - said it was not surprised by HP's offer and notes wording in the offer letter "'we propose to increase our 
offer to acquire all of 3PAR outstanding common stock to $24.00 per share in cash.' We believe this is a sign HP 
was likely outbid by DELL in the latest round. As a result of HP's offer, we believe a counteroffer by DELL is 
possible, however, we believe HP will prevail."Click here to track all the analyst action on shares of 3PAR

By Bill Rigby and Paritosh Bansal 
SEATTLE/NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Intel Corp's surprise $7.7 billion bid for McAfee Inc may trigger more 
deals as competitors scramble for a piece of the rapidly growing software security sector. 
Technology giants Oracle Corp , Hewlett-Packard Co , IBM Corp and EMC Corp -- which are all looking to 
expand the "stack" of hardware and software they offer corporate clients -- could move to counter Intel's 
emergence. 
That puts the spotlight on the world's biggest software security company, Symantec Corp , and a number of 
smaller companies such as Checkpoint Systems Inc , Sourcefire Inc , Websense Inc and SafeNet. 
"We're in the early stages of a major consolidation in software, particularly in security," said FBR Capital Markets 
analyst Daniel Ives. "This deal speaks to the convergence of hardware and software, which is becoming 
increasingly more important as the industry consolidates." 
The larger tech companies are all moving towards offering big-spending corporate clients an integrated range of 
products and services to help them manage networks and data. Security is now a critical part of that offering, 
making expert providers attractive targets. 
The push to diversify has triggered a wave of consolidation in the tech sector. Earlier this month, Dell Inc agreed 
to buy data storage company 3PAR Inc for $1.15 billion. Last month SAP AG bought Sybase for $5.8 billion and 
Hewlett-Packard bought smartphone-maker Palm for $1.2 billion. 
Symantec itself has been on the acquisition trail. In June, it bought PGP Corporation and GuardianEdge, two 
privately held companies focusing on email and data encryption, for an undisclosed sum. This month, it closed its 
deal to buy Verisign Inc's payment authentication unit for about $1.3 billion. 
Symantec shares jumped 6.2 percent on Thursday, giving it a market value of around $10 billion. 
Intel's deal for McAfee adds to what is turning into an unusually active August for M&A activity. Deals worth nearly 
$90 billion have been announced this week alone, making it the largest week since August of 2006, according to 
Thomson Reuters data. 
LIKELY ACQUIRERS 
Serial acquirer Oracle, the business software maker that branched out into hardware with its purchase of Sun 
Microsystems in January, may feel forced to match Intel's move.

"Oracle almost has all the pieces for an integrated stack, but is basically relying on somebody else to secure its 
offering," said Richard Williams, an analyst at Cross Research, who has a "buy" rating on Symantec. "That leads 
me to think that Oracle at some point will try and take out Symantec." 
Oracle, which has spent more than $42 billion to buy some 60 companies over the past seven years, declined 
comment. 
Hewlett-Packard, the world's biggest PC maker, is also a potential big acquirer in the sector. 
Only this week it bought Fortify Software, which sells compliance and anti-attack software to companies, for an 
undisclosed sum. Hewlett-Packard, which is looking for a chief executive after the acrimonious departure of Mark 
Hurd earlier this month, declined comment. 
IBM, which said in May it budgeted some $20 billion for mergers and acquisitions through 2015, could also be a 
buyer. It was not immediately available for comment. 
"I do think that these other companies will take a serious look at whether they need to do an acquisition or not," 
said Steve Sonne, an M&A partner at law firm O'Melveny & Myers. 
RICH PREMIUMS 
Microsoft Corp , the world's biggest software maker, can never be ruled out as an acquirer, but it already has a 
range of security products such as Forefront for business customers and Security Essentials for home users. It 
declined to comment on plans to acquire in the sector. 
Software deals draw price-to-earnings (PE) multiples in the high 20s to low 30s, said a source close to the 
McAfee deal. 
Intel paid a forward PE multiple of 18 to 19 times for McAfee, which was trading around 11 times PE after a 
couple of rough quarters, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized 
to talk to the media. 
At $48 per share, McAfee shareholders got a 60 percent premium to Wednesday's closing price. 
That follows a slew of other rich premiums in recent technology sector deals, such as the 56 percent premium 
that German software maker SAP paid for Sybase and an 87 percent premium that Dell is paying for 3PAR. 
Sellers are likely to seize on that number in the future. 
"Other sellers will try to use that as a benchmark to try to get a higher premium," Sonne said. "If somebody else 
gets offered a 20 percent premium, I am sure that the seller will say: 'But McAfee just got 60.'" (Additional
