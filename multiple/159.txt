Monsanto-Pharmacia Merger Does Not Sit Well with Wall Street 
Monsanto-Pharmacia Merger Does Not Sit Well with Wall Street

A proposed "merger of equals" between Monsanto Co. and Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc. prompted unequal 
drubbings of the two by Wall Street yesterday and set off speculation that Pharmacia might now attract hostile 
takeover offers. 
Holders of Monsanto shares were particularly eager to sell, knocking the St. Louis-based "life sciences" 
company's value down by more than 12 percent, or 5 1/8, to 36 5/8. 
But Pharmacia investors also decided not to wait around for the touted benefits of the deal, in which no premium 
would be paid to owners of either company. Its shares were off by 3 1/8, to 47 1/8, for a 6 percent drop. 
Combined, the two mid-sized drug companies saw their market values sheared of nearly $5 billion yesterday, the 
first day of trading after the late-Sunday deal to forge an entity with combined sales of $17 billion. 
Based on closing prices from Friday -- when rumors of the deal first hit the media -- the pair had a combined 
value of $52.6 billion. At yesterday's finish, that figure was down to $47.7 billion. 
"It's not a marriage made in heaven," said analyst Bob Kirby of Edward Jones. Investors were apparently hoping 
Monsanto would first jettison the agricultural chemicals leg of its drugs, nutritional products and farm-products 
business, he said. 
In detailing the merger, Monsanto said it plans to break off the agricultural unit as a separate company that will 
keep the Monsanto name but have its own board of directors. About 20 percent of its value will be sold in a public 
offering, and the newly created company --which has yet to be named -- will retain 80 percent ownership. 
Investors have endured months of disappointment over Monsanto's agricultural business, which makes 
gene-altered corn and soybean seeds as well as weed killer Roundup. Opposition, particularly in Europe, to 
genetically engineered crops and beef raised on gene-spliced antibiotics has been on a sharp rise in recent 
months, leading traders to knock Monsanto stock down 18 percent this year before announcement of the deal. 
"Pharmacia investors are probably a little unhappy that the company is taking on such potentially significant 
issues," said Jack Lamberton of Cape Bojador Capital Management. "Pharmacia had been a very tight, very 
well-understood story." 
The merged company would adopt Pharmacia's headquarters in Peapack-Gladstone as its own. Pharmacia 
chairman and chief executive Fred Hassan last year moved the company's global headquarters to New Jersey 
from London, bringing 600 jobs. The ag products unit will remain in St. Louis. 
With combined drug sales of nearly $10 billion and a research budget of $2 billion, the new company would be 
among the world's dozen-largest pharmaceutical concerns. Cost savings of $600 million are expected after three 
years. 
Pharmacia's lead products are treatments for glaucoma and incontinence, while Monsanto's champion is the 
arthritis pain reliever Celebrex, made by its G.D. Searle subsidiary and co-marketed with Pfizer Inc. After just 10 
months on the market, the drug has already eclipsed $1 billion in sales. 
Pfizer said yesterday that it will continue its "very successful" partnership with Searle, and added, "We have the 
highest regard for Fred Hassan." 
The statement was apparently meant to dispel speculation that Pfizer might turn predatory. William Steere, 
Pfizer's chairman, last month was quoted saying Pfizer would be interested in buying Searle "if Searle was 
available," but was not interested in buying all of Monsanto. He also said he would find it "pretty appealing" if 
Pfizer could be "100 percent owners of Celebrex."

Pharmacia, too, may now be on the radar screens of other potential acquirers as the drug industry continues its 
rapid consolidation, analysts said. 
"I believe another bidder will come in for Pharmacia as other companies take a longer look and see its value," 
said Brown Brothers Harriman analyst Mike Krensavage. But Lamberton said the company's stock price has been 
in the current range before without attracting suitors. 
Pfizer, best known for Viagra, the sex-enabler for impotent men, is tangling with American Home Products Corp. 
in a nasty battle for Warner-Lambert Co. 
Warner-Lambert and Pfizer comarket the fast-selling anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor, and Pfizer has said it intends 
to gain full control with a takeover of Warner. On the day that Warner-Lambert and American Home announced 
their $59 billion engagement last month, Pfizer stepped in with a hostile offer. 
Earlier this month, it was reported that American Home approached Pharmacia & Upjohn about a merger in the 
event that talks with Warner-Lambert fail. American Home and Pharmacia would not comment on the report. 
Monsanto proposed merging with American Home in 1998, but the deal fell apart over management issues.

Pharmaceutical mergers are back in vogue, write David Pilling and Adrian Michaels. 
The fact that Pharmacia &Upjohn has been mentioned in connection with not one but two possible merger 
partners in as many weeks says one important thing about today's drugs business. For once, the trite phrase that 
"everybody is talking to everybody" has some truth. 
The latest report pairs P&U with Monsanto, the St Louis-based life science business, after previous indications 
that P&U had been testing the waters with American Home Products. A separate rumour had linked Monsanto 
with Switzerland's Novartis, which ended up instead merging its agrochemicals business with AstraZeneca of the 
UK. 
The logic of pairing with Monsanto for P&U, whose business has been turned around since 1997, would be to 
consolidate its position in an industry where scale is becoming more important. 
If the deal went ahead, P&U would double its drugs business by virtue of Searle, the Monsanto pharmaceuticals 
arm that owns Celebrex, a $1bn anti-arthritis drug. But it would also be stuck with an agribusiness unit that Fred 
Hassan, P&U's chief executive, has shown no inclination to own. 
Any merger, therefore, would almost certainly involve the early sale or flotation of Monsanto's agribusiness 
assets. That may be a difficult deal to structure, though not impossible, say analysts. 
And whereas pharmaceutical companies were once able to cook up cosy no-premium mergers without fear of 
hostile intervention, Pfizer's aggressive move on Warner-Lambert has complicated matters. 
William Steere, Pfizer's uncompromising chief executive, has indicated he would like to get his hands on Searle if 
it became available, though Monsanto is not keen to spin off Searle on its own. 
Yet Monsanto may be finding that potential partners are frightened of stirring Pfizer's wrath. On the other hand, 
merger contenders might think now is the time to strike - while Mr Steere is distracted in a Delaware court with 
WarnerLambert. 
But why are mergers so much back on the agenda in an industry where consolidation has come in fitful bursts 
over the past decade? 
"It is the only way most drug companies can achieve the contradictory goals of boosting near-term investment in 
research and sales while continuing to deliver strong earnings growth," says Hemant Shah, an independent 
analyst. 
Drugs mergers are notoriously hard to pull off, but several factors are making them more feasible. One is 
succession. A number of companies, including AHP and Glaxo Wellcome, do not have heirs apparent. That 
makes Mr Hassan, credited with working wonders at P&U, a hot property, though $30bn seems a lot to pay for 
one man's talent. 
Another issue is talk in Washington about reforming Medicare by bringing drug pricing under closer government 
scrutiny. 
Steve Plag, analyst at CSFB, thinks talk of reform will fizzle out. Nonetheless, the mere spectre of price control, 
as in 1993, has spooked the industry and softened share prices. For some that might make the idea of merging 
more attractive.

Page 6 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Add to this mix the fact that several companies, including the most staunch go-it-aloners such as Eli-Lilly and 
Merck, are facing big patent expirations and it is easy to see why talk of consolidation is rife. Mr Plag says the 
period between 1995 and 1999 saw several mergers prompted by weakness as companies, particularly European 
ones, gained time through the cost-savings that consolidation brings. 
But Pfizer's unsolicited offer for Warner-Lambert could usher in a new phase, Mr Plag believes. Consolidation 
would now be driven, if not exactly by strength, then by a genuine conviction that scale has finally become a vital 
competitive advantage. Lex, Page 22 
P&U shares dip on Monsanto speculation 
Shares in Pharmacia &Upjohn, the US drug company, fell $1 3/4 to $51 1/2 in early New York trading yesterday, 
on speculation it might be considering a "merger of equals" with Monsanto, the life sciences group, write Nikki 
Tait in Chicago and Adrian Michaels in New York. 
Monsanto is at the forefront of the controversy over genetically modified crops but also has a pharmaceuticals 
division with some promising products. 
Monsanto shares rose $1 1/16 to $41 7/16, as analysts described the combination as a possibility but a "long 
shot". Both companies declined to comment. 
Analysts said a deal could be attractive for Monsanto, but it was less clear why Pharmacia would want to involve 
itself with the controversial agricultural seed and chemicals business, even if this was ultimately spun off. 
"There would be no synergies on the agricultural side, but both companies are looking to build their 
pharmaceuticals bus-inesses," said Bill Fiala at Edward Jones. 
He pointed out that the combined drug businesses would have more critical mass in a sector increasingly 
dominated by some very large companies. "It would go a long way to solving Monsanto's concerns but I still 
believe it's a long shot." 
Monsanto's problem is that it is fairly heavily indebted after an $8bn acquisition spree on seed companies. By 
combining with Pharmacia, it would get access to a stronger balance sheet.

Warner-Lambert yesterday said one of the reasons it decided to merge with American Home Products was 
because Pfizer had told its chairman it was eyeing a different acquisition. 
In a letter to its share-holders yesterday, Warner's board said William Steere, Pfizer chairman, told Warner 
chairman, Lodewijk de Vink, that "Pfizer was also pursuing another sizeable acquisition and might not be able to 
pursue both that acquisition and a Warner-Lambert transaction at the same time". 
Pfizer, which made an unsolicited bid for Warner just after the AHP deal was announced, is arguing in lawsuits it 
has filed that defence provisions in the AHP/Warner deal breach Warner directors' fiduciary duty to their 
shareholders. 
A number of possible combinations have been suggested by industry observers, including a tie-up with Searle, 
Monsanto's pharmaceuticals arm. Pfizer has indicated in the past that if Searle was for sale, it would be a 
potential acquirer. 
Warner says Pfizer's other interest added to uncertainty and confirmed its judgment that a deal with AHP, four 
months in the making, presented "an excellent value creation opportunity for Warner-Lambert shareholders". It 
says that until the AHP deal was announced, Pfizer had come up with "nothing specific, only a sales pitch". 
People close to Pfizer assert that Warner tried to block knowledge of its deal with AHP. Pfizer's bid is conditional 
on the outcome of its legal challenge to the defence provisions, which include cross-stock options and break-up 
fees. 
In its pitch to shareholders, Warner's board concluded: "We had to make a choice. Should we sign a deal with 
AHP that we believe is excellent for you ... or should we lose that deal to pursue the possibility that there might be 
a transaction with Pfizer, the terms and timing of which ... had never been known to us?"

MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., Dec.2 (Reuters) - The board of U.S. pharmaceutical giant Warner-Lambert Co. said on 
Thursday it was sending a letter to the company's shareholders backing the proposed merger with American 
Home Products Corp. 
The board said in the letter that it believed the proposed merger with American Home, challenged by court action 
and an unfriendly $77 billion takeover bid from rival Pfizer Inc., was in the best interest of shareholders. 
Defending itself against charges that it had ignored Pfizer's offers, Warner-Lambert's board said the merger deal 
with American Home allowed Warner-Lambert to talk with Pfizer, but that Pfizer had not presented any terms or 
timing for its proposed takeover of Warner-Lambert at the time Warner-Lambert chose to pursue its merger with 
American Home. 
Warner-Lambert agreed on Nov.4 to merge with American Home in a deal worth about $66 billion and Pfizer 
announced its bid several hours later. Pfizer has since started legal action to remove Warner-Lambert's board for 
breach of a standstill agreement between the two companies. 
In the letter, Warner-Lambert's board said it did not ignore Pfizer's first overture on Oct. 25, before the deal with 
American Home was agreed, but said that when asked, Pfizer "did not make any specific proposal, despite 
multiple opportunities to do so". 
It said that at the time Warner-Lambert signed its merger agreement with American Home on Nov. 4, the "terms 
and timing of (the Pfizer offer), and thus the benefits to you, had never been made known to us". 
The letter said that at the time of the overture, Pfizer chief executive William Steere indicated that he did not 
have specific terms in mind for a Warner-Lambert/Pfizer transaction, and that he had not discussed it with the 
Pfizer board. 
The letter also says that "Our merger agreement with AHP continues to permit us to consider third party 
proposals, including proposals from Pfizer, which do not rest on self-imposed conditions that cannot be met," but 
added that the proposed American Home merger "presents an excellent value creation opportunity for 
Warner-Lambert shareholders." 
The letter was also filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is to be posted on the company's 
Web site, www.warner-lambert.com.

Possible Warner-Lambert Suit Against Pfizer Could Backfire, Experts Say 
Possible Warner-Lambert Suit Against Pfizer Could Backfire, Experts Say 
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Robert Langreth, Gardiner Harris and Steven Lipin

Legal experts say Warner-Lambert Co. would be pursuing a risky strategy that could easily backfire should it 
decide today to sue Pfizer Inc. to scrap a lucrative joint marketing pact. 
Warner-Lambert, which has agreed to merge with American Home Products Corp., is trying to defend itself from 
Pfizer's hostile bid, now valued at $74.6 billion. At stake is control of the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, which 
will have sales of nearly $4 billion this year and is well on its way to becoming the top-selling drug in the world. 
American Home's offer is valued at $68.4 billion. 
While Warner-Lambert's board is scheduled to take up the issue of possible litigation over Lipitor at a regularly 
scheduled meeting today, the actual filing of a lawsuit could take another day, people familiar with the situation 
said. 
Despite reports of such a possibility, share prices of Pfizer and Warner-Lambert climbed. At the close of New 
York Stock Exchange trading at 4 p.m., shares of Pfizer climbed $1.25 to $35, while Warner-Lambert rose 
$1.6875 to $89.3125. American Home shares closed down 25 cents to $53.75. 
A Warner-Lambert lawsuit likely would allege that Pfizer breached the Lipitor marketing agreement by violating 
socalled standstill agreements in the comarketing deal, according to people close to the situation. These standstill 
provisions in general prohibit Pfizer from making a move for Warner-Lambert as long as the deal is in effect. 
Such a lawsuit would represent a bold attempt to hurt Pfizer -- and its share price -- by trying to take back control 
of the drug. But some attorneys and analysts said Warner-Lambert could jeopardize Lipitor's future growth 
prospects by challenging the until-now hugely successful collaboration. 
"They are playing with fire with the most valuable franchise in the global pharmaceutical industry," said Jeff 
Chaffkin, a PaineWebber analyst. "If they lose, they look very bad and they risk their key franchise. It's a very 
high-risk strategy which personally I'd prefer they not take." 
Warner-Lambert officials argue that Pfizer's overtures to Warner-Lambert -- starting with an Oct. 25 letter from 
Pfizer Chairman William Steere to Warner-Lambert Chairman Lodewijk J.R. de Vinkb -- reached the pact. 
"Pfizer's first letter violated the standstill agreement," said Anthony Wild, president of Warner-Lambert's 
pharmaceutical unit, in an interview. While no decision has been made, "you can safely assume a major portion of 
(today's) meeting" will be about this issue, Mr. Wild said. 
Six attorneys who specialize in corporate law, however, said Warner-Lambert doesn't appear to have a 
particularly strong legal case. Their reading of the Lipitor agreement is that Warner-Lambert would relinquish its 
rights to enforce the standstill agreement if a third company offered to acquire it, or if Warner-Lambert solicited 
such an offer. 
And the legal experts argued that this is most likely the case. Several months before Pfizer expressed interest in 
Warner-Lambert, Mr. de Vink initiated talks with American Home. By Oct. 25, when Mr. Steere sent his first 
letter, negotiations between Warner-Lambert and American Home were "in their final stages," Mr. de Vink said in 
an interview last week. 
John Coffee, a professor at Columbia University Law School, said he isn't familiar with the details of the American 
Home/Warner-Lambert negotiations but added that "in the normal course, after months of negotiations that are 
about to culminate, either there's an offer from one side or a solicitation from the other."

Page 10 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Even if Warner-Lambert were to win a legal battle for control of Lipitor, it might make Pfizer that much more 
determined to win the takeover battle. "As a tactical matter, you have to question why Warner-Lambert would 
bring a suit," said attorney Robert Kindler of the New York law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. "If they win, it 
forces Pfizer to go ahead with a takeover whether or not they could use (favorable) accounting or not. If they lose, 
it's an embarrassment." 
Some people close to Pfizer argue that a Warner-Lambert suit would amount to a scorched-earth tactic designed 
to drive down Pfizer's stock price. "We did nothing to violate the agreement," said one of these people. "There 
would not be merit legally or factually to the claim on the face of it." 
In Pfizer's lawsuit against Warner-Lambert, which claims Warner-Lambert directors breached their duty by not 
considering Pfizer's overtures, Pfizer alleges the standstill expired once Warner-Lambert reached an agreement 
with a third party. 
In the end, though, the highest offer will win the day, said attorney Reid Ashinoff, head of litigation at the law firm 
Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal. If Pfizer offers more money than American Home, the market will force 
Warner-Lambert to drop its enforcement of the standstill agreement, Mr. Ashinoff said. "The reality is that the 
marketplace sometimes drives legal positions. In other words, if they agree to a Pfizer transaction because the 
market wants that deal, Warner-Lambert can waive this provision."

Pfizer Files Suit Against Warner-Lambert, Alleges Contractual Breach

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- In the latest volley in the merger battle among three U.S. drug giants, Pfizer Inc. has 
filed a new complaint against Warner-Lambert Co. and American Home Products Corp. 
Pfizer (PFE), which co-markets the blockbuster cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor with Morris Plains, N.J.-based 
Warner-Lambert, alleges Warner-Lambert (WLA) breached contractual obligations to Pfizer. The complaint also 
alleges Madison, N.J.-based American Home (AHP) wrongfully interfered with Pfizer's contractual relationship 
with Warner-Lambert by inducing Warner-Lambert's breach. 
"The complaint seeks to enjoin the Warner-Lambert/American Home Products merger pact," Pfizer said. Pfizer 
also seeks to enjoin American Home from receiving any benefit as a result of its alleged wrongful interference and 
seeks to enforce Pfizer's contractual rights to make a superior merger proposal. 
Earlier this month, American Home and Warner-Lambert agreed to merge in a deal now valued at $68.4 billion. 
Pfizer then made an unsolicited, higher offer for Warner-Lambert, now valued at $74.6 billion. 
Pfizer's original offer, worth $82.4 billion, came on the the same day Warner-Lambert and American Home 
announced a $72 billion merger. 
Pfizer, citing public reports that Warner-Lambert entered into negotiations with American Home in July, said 
Warner-Lambert failed to disclose the negotiations to Pfizer and misrepresented them in response to inquiries 
from Pfizer's management. 
"Had Warner-Lambert not failed to inform and not mislead Pfizer regarding its negotiations with American Home 
Products, Pfizer would have known it was free from restrictions in the standstill agreement and would have made 
its superior proposal prior to the American Home Products/Warner-Lambert merger agreement," Pfizer said. 
Warner-Lambert late Tuesday responded saying the suit "consistently" misstates terms of the standstill 
agreement. Warner-Lambert claims the standstill ends only if it is being acquired by a third party and it reiterated 
that its agreement with American Home Products is for "a merger of equals," with no acquiring party. 
Warner-Lambert also disputed Pfizer's claim that the standstill agreement requires Pfizer be notified of 
discussions between Warner-Lambert and a potential other party to a business combination. Warner-Lambert 
said the standstill agreement is part of the joint marketing pact between the two companies concerning Lipitor. 
Warner-Lambert also said Pfizer is avoiding provisions of that agreement, noting "Pfizer recognizes there is a 
real issue about compliance with those agreements." Warner-Lambert added it is studying the Lipitor 
agreements and will consider actions that will best serve the interests of Warner-Lambert's shareholders. 
Lowell Weinger, a spokesman from American Home, said earlier Tuesday, "Although we haven't seen the 
complaint yet as described in Pfizer's press release, we believe this complaint is totally without merit." 
Pfizer made it clear that this latest lawsuit doesn't seek to change its lucrative, ongoing marketing arrangement 
with Warner-Lambert for Lipitor. 
"The Lipitor partnership is a very valuable asset for both companies and their respective shareholders. Neither 
party should take any action to harm that asset," said Pfizer Executive Vice President Lou Clemente. 
Market players have said Pfizer's wish to maintain profits from Lipitor sales is at the heart of its attempts to 
acquire Warner-Lambert. Pfizer Chairman and Chief Executive William Steere, who has acknowledged the 
drug's significance, has said its proposed combination with Warner-Lambert isn't just about Lipitor.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- In a move that continues the ongoing merger battle among three U.S. drug giants, 
Pfizer Inc. (PFE) filed a new complaint against Warner-Lambert Co. (WLA) and American Home Products Corp. 
(AHP). 
Pfizer, which co-markets the blockbuster drug Lipitor with Warner-Lambert, is alleging Warner-Lambert

party should take any action to harm that asset," said Pfizer Executive Vice President Lou Clemente. 
Market players have said Pfizer's wish to maintain profits from Lipitor sales is at the heart of its attempts to 
acquire Warner-Lambert. Pfizer Chairman and Chief Executive William Steere, who has acknowledged the 
drug's significance, has said its proposed combination with Warner-Lambert isn't just about Lipitor. 
What's new about Pfizer's latest complaint is the claim that Warner-Lambert breached the companies' standstill 
agreement related to Lipitor. 
The agreement restricted Pfizer from making a bid for Warner-Lambert, barring certain circumstances. The 
agreement has expired now that Warner has entered its deal with American Home. 
Pfizer is claiming that Warner-Lambert's failure to disclose its negotiations with American Home left Pfizer in the 
dark about the status of the standstill agreement. Pfizer maintains that had it known it was free from restrictions in

the agreement, it would have made its proposal prior to the deal agreed upon between American Home and 
Warner-Lambert. 
"What they're basically saying is that Warner-Lambert had knowledge of an offer and should have allowed them 
out of the standstill," said PaineWebber Inc. analyst Jeffrey Chaffkin. 
A matter for the court to decide will be whether or not Pfizer - according to language in the standstill pact and 
circumstances surrounding the American Home/Warner-Lambert negotiations - was free from its restrictions prior 
to the announcement of American Home and Warner-Lambert's merger deal. 
That Pfizer is suing Warner-Lambert over the standstill pact is an unusual turn of events in the ongoing battle 
between the companies, said Chaffkin. 
"This (pact) is really written to protect Warner-Lambert. It never originally crossed my mind that Pfizer would sue 
Warner over it," he said. "What happens here now is that Pfizer has essentially raised the bar one notch further - 
so I think this is far from over," Chaffkin added. Of primary concern to him is that the companies' spat will run the 
risk of disrupting the management of the multi-billion dollar Lipitor franchise. 
The next move in the continuing dispute could be made by Warner-Lambert. 
Chaffkin expects Warner-Lambert will likely come back and file a complaint that Pfizer breached the Lipitor pact. 
Warner-Lambert already alluded to this last week when it threatened to end its Lipitor pact with Pfizer on grounds 
that Pfizer might have breached the agreement with its bid. Warner-Lambert's board has a regularly scheduled 
meeting Tuesday, but so far current developments haven't changed the basic outlook of Banc of America 
Securities LLC analyst Leonard Yaffe. 
"We think the final bid for Warner-Lambert has yet to be made," he said, adding that he expects there to be an 
offer of $100 plus. 
Warner-Lambert's shares were recently trading at 88 9/16, down 3/4 or 0.8% on volume of 1.1 million. Average 
daily volume is 3.5 million. 
Pfizer's shares recently changed hands at 35 9/16, up 9/16, or 1.4% to 
9.5 million compared with average daily volume of 10 million.

Pfizer yesterday said it had filed official plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission to merge with 
Warner-Lambert and confirmed it would soon start trying to oust Warner's directors. 
The document spells out its case for winning control of Warner, thus scuppering its target's agreed merger with 
American Home Products. Pfizer's unsolicited $75bn bid came hours after Warner and AHP announced an 
agreed merger. 
Promised annual cost savings of $1.2bn from a Pfizer/Warner deal would come mainly from the "consolidation of 
over 100 manufacturing facilities", Pfizer said. Corporate headquarters would also be merged. 
William Steere, Pfizer chairman and chief executive officer, said the company would launch moves to remove 
Warner's board. By asking the courts to force Warner to hold a shareholders' meeting, Pfizer hopes Warner's 
shareholders will vote to replace the existing board with Pfizer candidates. They would then nullify defence 
agreements. 
At ascheduled analysts' meeting yesterday, John Niblack, head of R&D, said Pfizer expected to launch seven 
products by 2002 with combined peak sales of more than $5.6bn. As well as the Cox-2 inhibitor it is co-promoting 
with Searle, Pfizer said it had three other drugs with the potential to reach $1bn sales. These were Relpax for 
migraine, Zeldox for psychotic disorders and inhaled insulin. 
Pfizer was at pains to dismiss analysts' suggestions that its offer for Warner highlighted the relative weakness of 
its pipeline. Warner had suggested that Relpax, which some analysts regard as having only limited sales 
potential, was the best drug in Pfizer's pipeline. 
Pfizer said its offer for Warner remained conditional on it waiving a $2bn break-up fee and cross-stock options 
granted to AHP because those defences would prevent it using pooling-of-interests accounting. 
It said purchase accounting would entail over $80bn in goodwill. "Even if Pfizer is able to amortise this over the 
maximum possible period of 40 years, Pfizer will incur goodwill expense of about $2bn a year." 
Mr Steere said he had asked the courts to expedite its review of the Warner/ AHP plan and he expected that to be 
completed in four to six weeks. 
At lunchtime, Pfizer's shares were down 0.9 per cent to $34 11/16, Warner-Lambert was down 2.5 per cent to 
$90 9/16 and AHP down 3.1 per cent to $54 1/8.

Pfizer Attacks Warner-Lambert's Proposed Merger With American Home 
Pfizer Attacks Warner-Lambert's Proposed Merger With American Home

Pfizer Inc. lashed out at the proposed Warner-Lambert Co./American Home Products Corp. merger Tuesday, 
telling analysts that American Home is weak and stating in a court filing that Warner-Lambert brushed off its 
overtures to the detriment of shareholders. 
Pfizer also stepped up its takeover drive by filing with regulators for a possible proxy battle to oust 
Warner-Lambert's board of directors. 
In an interview, Warner-Lambert Chairman Lodewijk J.R. de Vink dismissed Pfizer's criticism and said he told 
Pfizer Chairman William Steere in their Oct. 27 meeting that he didn't want to do a deal with a much larger 
company. "I said, 'Bill, what you're proposing is not in our interest. We don't want to pursue it. We want to follow a 
different course with someone where we believe we have an equal voice,'" Mr. de Vink said. 
Moreover, Mr. de Vink said, he was concerned talks with Pfizer might prompt American Home to walk away from 
their negotiations, which had been going on for months. By giving American Home priority over Pfizer, he said, he 
wasn't shirking his duty to Warner-Lambert shareholders because American Home has a better new-drug 
pipeline. He added that he felt Mr. Steere was so vague about Pfizer's intentions that a real deal didn't seem to be 
on the table. 
Pfizer and Warner-Lambert have been tussling over this issue since Nov. 4, when Warner-Lambert and 
American Home announced a merger now valued at $69.99 billion and Pfizer launched its hostile offer for 
Warner-Lambert, now valued at $72.23 billion. Mr. de Vink has been criticized both by Pfizer and some 
shareholders for looking out for his personal interest over that of Warner-Lambert shareholders. Should Pfizer 
acquire Warner-Lambert, Mr. de Vink wouldn't likely end up as chief executive officer -- a post he would have in 
a deal with American Home. 
Before a packed audience of analysts, shareholders and reporters at its New York headquarters, Pfizer officials 
belittled the proposed Warner-Lambert/American Home combination and touted the prospects of a combined 
Pfizer/Warner. 
The presentation did little to bolster Pfizer's share price -- or that of Warner-Lambert and American Home. All 
three closed lower in a strong day on Wall Street, and the result was the gap between the competing bids 
narrowed to $2.3 billion, down from a more-than-$10 billion difference two weeks ago. 
Mr. Steere said he has no immediate plans to sweeten the offer, though investors and traders expect that to 
happen eventually. "At this point, we'd be bidding against ourselves," Mr. Steere said. 
Referring to Pfizer's lawsuit against Warner-Lambert to scuttle certain defensive provisions in its pact with 
American Home, he added, "We want to see how this plays out in court and then how it plays out in the market." 
He predicted a court fight could last four to six weeks. 
Pfizer officials said they have no immediate plans to use purchase accounting to buy Warner-Lambert outright, 
something they were mulling because the Warner-Lambert/American Home pact prohibits Pfizer from using 
favorable pooling-of-interest accounting. 
Pfizer fell 87.5 cents to $34.125 a share, while American Home declined 87.5 cents to $55. Warner-Lambert fell 
$1.875 to $90.875, suggesting investors are taking Mr. Steere at his word and expect the takeover tussle to drag 
on for some time.

Continuing to attack Warner-Lambert for brushing off its overtures, Pfizer claimed in a Delaware court filing that 
Anthony Wild, president of Warner-Lambert's pharmaceutical unit, misled Pfizer President Henry McKinnell on 
Nov. 2 when Mr. McKinnell inquired about rumors of a possible merger between Warner-Lambert and another 
company. According to Pfizer's filing, Mr. Wild responded that an announcement of a merger wouldn't happen for 
"several months." 
A Warner-Lambert spokeswoman said Mr. Wild recalls the question but says he didn't answer because the 
meeting was on a different topic. The spokeswoman added the conversation is "irrelevant" because 
Warner-Lambert already had indicated to Pfizer it was pursuing merger talks with another company. 
At the analysts' meeting, Pfizer officials contrasted its recent financial results and sales performance with those of 
American Home. 
With 21% revenue growth for the first nine months of 1999, Pfizer leads the industry, according to David 
Shedlarz, Pfizer's chief financial officer. Warner-Lambert is a close second, with 20%. "It's notable that one 
company -- all the way down here -- is actually experiencing no growth at all," said Mr. Shedlarz in a barbed 
reference to American Home. 
Pfizer compared the relative financial strengths of the two possible combinations, saying that in 
earnings-per-share growth over the next three years, Pfizer estimated its combination would grow 24% vs. 20% 
for American Home's. 
An American Home spokesman said he wouldn't respond to specific numerical comparisons but emphasized 
American Home is "very strong" and has "the strongest pipeline in the industry." 
The response from analysts and shareholders was muted. "It was a well-orchestrated presentation, but I don't 
think there were any surprises," said Linda Miller, portfolio manager for John Hancock Advisers' Global Health 
Sciences fund, who attended the meeting. 
Addressing investor concerns about whether Pfizer has enough potential blockbusters in its new-drug pipeline, 
Pfizer boasted it has six drugs in late-stage development that could reach the market by 2002 and that could each 
deliver $750 million or more in peak annual sales. The company plans to launch 27 new products by 2003, many 
of them expansions of existing drugs. 
Among other projects, Pfizer boasted it was developing a more potent successor to Viagra that it hopes will have 
fewer side effects; in particular, Pfizer hopes the drug would be less likely to alter color vision. 
One drug that has been delayed for more than a year due to worries about possible cardiac side effects is the 
company's antipsychotic medication, Zeldox. But Pfizer said it has recently completed a large study proving 
Zeldox's effect on heart rhythm is no worse than that of other drugs now on the market. The company plans to file 
for regulatory approval for Zeldox early next year. 
Mr. Steere, the Pfizer chairman, is a director of Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal.

Warner-Lambert raised the stakes in its attempt to fend off Pfizer's unsolicited $75bn offer yesterday when it 
announced it was considering ending its co-marketing agreement for Lipitor, the blockbuster anti-cholesterol drug. 
Warner-Lambert, whose agreed merger with fellow US pharmaceuticals company American Home Products has 
been thrown into doubt by Pfizer's move, said terminating the Lipitor agreements could enhance shareholder 
value. 
It said it was "reviewing Pfizer's actions and assessing the steps we should take in light of any breaches of the 
Lipitor agreements determined to have occurred". 
Lodewijk de Vink, Warner-Lambert chairman, yesterday wrote to William Steere, his counterpart at Pfizer, 
saying: "Pfizer is inappropriately using information about the Lipitor arrangements between Pfizer and 
Warner-Lambert, which is not available to Warner-Lambert's or Pfizer's shareholders." 
Mr de Vink said shareholders had the right to know the actual value of Lipitor to each company, and the potential 
gain to Warner-Lambert and loss to Pfizer if co-promotion was terminated. 
It has been widely reported that Pfizer and Warner-Lambert split Lipitor revenues according to each company's 
share of marketing expenses. It has also been suggested that Warner-Lambert has the option to cut Pfizer out of 
the deal in 2001 - a factor that may have prompted Pfizer's unsolicited bid. 
Yesterday's letter confirmed that Warner-Lambert had a right to reduce Pfizer's participation before the 
agreement ended. However, much of the success of Lipitor - set to overtake Losec, AstraZeneca's ulcer 
treatment, as the world's best-selling drug - has been achieved thanks to Pfizer's marketing muscle. 
Cutting Pfizer out could jeopardise sales growth, according to analysts who argue that AHP does not have the 
same marketing strength. 
Lipitor generates almost $4bn in annual revenues. 
At midday yesterday on Wall Street, Warner-Lambert's shares were down $15/16 at $92 3/4. Pfizer's remained 
at $35 1/8. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

Warner-Lambert yesterday raised the stakes in its attempt to fend off Pfizer's unsolicited $75bn offer, saying it

Cutting Pfizer out could jeopardise future sales growth, according to some analysts. Lipitor generates almost 
$4bn in annual revenues and some analysts believe this is likely to reach $10bn in a few years. Pfizer yesterday 
said it had not breached any Lipitor agreements. 
Pfizer had said its offer was conditional on Warner-Lambert waiving a $2bn break-up fee and cross stock options 
granted to AHP. 
The AHP/Warner-Lambert deals, if upheld in court, would prevent Pfizer from using pooling-of-interest merger 
accounting. 
Instead, Pfizer would have to use purchase accounting, which would oblige it to write off goodwill against profits. 
Pfizer has filed lawsuits challenging the fee and the options granted to AHP. 
It has also hinted it might be prepared to make its offer for Warner-Lambert unconditional, and so use the 
purchase accounting method. 
At the close yesterday on Wall Street, Warner-Lambert's shares were down Dollars at $92 3/4. Pfizer was $1/8 
lower at $35.

Pfizer CEO Sees Expedited Court Review Taking 4-6 Weeks

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- In an expected bid to win investor support for a merger with Warner-Lambert Co. 
(WLA), executives of drug giant Pfizer Inc. (PFE), addressing analysts at an annual meeting here, highlighted 
Pfizer's strengths as a stand-alone company and as a merged entity. 
From historical product-sales strength to projected earnings-and-revenue growth, Pfizer touted its achievements - 
and occasionally those of Warner-Lambert - while showing the weakness of American Home Products Corp. 
(AHP) through graphs and charts measuring drug sales and annual earnings-growth rates of the top 14 
companies in the pharmaceutical industry. 
"On all measures of financial performance, Pfizer/Warner-Lambert significantly outperforms Warner-Lambert 
with American Home," said Pfizer President and Chief Operating Officer Hank McKinnell. 
Pfizer Chairman and Chief Executive William Steere said he is "confident" about the company's ability to merge 
with Warner-Lambert using the favorable pooling-of-interest accounting method, an effort that will hinge largely 
on the outcome of a pending court battle between the two companies in Delaware. 
Pfizer earlier Tuesday said it has filed an amended complaint in a Delaware court against Warner-Lambert, its 
directors and American Home Products and will seek expedited discovery and an early hearing on its motion to 
enjoin the Warner-Lambert/AHP merger and Warner's "series of anti-shareholder defensive provisions" which 
include a $2 billion break-up fee and cross options that would prevent it from using pooling-of-interest accounting. 
Steere told analysts he expects an expedited review in court would take about four to six weeks. He also said, as 
did a Pfizer attorney, that Pfizer doesn't expect there to be any Federal Trade Commission issues regarding a 
merger with Warner-Lambert. 
"We plan not only to persist but to prevail," Steere told reporters in a brief question-and-answer session following 
the meeting. 
Pfizer's Steere said that if the company were forced, it would have to consider using the purchase accounting 
method in an acquisition of Warner-Lambert. 
Many on Wall Street believe the blockbuster cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor is at the heart of Pfizer's attempts to 
acquire Warner-Lambert, and Steere acknowledged the drug's significance. 
"There's so much at stake with Lipitor for both companies," said Steere. 
Still, Pfizer's McKinnell said the efforts to acquire Warner-Lambert extend beyond this top-selling drug the 
companies co-market. 
"The Pfizer/Warner-Lambert story is not only about Lipitor - it's really about opportunities for growth," he said. As 
reported earlier, Pfizer expects the combined company would have annual earnings per share growth of 24%. 
Terms of the Lipitor arrangements between the two companies, which remained confidential until 
Warner-Lambert Monday asked Pfizer to agree to public disclosure, are "very complicated" and consist of some 
40 agreements, McKinnell told reporters in the question and answer session following the meeting. 
Warner-Lambert said it sought to bring the terms public because Pfizer was "inappropriately using information 
about the Lipitor arrangements" unavailable to shareholders. Warner alleged Pfizer breached the co-marketing

Page 22 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
pact by making a bid for Warner, which Warner said allowed it to terminate to deal. Disclosure, Warner said, 
would give investors a chance to assess the true value of Lipitor to each company and the impact if Warner 
ended the agreement. 
Steere maintained Tuesday that Pfizer did not breach the agreement because it did not actually make an offer for 
Warner-Lambert. "There's no question we haven't breached," he said. 
McKinnell referred to the agreement as the best drug collaboration in history and expressed disbelief that 
Warner-Lambert would consider terminating it. 
"It would be pretty irrational, frankly, to end it," he said. "I just can't believe at this point they would do anything to 
harm their most valuable asset," he added. 
Currently, in the U.S., Pfizer is realizing 48% of Lipitor's incremental sales, McKinnell told reporters. World-wide, 
Pfizer is getting somewhere between 40% and 50% of sales, he said. Through the third quarter of this year, 
world-wide Lipitor sales have totaled $2.5 billion. 
McKinnell said there are only two ways for Warner-Lambert to terminate the 10-year Lipitor co-marketing 
agreement. One is if Pfizer breaches the contract, which it maintains it has not done. The other, McKinnell said, is 
an option under which Warner-Lambert can end Pfizer's role as a co-promotion partner, which means Pfizer's 
sales force and marketing efforts would be pulled out of use. That option is for April 2001, and would take effect in 
April 2002, McKinnell said. But Pfizer would still receive 75% of its contracted share of the profits. 
Pfizer - known for its aggressive sales and marketing team - is seen by many on Wall Street to have played a 
substantial role in the strong sales momentum of Lipitor. Responding to a question about what would happen to 
Lipitor if Pfizer's sales force is removed from marketing the drug, McKinnell said, "We don't know.... I suspect it 
wouldn't be good." 
Steere denied press reports that Pfizer would withdraw from attempting to acquire Warner-Lambert if Warner 
renegotiated the Lipitor pact with Pfizer. He said any role Warner-Lambert executives might play in a 
combination of the companies "would have to be negotiated." He did say that he thinks integration of the two 
companies would run smoothly, "with the exception of a few guys at the top." 
McKinnell said Pfizer thinks "highly" of Warner-Lambert management and said the two companies have similar 
cultures. 
Steere declined to answer a question about job cuts following a merger, saying Pfizer hasn't gotten to that point in 
the evaluation process. Regarding divestitures, he noted the pooling-of-interests method precludes any business 
divestments for two years. 
There has been speculation on the Street that Pfizer might up its bid for Warner-Lambert to draw a more 
enthusiastic response from investors. When asked about whether or not Pfizer would increase its bid, Steere 
said, "Well, at this point, we'd be bidding against ourselves. We want to see how this plays out in court, and how it 
plays out in the market." 
In an earlier statement Tuesday, Pfizer said that it intends to begin the process of soliciting consents to remove 
and replace Warner-Lambert's board so Warner-Lambert's shareholders can consider the most "advantageous" 
transaction available to them. 
In the meeting later with reporters, a Pfizer executive said that process has begun. 
Based on Monday's close, Pfizer's bid for Warner-Lambert was valued at $74.6 billion, while the proposed 
merger between Warner-Lambert and American Home Products was valued at $71.1 billion. 
In early afternoon trading Tuesday, shares of Pfizer were down 1/4 at 
34 3/4, while shares of 
Warner-Lambert were off 2 at 90 3/4 and American 
Home was down 1 3/4 at 54 1/8.

NEW YORK, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc.'s chief executive on Tuesday said he expected a four-to six-week 
legal battle as the giant drug company attempts to block a planned merger of Warner-Lambert Co. and American 
Home Products Corp. . 
William Steere also told reporters after a meeting with analysts that it was unclear what role Warner-Lambert's 
management might have if Pfizer succeeds in its $75 billion takeover bid for its smaller rival. 
"That would have to be negotiated," Steere said. "We're not at that point yet." 
Pfizer announced its bid for Warner-Lambert earlier this month only hours after Warner-Lambert said it had 
agreed to merge with fellow New Jersey drug company American Home Products. 
Pfizer and Warner-Lambert co-market Lipitor, a cholesterol-fighting drug that is expected to post global sales of 
$4 billion in 1999. 
Pfizer President Henry McKinnell told Reuters that Pfizer books "somewhere between 40 percent and 50 percent" 
of Lipitor global sales. 
In the United States, he said, "we're getting 48 percent" of incremental sales. Analysts said that under the 
co-marketing pact, Pfizer's share increases as overall sales rise, topping out at 48 percent. 
In a growing war of words, Warner-Lambert on Monday threatened to end its deal with Pfizer to jointly market 
Lipitor. 
McKinnell said the Lipitor deal was the most successful drug marketing partnership in history. "It would be pretty 
irrational to end it," he said. 
Referring to Warner-Lambert, he added, "I just can't believe they'd do anything to harm their most valuable 
asset." 
Seconds later, Steere stepped to microphone and told reporters, "But to follow up, we expect to have all of 
Lipitor." 
"We plan not only to persist but to prevail" in the battle to acquire Warner-Lambert, Steere said. 
McKinnell said Warner-Lambert, under the current Lipitor pact, has the option, exercisable by April 2002, to end 
Pfizer's involvement in co-promoting the drug. 
Under that scenario, he said, Pfizer would remove its Lipitor sales force and would lose a quarter of its current 40 
to 50 percent share of the drug's sales. ((-New York Health Desk, 212-859-1870)).

Pfizer Inc. will take the offensive this week and try to rebut Wall Street concerns that it launched a $75.3 billion 
hostile bid for Warner-Lambert Co. because it feared it couldn't generate enough growth without doing a deal. 
Pfizer is expected to tell analysts Tuesday at its New York headquarters that it has high hopes for an array of new 
drugs, future product introductions and earnings growth. The gathering will be Pfizer's most public pitch since it 
made its bid for Warner-Lambert Nov. 4, the same day Warner-Lambert and American Home Products Corp. 
announced their own $71.2 billion merger. 
The analysts' meeting had long been set for Nov. 22, but Pfizer moved it up a week when it became evident that 
traders and shareholders weren't roundly enthusiastic about its move on Warner-Lambert. Pfizer hopes that a 
successful presentation to analysts will boost its share price and generate support for its all-stock takeover 
attempt. People close to Pfizer say the company is expected to highlight the fact that seven of its products have in 
excess of $1 billion in annual sales. And seeking to reassure investors about the company's pipeline of drugs, 
Pfizer executives are expected to point to 10 products in late stages of development, which the company expects 
to be big sellers. 
Pfizer will make the case that its bid for Warner-Lambert was made simply because it was too good an 
opportunity to pass up, not because the company's fundamental business is weakening. To buttress that point, 
Pfizer is expected to reiterate that it expects at least 20% earnings growth this year and next, excluding the effect 
of a Warner-Lambert acquisition, a person close to the company said. 
In addition, as early as Monday, Pfizer will ask a Delaware judge to speed up its lawsuit aimed at scuttling a 
breakup fee and an unfavorable accounting-provision measure in the Warner-Lambert/American Home 
agreement, according to a Pfizer spokesman. 
On Friday, Pfizer released a letter from Chairman William Steere to Warner-Lambert Chairman Lodewijk J.R. de 
Vink in which Mr. Steere pointedly expressed his disappointment that Warner-Lambert's management and board 
hadn't seriously considered his overtures before they did their deal. Mr. Steere has said he made his intentions 
clear to Mr. de Vink in letters and in person but was essentially brushed off. 
"The fact that you and your board refused to give Pfizer the opportunity to make a superior proposal to a merger 
you were negotiating with American Home Products was, and continues to be, very troubling," Mr. Steere wrote. 
"I am always available to discuss this transaction with you." The letter was a response to one from Mr. de Vink 
earlier in the week in which he complained that Pfizer's unfriendly offer does "not comport with the way we believe 
partners should treat one another." Pfizer and Warner-Lambert jointly market a hugely successful 
cholesterol-reducing medicine called Lipitor. 
(Mr. Steere is a director of Dow Jones & Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal.) 
At the meeting today, "We are going to show you what Pfizer alone is going to do in the next two or three years" 
and how a combined Pfizer/Warner-Lambert would be even stronger, said Lou Clemente, a Pfizer executive vice 
president. Together, the two companies would form the largest drug company in the world. 
The continued rise in Warner-Lambert's stock price strongly suggests that Wall Street expects a significant 
increase in Pfizer's bid, according to takeover investors. Warner-Lambert's closing price Friday of $93.6875, up 
18.75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading, is nearly 6% higher than the current value of Pfizer's 
stock-swap bid. Pfizer closed at $35, down 37.5 cents, while American Home rose 43.75 cents to end the day at 
$55.9375.

Pfizer's rhetoric to analysts will be optimistic, but the fact is that the company has had some setbacks in the past 
year or so, including a decision earlier this year by federal regulators to severely restrict use of its antibiotic 
Trovan after it was linked to liver-toxicity deaths. Moreover, Pfizer faces the prospect of losing patent protection 
on several drugs in the middle of the next decade, and it is hard to spot potential blockbuster products in its 
near-term research pipeline. Also, prospects for its migraine drug Relpax are uncertain. 
But at the analysts' meeting, Pfizer will disclose plans to keep sales of its impotence drug Viagra humming and 
discuss prospects for a new pill that would combine Lipitor and Pfizer's blood-pressure drug Norvasc -- a 
combination that Pfizer believes could be a blockbuster seller. 
Researchers will also tout several drugs on the way, including a new inhaled form of insulin; a drug for urinary 
incontinence; and some promising early-stage cancer drugs. And research chief John Niblack is slated to outline 
synergies he expects from combining Warner-Lambert's scientific laboratories with Pfizer's. Among other things, 
Pfizer is optimistic about prospects for Warner-Lambert's experimental anticonvulsant, Pregabalin. 
Pfizer is also expected to explain to analysts why it took the unusual step of making a conditional bid for 
Warner-Lambert that hinges on being able to use favorable pooling-of-interest accounting. This has been a 
difficult issue for Pfizer because it has led some shareholders to question whether the company is serious about 
going through with a takeover. These concerns should be eased a bit after Pfizer asks the Delaware judge to 
expedite its suit. 
Mr. Clemente, the Pfizer executive, dismissed one Wall Street theory that the hostile bid was simply a tough 
negotiating ploy to protect or expand its Lipitor comarketing agreement with Warner-Lambert. "This is not just a 
shot across the bow to get a better deal on Lipitor," Mr. Clemente said. "It's more than an attempt to get all of 
Lipitor. We are now convinced that we should merge with Warner-Lambert." 
He played down concerns that Pfizer's takeover would lead to greater job cuts than if Warner-Lambert merges 
with American Home. Warner-Lambert and American Home have headquarters within a few miles of each other 
in New Jersey. 
"If you look at the history of us vs. that of American Home, it's ludicrous to think that we're going to slash and 
burn, but nice American Home is going to be fine," Mr. Clemente said. An American Home Products spokesman 
responded that its deal with Warner-Lambert is about growth, not about cost-cutting. 
Separately, in an interview Friday, Daniel Vasella, the chairman of Novartis AG, said the Swiss drug maker "won't 
go hostile on any company -- now. But you have to be quite opportunistic in these cases," he added. "One should 
keep a cool head, especially in agitated times." 
Several months ago, Novartis made an overture to American Home but was rebuffed, although some analysts 
speculate that it's still looking at the company. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Novartis is a 
serious suitor to buy all or part of Monsanto Co., although no deal is believed to be imminent. 
But Dr. Vasella refused to discuss specific companies in which Novartis might be interested. He reaffirmed, 
however, that the company is eager to become stronger in the U.S. "We'll do whatever we can with internal 
growth, but we don't exclude any options," he said.

Drug War Enters Spin Cycle; Latest Fight Over Lipitor 
Drug War Enters Spin Cycle; Latest Fight Over Lipitor

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The takeover tussle for Warner-Lambert Co. (WLA) may be headed for the Delaware 
courts, but for now, the battle is very much fought in the court of public opinion. 
For the past week, executives from Warner and American Home Products Corp. (AHP) have gone on the road to 
New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, selling shareholders on the merits of their proposed $71.2 billion 
merger. Pfizer Inc. (PFE) too has been arguing its case for its $75.3 billion unsolicited offer, with a public pitch 
anticipated Tuesday at an analyst meeting at Pfizer's New York headquarters. (Dollar figures for the proposed 
stock deals are based on Friday's closing share prices.) 
Besides amassing teams of bankers, lawyers, public relations advisers and proxy firms, the parties have begun 
staging a public battle for shareholder support - what Wall Streeters glibly call the "spin cycle" of a three-way 
takeover fight. 
The latest salvo - started coyly with a series of "Dear Bill" and "Dear Lodewijk" letters - centers on the agreement 
between Pfizer and Warner to co-market the Lipitor cholesterol reducer. 
Warner on Monday threatened to terminate the lucrative agreement - due for renegotiation in 2001 - on the 
grounds that the co-marketing pact might have been breached by Pfizer's bid. 
In a letter Warner Chairman Lodewijk de Vink sent to Pfizer Chairman William Steere, Warner cited concerns 
about "Pfizer's actions" and claims Pfizer "is inappropriately using information about the Lipitor arrangements" 
unavailable to shareholders. Warner has threatened to make public terms of the confidential pact so investors 
may assess the true value of Lipitor to each company and the impact if Warner terminates the agreement. 
But with 40% to 50% of the profits from Lipitor, which generates nearly $4 billion in annual revenue, Pfizer isn't 
expected to relent easily. On Monday, the company retaliated by vehemently denying any wrongdoing and called 
Warner's suggestion of contractual breach "inappropriate and wrong." 
With Lipitor at the heart of the takeover battle, market watchers say the terms of the co-marketing agreement 
could alter the battle lines drawn by the two camps. 
Disclosing the terms of the co-marketing agreement could hurt Pfizer in a number of ways. If Warner 
demonstrates a way to wriggle out of the co-marketing agreement, it doesn't have to share profits of a blockbuster 
drug. 
Pfizer has already drawn criticism for a lack of strength in its product pipeline, and Lipitor is seen as a crucial 
long-term growth driver for the company. "It has been the great unseen issue in Pfizer stock all along," said a 
Boston analyst whose firm has stock in both Warner and Pfizer. 
Showing how much Pfizer would stand to lose from the termination of the Lipitor pact would further endanger 
Pfizer's stock price and the value of its stock bid. All this could dissuade Warner shareholders from voting for the 
higher Pfizer offer. 
Also, making public the Lipitor terms will provide investors with the tools to assess the value of the co-marketing 
agreement to each company, the Warner-Lambert statement said. Under the deal, Pfizer was to provide Warner 
with a product of similar value in exchange for Lipitor, but the basis of what constitutes "similar value" isn't known, 
nor is the profit split between the companies, said the Boston analyst.

Page 28 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
On the other hand, there are those who say unveiling the terms of the Lipitor deal won't adversely affect Pfizer. 
"I don't think it matters," said HKS & Co. analyst Hemant Shah. Even if there is a loophole in the pact that allows 
Warner to terminate, Pfizer would end up wholly owning Lipitor if it pulls off the acquisition - which for now is still 
the financially superior offer. 
In a separate development that some see as helping Pfizer's cause, Aviron (AVIR) announced a delay in the filing 
for FluMist, an investigational flu vaccine co-developed with American Home, with the Food and Drug 
Administration. Even though it isn't expected to be a blockbuster, American Home has one less drug it can count 
on in its immediate pipeline. "Pfizer's position has strengthened (Monday) morning, I would think," said Brown 
Brothers Harriman analyst Michael Krensavage. 
Meanwhile, American Home has hired proxy solicitation firms MacKenzie Partners Inc. and D.F. King & Co. Inc. in 
preparation of a possible proxy fight. The company also is working with Sard Verbinnen & Co., a New York public 
relations firm, and is advised by Chase Manhattan Bank's (CMB) Chase Securities, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 
(MWD) and New York law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett (X.STB). 
Warner-Lambert has hired Georgeson Shareholder Communications, a New York proxy and corporate 
governance adviser, to a team including financial advisers Bear Stearns & Co. (BSC), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
(GS), legal adviser Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom, and New York public relations firm Kekst & Co. 
Pfizer is working with investment banks Lazard Freres & Co. (X.LZF) 
and Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER). The company is advised by Cadwalader 
Wickersham & Taft (X.CWT), a New York law firm, and its long-time public 
relations consultant Robinson Lehrer & Montgomery. The firm also has 
hired proxy solicitation firms Innisfree M&A Inc. and Morrow & Co. to 
find ways to take advantage of Warner's weak takeover defenses.

MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. -(Dow Jones)- The following is the text of a letter from Warner-Lambert Co. (WLA) 
Chairman Lodewijk J.R. de Vink to Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chairman William Steere regarding the companies' Lipitor 
agreement: 
Dear Bill: 
We continue to be concerned about Pfizer's actions. Among other things, Pfizer is inappropriately using 
information about the Lipitor arrangements between Pfizer and Warner-Lambert which is not available to 
Warner-Lambert's or Pfizer's shareholders. 
Given the significance of the Lipitor arrangements to both Pfizer and Warner-Lambert, it is essential that this 
information be made available to both sets of shareholders so that they may assess: 
- the actual value of Lipitor to each company over time under the arrangements as currently in effect; 
- the consequences of Warner-Lambert exercising its existing right to reduce Pfizer's participation prior to the 
end of the agreement; and, most importantly, 
- the gain to Warner-Lambert and loss to Pfizer if Warner-Lambert terminates such arrangements because of a 
breach by Pfizer. 
It is clear that Pfizer is both using to its own advantage and failing to disclose, to the detriment of 
Warner-Lambert's and Pfizer's shareholders, information about the Lipitor arrangements which is of unique 
importance to both sets of shareholders in assessing the current situation. 
As you know, the Lipitor agreements are the subject of a confidentiality agreement between Warner-Lambert and 
Pfizer. However, that agreement, assuming it is still in effect, should not be used to preclude shareholders or the 
investment community at large from access to this important information - especially when Pfizer's Board of 
Directors and management have the benefit of it in connection with making public offers for Warner-Lambert. 
Accordingly, I am writing on behalf of the Warner-Lambert Board of Directors to request Pfizer's immediate 
agreement that Warner-Lambert may publicly release the five basic agreements between Warner-Lambert and 
Pfizer relating to Lipitor, which, together, reflect the basic economic and commercial arrangement between our 
two companies. These agreements are: the Collaboration Agreement, the Option Agreement, the International 
Collaboration Agreement, the International Co-Promotion Agreement, and the International License Agreement, 
all dated June 28, 1996. 
This request is made without any waiver of any of Warner-Lambert's rights or claims under or relating to the 
Lipitor arrangements, including to make public these agreements under the terms of the confidentiality agreement 
applicable to them or because Pfizer has breached the Lipitor arrangements. 
As to the subject of breach, Warner-Lambert is reviewing Pfizer's actions and is assessing the steps it should 
take, including terminating the Lipitor agreements, in light of any breaches determined to have occurred as a 
result of such actions. Our Board of Directors feels we can do no less in view of Pfizer's actions and the 
significant value enhancement that could accrue to Warner-Lambert. 
I look forward to hearing back from you promptly. 
Sincerely,

Heard On The Street: Mergers Are Debatable Cure For What Ails Drug Firms 
Heard On The Street: Mergers Are Debatable Cure For What Ails Drug Firms

When Pfizer launched a $75.4 billion hostile-takeover bid for Warner-Lambert last week, it was made "out of 
strength," boasted Pfizer Chairman William Steere. "Most of the mergers we have seen," he added, "have been 
made out of weakness." 
Some folks on Wall Street think Mr. Steere is right -- on the second point. 
They argue that Pfizer's own bid for Warner-Lambert, an attempt to pre-empt a $70.6 billion offer from American 
Home Products, could be no different from other drug mergers in its aim: to solve weaknesses facing Pfizer's 
business. 
"Pfizer's move calls into question the long-term growth rate for Pfizer's revenue and earnings -- Pfizer is basically 
acquiring growth," says William Hackney, managing partner of Atlanta Capital Management, which owns about 
one million shares each of Pfizer and Warner-Lambert. 
"What you're seeing is Pfizer trying to get its ducks in a row for a more difficult environment that lies ahead," Mr. 
Hackney said. To address some of these concerns, Pfizer moved up the date of an analyst meeting to talk up its 
drugs in development. 
Investors, well aware that past mergers have been no panacea for drug companies, see the renewed urge to 
merge as a sign of weakness for the pharmaceutical sector. Pfizer had repeatedly insisted it didn't need to do a 
deal. 
But now, besides its hostile bid for Warner-Lambert, the New York concern has expressed an interest in buying 
Monsanto's Searle unit. Warner-Lambert owns Lipitor, a blockbuster cholesterol-reducing drug, and Monsanto 
owns Celebrex, the hot-selling arthritis drug. Pfizer has comarketing agreements for both drugs and would love to 
get total control of the many billions in cash these drugs are expected to spin out in the next few years. 
A Pfizer spokesman says a merger with Warner-Lambert would accelerate Pfizer's own earnings growth of 20% 
a year, since earnings growth at Warner-Lambert is expected to be 27% next year. Moreover, Pfizer says, the 
two companies' drugs are largely complementary, rather than competing, which should enhance growth. 
Other companies could have tougher going ahead. At industry titan Merck, four major drugs will lose patent 
protection over the next two years, and it doesn't appear to have many blockbusters emerging to replace them. 
"Let's face it," says David Alger, president and chief executive of Fred Alger Management, many of the drug 
companies have "weaknesses in their pipeline." Mr. Alger's funds have stakes in both Pfizer and 
Warner-Lambert. 
The dreary lesson from history is that, over the long run, drug-company mergers have been sickly performers in 
the stock market compared with drug stocks in general. Over the long term, the prognosis is especially bad. 
Mergers are often done to shore up weaknesses, such as a lack of sufficient drugs in the pipeline to replace 
current drugs that are going off patent. And that effort often falls short. 
To be sure, there is often a short-term pop in drug-company prices during a merger, as investors get excited 
about the combination's potential. The stocks of Roche Holding and Johnson & Johnson, both of which made 
acquisitions this year, have outpaced drug stocks in general. Many mergers, says Joseph Zammit-Lucia, chief 
executive of Cambridge Pharma Consultancy, "have been successful at plugging a short-term earnings gap." 
But too often, the benefits last about as long as a shot of NyQuil.

Drug companies typically merge "because they've got a problem," says Terrence W. Norchi, a physician who 
works as an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. "What the merger does is it buys them time, hopefully, to correct the 
problem," such as a looming product shortage, that spurred the merger in the first place. While cost cuts help in 
the short run, longer term "you have to be getting your act together in terms of the fundamentals of the 
organization." 
Alas, it is all too rare that a merger accomplishes much more than cutting costs short-term. "None of these major 
acquisitions has been followed by an increase of market share," says Samuel Isaly, whose OrbiMed Advisors 
manages $500 million, and who is a longtime follower of the drug industry. 
Look at some of the largest deals in the drug industry: Novartis was formed in 1996 when Sandoz merged with 
CibaGeigy, the second-largest completed deal in drug-industry history after this year's AstraZeneca. (The 
acquisition of Warner-Lambert would be larger on completion.) The stock of Sandoz (and subsequently Novartis) 
gained about 68% from just before the merger through Wednesday's close, according to Baseline. But that gain 
lagged far behind the 169% rise in the Dow Jones Pharmaceutical Index in that period. 
The stock of Glaxo Wellcome, formed when Glaxo Holdings bought Wellcome in 1995, has gained 192% since 
the end of 1994, shortly before the merger was announced. The pharmaceutical index in that period has gained 
more than 350%. The stocks of both Glaxo Wellcome and Novartis have even lagged behind the gains of the 
Standard & Poor's 500, which was outperformed by the drug-stock index. 
Even the 543% gain in the stock of Bristol-Myers Squibb since the end of June 1989, shortly before the 
Bristol-Myers combination with Squibb was proposed, has lagged behind the 664% gain in drug stocks in general. 
It seems tough even for good deals to work. Dr. Norchi, for instance, is a fan of Glaxo Wellcome. He believes the 
company actually improved its research effort after its 1995 combination -- a rare postmerger event. And until the 
end of 1998, the stock performed well. 
But this year, the company failed to deliver on its promise of double-digit earnings growth, and investors punished 
the stock. What is more, according to Dr. Norchi, the company tried to meet its shortterm earnings target by 
holding back on spending. "Unfortunately, they neither met their promise, nor built for future growth," Dr. Norchi 
says. 
There is an irony in some drug-company mergers. They are often done when a company lacks sufficient drugs in 
development -- but one popular place to cut costs is in research and development, says Jurgen Drews, a 
physician and the former president of Roche Global Research and now an associate of OrbiMed. 
"In most mergers and acquisitions, the emphasis is on short-term optimization," he wrote in a 1998 report. Not 
enough attention, he said, is paid to "the underlying issue of productivity which motivated the merger in the first 
place. Therefore, after relief which may last for a number of years, the old imbalance between research 
productivity and growth expectations may again become obvious and lead to a new round of mergers." 
There is another factor in the poor performance. Having heft is extremely helpful for drug companies -- but it hurts 
beyond a certain point. About 10% of a drug company's revenue is affected by patent expirations and gets eaten 
up by generic drugs each year, Mr. Isaly says. A drug company with a 10% market share -- about twice the size 
of the biggest drug companies today -- would "have to discover the largest product in the world every year to 
maintain" its market share, he says. 
But combining research organizations doesn't make it any more likely to find those blockbuster drugs. "If you 
have a 1-in-10 chance of success, and you combine the two, and you still have a 1-in-10 chance of success, you 
don't achieve anything; you just have to feed a bigger machine," says Dr. Zamnit-Lucia. 
After all, the success of new drugs involves a heavy dose of serendipity. It is nearly impossible to forecast the fate 
of a new drug. Even Lipitor, the cholesterol drug at the heart of the battle for Warner-Lambert, was a drug that 
few people thought would become such a runaway success, with sales this year approaching $4 billion. On the 
flip side, sales of Trovan, an antibiotic made by Pfizer that was supposed to be a hot seller, have been severely 
restricted after it was linked to several deaths from liver failure. 
Not surprisingly, big shareholders are in "show-me" mode. The record on drug deals is "mixed," says Brian 
Stansky, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price Associates, noting that companies can cut costs and get better 
distribution. "What we're all still waiting to see is how much combining the R&D organizations benefits or doesn't 
benefit. That's still an open question."

Pfizer Set To Discuss Pact Similar To Amer Home Products Deal 
Pfizer Set To Discuss Pact Similar To Amer Home Products Deal

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- In a letter to Warner-Lambert Co., (WLA), Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE) Chairman William 
Steere Jr. said Pfizer remains committed to a merger with Warner-Lambert and continues to believe a merger 
should be effected in the spirit of the two companies' many collaborations. 
To that end, Pfizer said in its letter, it is prepared to negotiate a merger similar to the friendly, $67.3 billion deal 
Warner-Lambert entered with American Home Products Corp. (AHP). Pfizer called its proposed merger offer 
"superior" to American Home's. 
Pfizer has offered to exchange 2.5 of its shares for each Warner-Lambert share in a hostile bid, but sued to 
remove a $2 billiion antitakover fee the latter would have to pay to American Home. 
Pfizer didn't specify whether it would now drop that provision in its offer. 
Steere said in the letter Friday that its merger offer wouldn't provide for a breakup fee and would let 
Warner-Lambert redeem its poison pill in the interest of shareholders. 
A Pfizer spokesman confirmed that the letter isn't an indication that Pfizer is prepared to drop the break-up fee 
requirement from the deal with Warner-Lambert. 
New York Stock Exchange-listed shares of Pfizer recently traded down 1/4, or 0.7%, at 35 1/8, on composite 
volume of 6.2 million shares. Average daily volume is 9.2 million shares. 
With 2.5 Pfizer shares set to be exchanged for each Warner-Lambert share, the proposed deal would value each 
Warner-Lambert share at 87 13/16. 
New York Stock Exchange-listed shares of Warner-Lambert recently traded down 3/16, or 0.2%, at 93 1/16, on 
composite volume of 2.1 million shares. Average daily volume is 3.4 million shares. 
New York Stock Exchange-listed shares of American Home Products recently traded down 7/16, or 0.8%, at 55 
1/16, on composite volume of 1.8 million shares. Average daily volume is 4.8 million shares. 
Pfizer said its agreement with Warner-Lambert will not have a pooling stock option, meaning Pfizer couldn't buy 
a percentage of Warner-Lambert shares upon termination of the agreement and which would make a pooling of 
interests transaction with another company impossible. 
A spokesman for Pfizer said American Home Products does have such an option in their proposed transaction. 
Pfizer said its agreement also provides a premium to Warner-Lambert shareholders, as compared with the 
American Home transaction. 
Pfizer added that its transaction will not contain an unreasonably long lock-up period. 
Pfizer's letter states that it is "in full agreement" with Warner-Lambert's letter of Nov. 9, in which it said the 
venture is "very important" to "both of us." 
Warner-Lambert's letter of Nov. 9 expressed disappointment over Pfizer's lawsuit and its effort to purchase 
Warner-Lambert.

Warner-Lambert said in the letter it hoped Pfizer would "commit to move this proceeding along as promptly as 
possible in order to resolve the uncertainty that Pfizer's litigation has created."

Pfizer yesterday said it might be prepared to make its $75bn offer for Warner Lambert unconditional in an effort 
to convince investors it was serious about taking over the company. 
"We want this transaction to happen. We think it is in our strategic interest and we will be pursuing all possible 
levers to push this thing forward." 
When Pfizer moved to break up the $68bn agreed merger between Warner and American Home Products last 
week, it said its offer was conditional on the company waiving a $2bn break-up fee and cross options granted to 
AHP. 
The purpose of these devices was to ward off an unsolicited bid, not only through the disincentive of an additional 
cost, but also by preventing an aggressor accounting for the deal on a "pooling of interests" basis. 
Instead, Pfizer would have to use purchase accounting, which would oblige it to write off goodwill against future 
profits. 
Pfizer yesterday confirmed it was considering whether to make its offer unconditional, though it said no move was 
imminent. Asked whether it might move to dismantle the Warner board through a proxy attack, it said it was 
examining all options. 
Pfizer also said it was not overly concerned by Warner's implied threat to withdraw from the highly successful 
co-promotion of Lipitor with Pfizer. "We think our interests are protected in the event of a termination," it said. 
Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering drug, is expected to sell $4bn this year. Pfizer said that, although the relationship 
with Warner was "strained", the co-promotion was continuing unaffected. 
Separately, Pfizer said it was negotiating with Searle, the drugs unit of Monsanto, to extend its co-promotion of 
Celebrex to Japan and other territories. 
Celebrex, a new type of anti-arthritic treatment that has racked up sales of $1bn in less than a year on the market, 
is co-promoted in the US by Pfizer and Searle. 
William Steere, the former's chairman and chief executive, said he was keen to gain control of Celebrex but said 
Monsanto was not a strategic fit with Pfizer.

Global Corporate Report: Pfizer Considers Unconditional Bid

Pfizer Inc. Chairman William Steere said the drug maker may drop the conditions it attached to its $74.6 billion 
(71.8 billion euros) hostile bid for Warner-Lambert Co., a move that could ease Wall Street's concerns and 
bolster Pfizer's chances of success. 
Separately, Mr. Steere said Pfizer wants to gain total control of the arthritis drug Celebrex, which it markets jointly 
with Monsanto Co.'s Searle pharmaceuticals unit. He said Pfizer is interested in acquiring Searle itself if it 
becomes available, as one way of obtaining Celebrex. However, he said, Pfizer has no interest in buying all of 
Monsanto. 
Pfizer's bid for Warner-Lambert now hinges on reversing antitakeover provisions in the friendly, $67.3 billion 
merger deal between Warner-Lambert and American Home Products Corp. Those provisions would force Pfizer 
to pay as much as $2 billion in a breakup fee, should its hostile bid prevail, and would prevent Pfizer from using 
more-favorable pooling-of-interest accounting treatment for the takeover. Last week, Pfizer sued to remove those 
provisions. 
But now, the company is considering whether to make its offer for Warner-Lambert unconditional, according to 
Mr. Steere and Pfizer President Henry McKinnell. "We are a long way from making that decision, but that is 
certainly part of the equation we are deliberating," Mr. Steere said in an interview. 
Wall Street hasn't known exactly what to make of Pfizer's conditional bid, which was announced Thursday. "What 
we're hearing is that the skepticism results from the fact that we made this offer conditional," said Mr. McKinnell. 
"If we lift those conditions, everybody would say it's a real offer." He added, however, that doing this would be 
"very painful" because it would force Pfizer into less desirable, purchase-accounting treatment that would reduce 
reported earnings per share. 
There are two ways for Pfizer to proceed on a hostile basis. One way is to take advantage of Warner-Lambert's 
weak takeover defenses by launching a proxy fight to oust the board. The other is an offer to shareholders in the 
form of an exchange offer of Pfizer shares. "The simplest way would be to launch the exchange offer," Mr. 
McKinnell said. 
Mr. Steere said Pfizer has been talking to Monsanto about expanding its interest in Celebrex, which is well on its 
way to becoming a blockbuster since being launched early this year. Celebrex is on track for sales of about $1.4 
billion this year. 
"If there is any way we could be 100% owners of Celebrex, that is pretty appealing," Mr. Steere said. One way to 
achieve that would be by gobbling up Searle. "If Searle was available, we would certainly look at it," Mr. Steere 
said. "But we are not looking at Monsanto." 
A Monsanto spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr. Steere's remarks. Monsanto has been in early-stage 
talks with several companies, including Pfizer, about a full or partial sale of the company; Novartis AG has 
emerged as a serious suitor. Bankers say Searle alone could be worth $25 billion to $27 billion -- much of the 
value of the entire Monsanto. 
Wall Street moved in Pfizer's favor Tuesday, widening the gap between the two deals. Shares of 
Warner-Lambert jumped 2.8%, or $2.50, to $90.375, while Pfizer's stock edged up 12.5 cents to $35. Meanwhile,

American Home slid 2.3%, or $1.25 to $52.875. In late New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, 
Warner-Lambert was up to $91.6875, Pfizer had slipped to $34.9375 and American Home was up to $54.4375. 
Mr. Steere also responded to statements by Warner-Lambert Chairman Lodewijk J.R. de Vink that Mr. Steere 
was vague in his overtures to him before Warner-Lambert and American Home announced their merger pact. 
Mr. Steere said he was prohibited from making a specific offer, or naming a price, by a so-called standstill 
agreement in a pact between Pfizer and Warner-Lambert to jointly market the cholesterol-reducing drug Lipitor. 
"I didn't make an offer. We couldn't make an offer unless they lifted the standstill agreement," Mr. Steere said. He 
added that Mr. de Vink refused to let Pfizer out of the standstill agreement so it could make a firm offer for 
Warner-Lambert. Pfizer argues that the standstill agreement was effectively lifted once Warner-Lambert signed 
its pact with American Home. 
Mr. Steere said that during his conversations with Mr. de Vink on Oct. 27 and 28, the Warner-Lambert chairman 
left the impression that he wasn't about to do a deal with anyone else. Mr. Steere said he was very surprised to 
learn on Wednesday of last week that a Warner-Lambert/American Home deal was almost done. 
Mr. Steere is a director of Dow Jones & Co., publisher of this newspaper. 
On Tuesday, Mr. de Vink sent a letter to Pfizer board members saying Pfizer's hostile bid and its lawsuit "do not 
comport with the way we believe partners should treat one another." 
The Pfizer executives said the company has been interested in acquiring Warner-Lambert since its Lipitor 
co-marketing pact began in 1996, but it knew Warner-Lambert's chairman at the time, Melvin Goodes, wasn't 
interested -- and, besides, the standstill agreement made it difficult. 
When Mr. de Vink took over as chairman in May and was quoted as remarking "never say never" about a merger, 
Pfizer officials figured he wasn't serious: Warner-Lambert was doing so well on its own. "We thought he was just 
joking with a reporter," said Mr. McKinnell. "We didn't realize how much depth there was to it, until it was very 
late." Indeed, Mr. Steere's initial overture to Mr. de Vink came more than five months later, in an Oct. 25 letter. 
Mr. Steere has long pooh-poohed most big drug mergers as being driven by weakness. But, he said, this one is 
different: Both Pfizer and Warner-Lambert are strong industry participants. Nonetheless, he acknowledged, 
Pfizer has "certainly had some disappointments" recently. Among other things, U.S. regulators in June severely 
restricted use of the company's antibiotic Trovan, after it was linked to several deaths from liver failure. 
But Mr. Steere insisted that Pfizer's setbacks had little to do with its hostile bid and that several of its products are 
selling briskly. He described Pfizer's new-drug pipeline as "very substantial" and said it is more promising than the 
pipeline at American Home. 
As for Lipitor, Mr. Steere said, it is a major factor in Pfizer's bid for Warner-Lambert. "If there was no Lipitor, we 
wouldn't be interested," he said. Should Warner-Lambert decide to end the Lipitor pact in a couple of years -- 
something it has the option to do -- Pfizer will still retain the "vast majority" of the share of profits it would 
otherwise have gotten, Mr. McKinnell said.

Pfizer Executives Filed to Sell Shares In Days Leading Up to Bid for Company 
Inside Track 
Pfizer Executives Filed to Sell Shares In Days Leading Up to Bid for Company 
By Danielle Sessa

Fourteen executives at Pfizer Inc. filed to sell a total of 1.2 million shares of the giant drug maker in the days 
leading up to its $74.6 billion hostile bid for Warner-Lambert Co. 
The corporate insiders, including Pfizer Chairman William Steere and President Henry McKinnell, filed their 
intentions with the Securities and Exchange Commission between Oct. 21 and Oct. 26, according to First 
Call/Thomson Financial. 
On Oct. 25, Mr. Steere expressed his interest in forming a strategic transaction with Warner-Lambert through a 
letter he faxed to its chairman Lodewijk J.R. de Vink. Pfizer's board was unaware of the letter at the time, Mr. de 
Vink says Mr. Steere told him. 
Pfizer announced its offer for WarnerLambert Thursday, just an hour after Warner-Lambert and American Home 
Products Corp. agreed to a $69 billion friendly merger agreement. Investors balked at the unsolicited offer, 
sending Pfizer down 3% Thursday; shares of the New York-based company are off about 9% since the bid. 
At the time of the filings, Pfizer had yet to reveal its intentions to acquire WarnerLambert. Securities laws 
generally don't require companies to disclose any takeover discussions, but they do bar insiders from trading on 
material information that isn't public. "The general rule in this area is disclosure or abstain from trading," says 
Joseph Grundfest, Stanford University law and business professor and former commissioner at the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
A spokesman for Pfizer says Messrs. Steere and McKinnell made their transactions on Oct. 21 "ahead of any 
knowledge of a merger combination." He says that the proposed sales have been made and that all the insider 
sales occurred during a window period that begins two days after earnings are released and lasts for 10 days. 
The sales represented a small percentage reduction in each insider's position in the company and top executives 
have to hold a certain number of shares to meet the company's stock ownership requirements, the spokesman 
adds. 
The sales come at a time when Pfizer stock is down nearly 30% from its high of $50.042 in April. Andy Summers, 
an analyst with Invesco Funds Group that holds over one million shares of Pfizer, is curious why the insiders sold 
so soon before a coming analyst meeting in New York where Pfizer usually talks about new products in the 
pipeline. 
"Usually when management believes in the prospects of the company, they tend to hold their shares," Mr. 
Summers says. 
The volume of Pfizer selling was by far the heaviest this year. Mr. Steere sold 180,000 shares; Mr. McKinnell sold 
161,000 shares; Director John Niblack sold 160,000 shares; Vice President George Milne sold 137,000 shares 
and Vice President David Shedlarz sold 105,000 shares. 
At the time of the proposed transactions, Pfizer stock traded from $38.75 to $41.75, according to First 
Call/Thomson Financial. Pfizer stock rose 12.5 cents to $35 in 4 p.m. trading on the New York Stock Exchange 
yesterday. 
The remaining sellers included the following vice presidents, who each sold under 100,000 shares a piece: Alan 
Levin, Nigel Gray, Gary Jortner, Brian Barrett, C. L. Celmente, Karen Katen, William Robison, Craig Saxton and 
Frederick Telling.

Dropping Warner-Bid Conditions Could Cost Pfizer 
Dropping Warner-Bid Conditions Could Cost Pfizer 
By Kopin Tan and Melanie Trottman

10 November 1999

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Pfizer Inc. (PFE) has found itself in a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't spot. 
The drug giant acknowledged Tuesday it is considering dropping certain conditions to its $74.6 billion takeover 
bid for Warner-Lambert Co. (WLA). Pfizer had conditioned its offer upon the successful removal of certain 
anti-takeover provisions in Warner-Lambert's merger pact with American Home Products Corp. (AHP), and has 
filed suit to throw out these arrangements. They include a $2 billion break-up fee and cross options that would 
prevent Pfizer from using the favored "pooling-of-interest" accounting for its proposed deal. 
While that would remove the skepticism and uncertainty that has dogged the Pfizer offer, it opens up a new can of 
worms. Acknowledging it is considering a combination even with the anti-takeover conditions in place will make it 
harder for Pfizer to argue in court for the removal of these same conditions, industry observers say. 
In addition, an unconditional offer - and a failure to win its case in court - would make it impossible for Pfizer to 
use pooling accounting. As a result, acquiring Warner-Lambert could produce a hit to Pfizer's earnings by as 
much as 30% next year, market watchers estimate. 
Pfizer Chief Executive William Steere said the New York company is considering whether to make its offer 
unconditional. 
That, one M&A lawyer pointed out, is tantamount to acknowledging that a combination remains possible despite 
the anti-takeover conditions. This would make it difficult for Pfizer to later argue irreparable harm and irreversible 
injury if the provisions weren't thrown out. 
In addition, Pfizer's failure to win its legal challenge would require it to account for an acquisition of 
Warner-Lambert with the purchase accounting method instead of pooling-of-interest. That means Pfizer would 
have to book a sizable amount of annual goodwill - the difference between the market value and acquisition price. 
Several market sources said a Pfizer acquisition of Warner-Lambert under purchase accounting would be 
dilutive to Pfizer's Year 2000 earnings by as much as 30%. 
Pfizer Faces Task Of Selling Cash-EPS Valuation 
J.P. Morgan analyst Carl Seiden estimates, in a worst-case scenario, that goodwill from a Warner-Lambert 
acquisition would reduce Pfizer's reported EPS by 32% in 2000. This, Seiden wrote in an industry report 
Wednesday, assumes nearly $2 billion in annual goodwill based on an estimated $81 billion in goodwill amortized 
over 40 years (assuming an $84 billion acquisition price and $3 billion in Warner-Lambert book value.) The 
goodwill hit, according to Seiden, would likely be reduced somewhat because of a likely write-off of some 
in-process research and development. 
J.P. Morgan's Seiden estimates Pfizer's 2000 earnings as reported will be $1.02 a share, compared with 
estimated cash EPS of $1.17. His estimate for Warner Lambert is $2.30 a share as reported in 2000, compared 
with a cash EPS estimate of $2.76. 
Pfizer, market players say, would face the task of getting Wall Street to abandon its history of valuing drug stocks 
on reported per-share earnings and to move towards valuation based on cash earnings.

"I think that's going to be the key hurdle," said Banc of America Securities analyst Leonard Yaffe. Still, Yaffe 
thinks investors would be willing to make a shift. 
"A lot depends on how the investment community will value a combined Pfizer/Warner-Lambert entity," said 
Michael Yellen, a portfolio manager in AIM Global Healthcare Fund, which holds stock in both Warner-Lambert 
and American Home. "If Pfizer can convince investors that the combined entity should be valued on a 
cash-earnings basis, it may take less of a hit." 
Industry observers have maintained that the $2 billion termination fee, while one of the largest in corporate 
history, isn't a big problem for Pfizer. With projected annual cost savings of $1.2 billion for a Pfizer/Warner deal, 
Pfizer can afford to pay $2 billion to break up the Warner-Lambert/AHP pact. 
But because a purchase accounting transaction would be dilutive to Pfizer, the company would have to 
significantly scale down SG&A and other expenditures in order to justify the purchase price and achieve profits 
above Wall Street expectations for Pfizer alone, noted Gruntal & Co. analyst Jeffrey Kraws. 
"This would not be easy to do or explain to shareholders," he wrote in an industry note earlier Wednesday. With 
its stock hovering just about $4 above its 52-week low of 31 7/16, Pfizer will have to defend its acquisition, Kraws 
noted. 
Shares of Warner-Lambert recently traded up 1 1/38, or 1.5%, at 91 7/16. Shares of Pfizer were changing hands 
at 34 15/16, down 1/16, or 0.2%. 
Pfizer also announced Wednesday afternoon it has added Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) as its financial adviser, in 
addition to Lazard Freres & Co. (X.LZF).

Lodevijk de Vink, chairman and chief executive of WarnerLambert, yesterday hit back at Pfizer, accusing it of 
misrepresenting negotiations between the two companies. 
Mr de Vink was responding to suggestions from Pfizer that he had snubbed Pfizer's with-premium offer in favour 
of an agreed merger with American Home Products purely to secure his own position. 
"I am sick and tired of all this innuendo about power-grabbing," he said. "My integrity is at stake here." 
Mr de Vink said his only motive in pursuing the AHP option had been to get the best deal for shareholders and 
colleagues. He said Pfizer had only mentioned the possibility of a merger with Warner-Lambert on October 25, 
days before Warner-Lambert's year-long negotiations with AHP were reaching their climax. 
Even then, he said, William Steere, chairman and chief executive of Pfizer, made only the vaguest proposal. Two 
days later his board, which was consulted at every stage, had rejected Pfizer's proposal in favour of the "concrete 
(AHP) offer in our hands". 
On Thursday October 29, a week before Pfizer launched its unsolicited bid, Mr de Vink said he informed Mr 
Steere of his board's decision to proceed with the AHP merger. "I frankly thought that was the end of it. He 
expressed his disappointment, but wished me luck." 
That is why, he said, he was so taken aback when he was informed during a live television broadcast last 
Thursday that Pfizer had made a counter-bid. "When they said Pfizer had come over the top, clearly it was a 
nasty surprise." 
Mr de Vink said he was convinced that AmericanWarner, as the combination of Warner-Lambert and AHP would 
be called, is a stronger company than a Pfizer/ Warner-Lambert merger. 
"With AHP we would have a flow of new products coming on stream when we need them," he said. 
People close to Warner-Lambert have suggested that Pfizer's unsolicited bid was prompted by the weakness of 
its pipeline, which has been damaged by at least two setbacks this year. 
Warner-Lambert believes that the strongest near-term prospect in Pfizer's pipeline is Relpax, a migraine 
medicine that is the fifth drug in its category to enter the market. 
Mr de Vink said he would now consider all options with regard to the highly successful co-promotion of Lipitor that 
Warner-Lambert has with Pfizer. 
Asked if he could ever work with Pfizer again, he said: "Pfizer was a great partner - until Thursday."

Warner-Lambert's Board Knew Of Pfizer's Interest During AHP Talks 
Warner-Lambert's Board Knew Of Pfizer's Interest During AHP Talks 
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Robert Langreth, Elyse Tanouye and Nikhil Deogun

Warner-Lambert Co.'s board was fully informed about - and interested in - what Pfizer Inc. might have to offer in 
a friendly merger after Pfizer first approached it a couple weeks ago, according to Warner-Lambert Chairman 
Lodewijk J.R. de Vink. But it ultimately decided that Pfizer's overtures weren't firm enough to derail its final 
negotiations to merge with American Home Products Corp. 
"The board has been with us every step of the way," said Mr. de Vink in an interview yesterday. Responding to 
allegations he favors the American Home bid -- and gave Pfizer the brushoff -- because it ensures he will become 
chairman in 18 months, he said: "For anyone to think I am rejecting the Pfizer deal for the job is terribly naive or 
blind to the facts." 
Pfizer's $74 billion hostile takeover bid for Warner-Lambert last week caught Mr. de Vink by surprise, he said. 
Pfizer Chairman William Steere had told him in an Oct. 27 meeting at Pfizer's New York headquarters that Pfizer 
couldn't do anything right away because it was working on another major transaction, Mr. de Vink said. 
Mr. Steere further told Mr. de Vink, 54 years old, he hadn't informed Pfizer's board about a letter he sent the 
Warner-Lambert chairman two days earlier expressing interest in a strategic transaction, Mr. de Vink said. 
A Pfizer spokesman said: "We aren't going to get into a tit-for-tat over what was said. What we have said in the 
last few days states our position very clearly: We are focused on maximizing shareholder value for Pfizer and 
Warner-Lambert shareholders." Mr. Steere wasn't available to comment. 
In part because of his conversation with Mr. Steere, Mr. de Vink said, he and his board concluded Pfizer wasn't 
making a substantive offer. By comparison, the American Home negotiations were nearly finished and, according 
to Warner-Lambert's analysis, provided the companies and shareholders with a bright future. 
Today, a mad scramble begins as both sides -- Warner-Lambert hand-in-hand with American Home, and Pfizer 
on its own -- take their arguments for their respective deals to shareholders. Mr. de Vink and American Home 
Chairman John Stafford will jet around the country during the next few days making their case for their friendly 
$70 billion merger; they likely will have only a few days before a regulatory quiet period muzzles them. 
Pfizer will argue it is a much stronger company than American Home, and thus its hostile bid represents a much 
better long-term value for Warner-Lambert shareholders. Pfizer also is gearing up for a proxy fight to oust 
Warner-Lambert's board. It has retained Innisfree M&A Inc. and Morrow & Co., proxy-solicitation firms, as it 
seeks ways to exploit Warner-Lambert's weak takeover defenses. 
"We are considering all options," Pfizer President Henry McKinnell said Saturday in an interview. "We are very 
serious about completing this merger." 
Warner-Lambert, Morris Plains, N.J., is preparing to defend itself in a proxy battle. It is considering ways -- 
including litigation -- to cut Pfizer, New York, out of an existing and immensely lucrative alliance between the 
companies to sell the blockbuster, cholesterol-reducing drug Lipitor. "We are looking at that option," Mr. de Vink 
said, but he emphasized he won't take a drastic step without consulting the board and that he would do nothing to 
hurt shareholders. 
Warner-Lambert might make a case that Pfizer's overtures violated the Lipitor pact's "standstill agreement" 
against a Pfizer takeover of Warner-Lambert and could constitute grounds for terminating the deal. Mr. McKinnell 
maintained Pfizer didn't breach the Lipitor contract when it made its offer. "We were very careful not to do that," 
he said.

In a related wrinkle, Mr. de Vink said that the Lipitor agreement required a quid pro quo in the form of a drug from 
Pfizer's pipeline. But Lipitor was a much bigger success than expected, and so far Pfizer has shared with 
Warner-Lambert only a migraine drug called Relpax, which is awaiting regulatory approval. Mr. de Vink said that 
if Relpax doesn't generate a certain level of revenue, Pfizer has to ante up another product or adjust the Lipitor 
profit split. People in Warner-Lambert's camp believe Pfizer was motivated to make its bid in large part because 
an outright acquisition could remove that obligation. 
Many investors reacted skeptically to Pfizer's all-stock offer, a surprising response to a high bidder. Pfizer fell 
Friday, a day after it launched the biggest-ever, unsolicited takeover attempt. At the 4 p.m. close of the New York 
Stock Exchange, Pfizer was down $2.6875 at $34.625. Warner-Lambert slipped just 37.5 cents to $89.875, well 
above the value of Pfizer's bid and an indication Wall Street expects a higher offer from Pfizer. American Home, 
Madison, N.J., was down 87.5 cents at $54.125. 
Wall Street's lukewarm response puts pressure on Pfizer to sweeten its bid or remove the conditions it included in 
its offer. Pfizer has said it will make an offer only if it can use a favorable accounting treatment; it is also unclear 
whether shareholders would remove Warner-Lambert's board, given this uncertainty. 
However, should a bidding war erupt, Pfizer would have the clear upper hand -- its size and higher stock multiple 
would enable it, if necessary, to pay much more than American Home. Warner-Lambert is particularly vulnerable 
to a takeover because the company lets shareholders give written consent at any point for a proxy solicitation, 
which allows a hostile bidder to gather enough votes to throw out the board at any time instead of waiting for the 
annual meeting. Furthermore, Warner-Lambert doesn't have staggered elections for its directors, so the whole 
board can be ousted at one time. 
Pfizer officials said investors shouldn't be put off by Friday's stock-price decline. "One day's stock price doesn't 
translate into future value," said Karen Katen, senior vice president and president of Pfizer's U.S. pharmaceutical 
operations. Mr. McKinnell said the hostile bid "is not out of weakness. We are one of the strongest companies in 
the industry, which is why we think we are the ideal partner for Warner-Lambert." He added, "The shareholders I 
have talked to have run the analysis and they see it being accretive to both companies." 
Mr. de Vink said the first time he brought Pfizer's overture to his board's attention was by telephone at 11 a.m. on 
Wednesday, Oct. 27. They discussed the faxed letter he had received from Mr. Steere on Monday, and the 
conclusion was, "Let's call Steere and go meet him and see what is on his mind," said Mr. de Vink, who called Mr. 
Steere soon after and jumped on a helicopter to New York for a 2:30 meeting. 
During the 45-minute meeting, Mr. Steere said Pfizer and Warner-Lambert would be a great combination, 
although he wasn't ready to do a deal yet, Mr. de Vink said. 
Mr. de Vink pressed for details, asking how Warner-Lambert senior management would fit in. Mr. Steere would 
only say they could work it out, adding that he plans to retire soon. Mr. de Vink quipped that such a deal "isn't 
what I had in mind in my first six months as CEO of Warner-Lambert." Mr. Steere reminisced about his first six 
months on the job when he, too, received an offer, which he declined, Mr. de Vink said. 
"There was nothing specific -- there was no offer which was relevant or signficant," Mr. de Vink said of the 
meeting. 
Mr. Steere asked for another meeting, but Mr. de Vink said only that he would call back soon. Mr. de Vink 
telephoned his board the next morning and told directors about the meeting, pointing out that Warner-Lambert 
was in the final stage of discussions with American Home, but that the Pfizer offer had few details and the timing 
was unclear. 
Mr. de Vink says he told Mr. Steere that afternoon on the phone, "Bill, we have given it very careful thought. I've 
discussed it with the board and we believe at this time we aren't interested in pursuing an option with Pfizer," 
adding that Warner-Lambert is "proceeding with another strategic option." Mr. de Vink said he emphasized the 
Lipitor co-marketing agreement with Pfizer would be honored. 
Mr. Steere expressed his disappointment, but said he was happy Warner-Lambert would honor Lipitor and 
wished him good luck on the other deal, Mr. de Vink recalled. 
On Thursday, when Pfizer launched its hostile bid, Mr. Steere wrote in a letter to Mr. de Vink: "I want to reiterate 
that I have repeatedly tried over the past few weeks to discuss with you the merits of a combination between 
Pfizer and Warner-Lambert. Unfortunately, our efforts have been rejected -- a response that is particularly 
disappointing given the substantial success represented by our partnership in developing and marketing Lipitor."

With the companies now taking their cases to shareholders, several large Warner-Lambert investors said Pfizer's 
conditional offer lacks credibility. "I don't think this is a serious bid by Pfizer; it's probably not going to fly," said 
David Alger, president and chief executive of Fred Alger Management, which owns about two million shares of 
Warner-Lambert and is a sizable holder of Pfizer. 
Given the drop in Pfizer's stock on Friday, "the two bids are currently pretty similar on a dollar basis," said Scott 
Sindelar, portfolio manager at Strong Capital Management, another Warner-Lambert shareholder. He called the 
proposed merger of equals with American Home "a pretty good deal." 
However, Janice Hester Amey of the California State Teachers' Retirement System, which owns millions of 
shares in all three companies, said: "The American Home Products and Warner-Lambert deal was crafted in 
secret and is now being crammed down shareholders' throats, and I think that's egregious."

In NEW YORK item headlined "Warner-Lambert CEO says Pfizer 
delayed talks - NYT" please read in second paragraph ...de Vink 
said...instead of...de VinkHe said...(correcting name). 
A corrected repetiton follows: 
NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The chief executives of Warner-Lambert Co. and Pfizer Inc. met in late October 
and discussed a possible merger, but the conversation was vague and Pfizer's CEO put off further talks, 
Warner-Lambert's CEO told the New York Times. 
Warner Chairman and CEO Lodewijk J.R. de Vink said the brief talks with Pfizer never resulted in a real offer. 
Pfizer later made an unsolicited offer worth $73 billion for the company after Warner announced it planned to 
merge with American Home Products Corp. . That merger is worth about $70 billion based in Friday's closing 
stock prices. 
The Warner CEO told the Times he had received a letter from Pfizer Chairman and CEO William Steere on 
October 25 regarding speculation Warner was considering a merger and Steere's interest in talking. 
Since July, Warner and AHP executives had been in merger talks, the Times said. 
Before the October 25 letter, de Vink had no indication Pfizer was interested in anything more than the two 
companies' joint marketing agreement for Lipitor, Warner's cholesterol drug, the newspaper said. 
The two men met on October 27, and discussed issues including what role Warner's management team would 
have in a combined company, the makeup of a combined board, how a combination would affect shareholders 
and what synergies the companies would have, de Vink told the Times. 
Steere said he had not discussed the combination with his board and asked whether the two could talk at a later 
date because he was "busy with another transaction," de Vink told the newspaper. 
De Vink would not say what company was involved, but industry executives said Pfizer was trying to negotiate a 
merger with Monsanto Co. , according to the Times. 
It said De Vink told Steere that a later meeting would be too late, and after a subsequent meeting with his board, 
he called Steere to say Warner was not interested.

SOMETIMES a corporate manoeuvre comes along that changes the landscape of an industry. One is Pfizer's 
attempt to bust up the cosy drugs marriage between American Home Products and Warner Lambert by making a 
$80billion hostile bid for Warner. This is trailblazing stuff and may encourage big corporate moves across the 
market, not least because Pfizer wants to buy sight-unseen a high technology business just weeks before the 
millennium bug is forecast by some to cause havoc for global capitalism. 
Not since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts' bid for RJR Nabisco has the market in corporate assets been so altered by a 
single move. It is the world's biggest hostile bid, an all-paper offer showing amazing confidence on the part of 
Pfizer's management. It has stunned the sector, as Garth Alexander reports on page 10. Suddenly no drug 
company management, however big their business, is immune from the consolidation frenzy; to a man they are 
on bid alert, plotting deals or working how to avoid being swallowed up. 
That Pfizer should be the raider is itself a surprise. To date it has focused on organic growth. But now William 
Steere, its chairman, is bidding to create what analysts call the world's first "tier one" drug company. One 
attraction is Warner's Lipitor anti-cholesterol drug. At present it is a Pfizer-Warner joint venture but Steere wants 
control. But his long-term motivation is more fundamental. If he can pull off the deal he will have 7% of the global 
market, the kind of share Glaxo Wellcome would have had if it had succeeded last year in merging with 
SmithKline Beecham. That puts him in a good position of building one of what many think will be a group of about 
half a dozen drug giants that in the early years of the new millennium may each hold 10% of the market. 
Scale is important in drugs. The cost of researching new ones is soaring, the time to get them to market is 
lengthening and the time they are covered by patent yet available for sale is shortening. In the next decade 
therefore only the very rich or the very lucky will be able to stay in the global game. 
So where does this leave Glaxo, Britain's flagship drugs group? Firstly it vindicates Sir Richard Sykes, its 
chairman, in trying to forge a SmithKline merger. But it also shows Sykes may have been lacking in imagination in 
thinking that after his Wellcome raid he could make progress only through agreed deals. Steere has shown he 
might now need to think otherwise. 
Last, the bid shows Sykes cannot afford the luxury of allowing others to set the consolidation agenda. It is time to 
get his SmithKline talks rekindled, because other drug companies, notably Roche and Novartis, may also be 
running their slide rules over Jan Leschly's company. Now is a good time to start making moves. Leschly will 
retire next spring or earlier, removing one of the stumbling blocks to a new deal. Sykes would happily have 
SmithKline's Jean-Pierre Garnier as his chief executive and Garnier's board is hungry for action. It includes for 
instance Sir John Browne, one of Britain's few world class industrialists and the architect of the BP Amoco 
marriage. 
Shell shocked 
THEY used to call it the shell game and at one point the Stock Exchange got sniffy and changed the pitch. The 
men in the listing department did not wholly approve of the fact that a tea or rubber company might be a 
plantation company or even a moribund pile of gilts one day and wake up the next as a vehicle of some go-go 
entrepreneur. Thus they meddled around with what could and could not be done in the interests of getting round 
flotation rules and saving on costs. 
Fortunately, and much to the delight of the City's more inveterate gamblers, the game lives on and some 
companies that began as obscure counters are now models of establishment respectability. Take WPP, one of 
the world's top three marketing combines and an FTSE100 index constituent. It began as Wire & Plastic Products,

Page 51 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
a tiny supermarket basket maker. Then there is Carlton Communications, one of the three top terrestrial television 
businesses. As a legal entity it began as Fleet Street Letter, an unlisted securities market quoted minnow that 
published tip sheets. Then along came Michael and David Green with a collection of television and printing 
services companies called Tangent Industries and the rest, as they say, is history. 
The man behind Fleet Street Letter was Nigel Wray, a former Singer & Friedlander merchant banker, and it is 
fascinating to see that Wray is at it once again, being a leading light at Knutsford, a tiny Manchester clothing 
importer, which made City history last week when its shares leapt 1,500% in a day, as John Waples reports on 
page 5. Wray is a serial "shell" man and entrepreneur, a fascinating reader of markets and shrewd evaluator of 
the money making abilities of his fellow men. He made millions out of Carlton, then made as much again or more 
out of Burford, which began life in 1986 as a shell called Gilbert House Investments. 
But nothing will have prepared him for the bull market froth that greated last week's news that he, his business 
partner, Nick Leslau, Archie Norman of Asda and Julian Richer of Richer Sounds were coming together at 
Knutsford. Within three days his #1.5m investment was worth #156m and if he spends a further #1.5m on his 
warrants the holding goes up in value north of #300m, a stunning verdict on the value creating abilities of Wray 
and his colleagues. 
Their aim is to take over and revitalise undervalued but asset rich retail and leisure companies and they clearly 
have some appropriate skills. Leslau is a great property man; Norman oversaw Asda's rescue and revitalisation to 
the point where it became Wal-Mart's #6.7billion entry ticket into British retailing; Richer even won a place in the 
Guinness Book of Records for his hi-fi shops and is now helping the Prince of Wales build a food manufacturing 
company, having previously dispensed advice to Asda and to Halifax, the consumer bank. 
That said, Knutsford's current valuation of #502m is an embarrassment to all four and they must be praying that 
the company will disappear from the limelight for a while, giving them time to work on their plans and line up 
financing. At a certain point of time they will need to organise a big share placing as part of the funding of 
whatever bid they make and that can only take place at way below the current price. What is fascinating is that 
the City reckons it is open season on even the biggest companies in the retail sector such as Marks & Spencer, 
Sainsbury and Storehouse. Cool heads might think such targets are way, way out of reach but in these markets 
anything, or virtually anything, is possible.

Pfizer's offer for Warner-Lambert as it prepared to merge with American Home Products will have a huge effect 
on Britain's own drug companies. Garth Alexander reports from New York 
JOHN STAFFORD and Lodewijk de Vink were happily explaining to a television reporter the details of the 
mega-merger of their two companies, American Home Products (AHP) and Warner-Lambert (WL) last Thursday. 
Stafford proudly declared it would create the world's largest drug company with a $145billion (#89billion) market 
value and annual sales of $26billion. As he reeled off the deal's advantages he made no attempt to hide his relief 
that he had finally found a partner. Two previously announced mergers - with SmithKline Beecham and Monsanto 
- collapsed one after another last year, leaving AHP looking like a bride who had been twice abandoned at the 
altar. Now, on his third attempt, Stafford seemed to have struck lucky. 
Then the reporter interrupted the live broadcast to tell him he was hearing through his ear-phone that a much 
higher bid had just been made for Warner by Pfizer, America's No2 drug company. Would the AHP-Warner deal 
still go ahead, he asked. 
The two chief executives tried to look calm, although the smiles vanished from their faces. Stafford soberly said 
they would do whatever was in shareholders' best interests. De Vink said he would have to see the details before 
commenting. But there was a glint in his eye. Pfizer was offering to buy his company for $82.4billion, $10billion 
more than AHP. 
If the link with Warner collapses, AHP is itself likely to become a bid target. Investors' concerns about several 
court cases and its ailing agribusiness virtually halved its shares between April and September. 
Todd Warnock at CS First Boston says: "Pfizer's bid to acquire Warner-Lambert exposes both Warner-Lambert 
and American Home Products to other potential bids." 
Thus did Pfizer kick off a battle that is likely to spark a fresh round of consolidation, one that will have huge 
ramifications for Britain's biggest drug businesses, AstraZeneca, Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline. 
Not surprisingly the shares of almost every drug company soared on the expectation that mergers would sweep 
through what remains a fragmented industry. At the moment no firm commands more than 5% of the market. 
Even a combined AHP and Warner would have a mere 5.5% of sales. The only two companies to lose ground 
last week were AHP, which closed the week at $55, and Pfizer, which closed at $34.75. Warner-Lambert finished 
at $89.94, up 12.5%. 
Verin Mehta, a New York drug-industry consultant, says: "It is hard to name any company that is not a candidate 
for merging. You can essentially combine any two companies. The floodgates are open." 
Rumours were circulating thick and fast by the end of last week, including talk that Glaxo and SmithKline would 
resurrect last year's aborted merger talks. Switzerland's Novartis and Roche were said to be interested in merging 
with Glaxo while Germany's Bayer is also on the prowl. Monsanto, the American life-science company, is the 
target of several suitors. 
Stafford and De Vink said size was an important factor. They said they were joining forces to make it easier to 
shoulder the high cost of bringing new drugs to market and the huge expense of promoting and marketing them. 
They said the merger would lead to operational savings of $1.2billion a year.

Page 53 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Despite the advantages of size the strong personalities of some drug industry bosses have tended to militate 
against consolidation. Both AHP's would-be deals broke down last year in part because Stafford, who has run the 
group for 18 years, insisted on playing a leading role in the merger, say analysts. A similar conflict scuttled last 
year's talks between Glaxo and SmithKline. 
Yet last week Stafford, 62, made it clear he did not want the AHP-Warner merger to fail on his account. He said 
De Vink, 54, would be chief executive of the new company, which will be named AmericanWarner, while he would 
be chairman for 18 months and then step aside to let De Vink to take that job, too. He said: "Lodewijk will be the 
boss." 
In another attempt to ensure the deal did not collapse, AHP made Warner agree to pay a $2billion break-up fee. 
These fees are often included in American mergers to deter rival bidders and to compensate abandoned partners. 
Pfizer claims the AmericanWarner break-up fee is illegal and invalid and "egregiously large". It has asked a 
Delaware court to revoke the agreement on the ground that Warner directors breached their fiduciary duties to 
shareholders by signing it. 
Warner is a successful group, with well-known drugs such as Rezulin (for diabetes) and Neurontin (an 
anti-convulsant) and consumer products, such as Listerine and Benadryl. But its growth has largely depended in 
the past two years on one blockbuster, Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol drug whose annual sales could reach $6billion 
in three years. Warner badly needs new products. An AHP merger could provide them because it is sitting on its 
strongest "pipeline" in years. 
Best known for drugs such as Enbrel (rheumatoid arthritis) and for consumer products such as Advil, Robitussin 
and Chap Stick, AHP expects approval soon for a new ulcer drug and a pneumonia vaccine for children. It is also 
testing a promising new anti-depressant. 
But a cloud still hangs over AHP. Last month it agreed to pay as much as $3.75billion to settle claims over its 
fen-phen diet pill (a combination of two drugs, Redux and Pondimin). It took a $4.75billion third-quarter charge to 
cover lawsuits involving claims that the drugs cause heart-valve disease and a potentially fatal lung disease. 
Stafford says he is confident the settlement will be approved by a Philadelphia judge. But the judge has already 
rejected one diet-pill settlement involving AHP and some lawyers have threatened to demand a bigger payment. 
According to the agreement, consenting lawyers will receive as much as $429m in fees from the settlement. 
Since it was forced to recall Redux and Pondimin in 1997 AHP has suffered a series of embarrassing setbacks. In 
early 1998 it withdrew its application for approval of Verdia, a blood-pressure medication, amid concerns that it 
could cause liver damage. 
Then it had to recall Duract, a painkiller that was blamed for causing fatal liver problems. In July it suspended 
shipment of a rotavirus vaccine after it was linked to bowel obstructions in 32 infants. In August it agreed to pay 
$50m to settle claims made by users of its Norplant birth-control devices. 
But Pfizer has had its share of troubles, too. It has been left with a $300m stock of Trovan, an antibiotic, after 
sales were suspended in Europe and sharply restricted in America when the Food and Drug Administration found 
that 14 cases of acute liver failure were "strongly associated" with the drug. 
Last month a British company by the name of Trovan won the largest-ever trademark-infringement award against 
Pfizer. A Los Angeles jury ordered the pharmaceutical giant to pay Trovan $143m for stealing its name, which 
had been registered in America seven years earlier; Trovan makes microchips that are implanted in pets to aid in 
their recovery and identification if they are lost or stolen. 
Pfizer's blockbuster impotence pill, Viagra, has also been controversial, having been linked to the deaths of a 
number of elderly users. But sales continue to soar thanks to Pfizer's expert marketing and expensive advertising 
campaigns. Bob Dole, the former presidential candidate, has even been persuaded to appear in a television 
commercial to admit he suffers from what Americans politely call "erectile dysfunction". 
Viagra attracted 5.28m prescriptions in its first six months on the market, breaking the record for the most 
successful introduction of any drug in American history. Earlier this year Pfizer proved just how effective its 
marketing department is when it broke Viagra's record with a new drug for arthritis, Celebrex, which racked up 
7.4m prescriptions in its first six months. 
Despite these successes some analysts fear Pfizer is short of new drugs. Two of its top three sellers were 
developed by other companies and are sold through joint marketing agreements. Celebrex was developed by

Page 54 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Monsanto. The third bestseller, Lipitor, was developed by Warner-Lambert. Analysts believe Lipitor, which De 
Vink predicts "should become the biggest-selling prescription drug in the world", is a big reason for Pfizer's 
interest in Warner. 
Steve Gerber of CIBC World Markets in Los Angeles says: "Pfizer wants the other half of Lipitor that it does not 
currently have." 
Stafford insists his bid is fair and should reflect Warner's market value because American Warner is a merger of 
equals; Warner shareholders will own 50% of the new company. 
But William Steere, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive, hinted last week that he was so keen to acquire 
Warner he might be prepared to pay even more than the 30% premium he had already put on the table. Whether 
that will be enough to deter others from entering the bidding remains to be seen.

MAN IN THE NEWS - WILLIAM STEERE - David Pilling meets Pfizer's fiercely ambitious chief executive who is 
determined to achieve a merger with rival Warner-Lambert. 
William Steere, the boss of Pfizer who this week unleashed the biggest unsolicited bid in corporate history, is a 
man of few words but of sardonic, understated humour. 
So when he wrote a terse letter on Thursday to Lodewijk de Vink, chairman and chief executive of 
Warner-Lambert, saying that Pfizer was "pleased to make the following proposal", no-one had any doubt as to 
what he was getting at. 
Roughly translated, it meant: "You've betrayed me. You've betrayed your shareholders. And I'm going to get you." 
The letter, in which Mr Steere urged Mr de Vink to abandon a merger with American Home Products in favour of 
one with Pfizer, was full of such menacing pleasantries: "Given what we could accomplish together for all our 
most important constituencies, we remain surprised that you have not shown more interest in joining forces. 
"Nevertheless, we stand ready to meet at any time to discuss our proposed transaction." 
Mr de Vink did not return Pfizer's calls. 
The sequence of events that has led to this icy stand-off is one of the most extraordinary in the consolidation of 
the pharmaceutical industry, which has been played out like a slow-moving chess game over the past decade. 
In October, Pfizer got wind of the fact that Warner-Lambert - with which it co-promotes Lipitor, a clot-busting drug 
that has transformed Warner-Lambert's fortunes - was in talks with AHP about a possible merger. Mr Steere met 
Mr de Vink to tell him that a deal with Pfizer would be a more powerful, logical combination. 
As Pfizer tells the story, the only problem was that Mr de Vink would not be top dog. Mr Steere, the most 
experienced and probably the most respected pharmaceutical executive around, still had 18 months to go before 
retirement. What's more, he had already annointed Hank McKinnell, his long-serving number two, as his 
successor. 
Mr de Vink, 54, politely turned down the offer and, says Pfizer, assured the company he was not about to do a 
deal with AHP. It therefore came as some surprise when Mr Steere opened his newspaper this week to find that 
the AHP deal was on. 
It is thanks to Mr Steere's stewardship in the 1990s that Pfizer was in a financial position to take out a $70bn 
company with hardly a moment's hesitation. Only this week, Mr Steere was bragging that he could "do a hostile" 
on anyone, with the possible exception of Merck. 
A thin, wiry man with a passing resemblance to Ross Perot, the 63-year-old Mr Steere, who became chief 
executive officer in 1991, has transformed Pfizer into a lean company. Quietly spoken, and slow in his delivery, he 
gives the impression of a man who has worked out all the options and is convinced he has picked the right one. 
A fitness fanatic, usually tucked up in bed by 10pm, one of his first actions after becoming CEO was to install a 
gym at Pfizer's plush New York headquarters. Ever since, the company has been beefing up its performance, 
mainly by spending more than its competitors on research and development, as well as on sales and marketing.

"He has led the rest of the group," says Sergio Traversa, a pharmaceuticals analyst with Mehta Partners. "He has 
set the pace for the industry by divesting the non-pharmaceuticals businesses and by believing that drugs can be 
sold just like any other product." 
In the process, he has transformed Pfizer from one of the industry's also-rans into probably the most feared 
company in the pharmaceuticals world. 
In the early 1990s, when other drugs companies were diversifying in response to the perceived threat of Hillary 
Clinton's healthcare reform, Mr Steere went the other way. "He stood tall and said: 'No, this is our business and 
we're going to build it up from here,' " says Bob Kirby, an analyst with Edward Jones, a St Louis-based brokerage. 
Mr Steere jettisoned 20 businesses, including medical devices, to concentrate on the high-margin 
pharmaceuticals business. He expended huge effort in the fast-growing US market, building up a big sales force 
and designing clinical trials to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of Pfizer's drugs to penny-pinching Health 
Maintenance Organisations. 
A scientist by background - he graduated from Stanford University in 1959 with a degree in marine biology - Mr 
Steere nevertheless opted to spend his 40-year career at Pfizer in marketing and management positions. 
He instantly recognised the huge potential of Viagra, the male impotence pill, and did little to rein in the media 
circus that did so much to publicise the drug. (Amazingly, other companies, including Glaxo Wellcome, had 
stopped developing impotency drugs of their own, believing there was no market.) 
So successful has Pfizer been in generating growth that, until this week, it was regarded as one of a handful of 
companies with an overtly anti-merger philosophy. But in an interview this week, Mr Steere said this had never 
really been the case. 
"People ask me why I'm opposed to mergers. I'm not opposed at all. We've been growing so fast without a 
merger that to me it would have been a distraction. But it depends on who you merge with," he said. 
"I have this view. There's a lot of great intellectual property out there. If we don't have it in-house we ought to go 
out and get a piece of it." 
This year, for the first time in many years, the need to grab some new products has increased. The withdrawal of 
Trovan, a powerful antibiotic, in Europe and the cancellation of another highly promising drug-candidate has left 
Pfizer's pipeline looking relatively weak. In these circumstances, the chance to digest Warner-Lambert - with all 
the cost-cuts that a takeover implies - proved hard to resist. Only a few days ago, on Monday in the Roosevelt 
hotel in New York, executives from Pfizer and Warner-Lambert were congratulating each other after receiving an 
award for their successful co-promotion of Lipitor. 
But by the end of the week, thanks to the lightning intervention of Mr Steere, Pfizer's partner had suddenly 
become its prey.

Pfizer fires off $128bn bid for Warner-Lambert

Pfizer fires off $128bn bid for Warner-Lambert

Leave it to Pfizer to bring some sex, drugs and rock'n'roll to Wall Street. 
The company that is famous for its baby blue Viagra impotency tablet stunned America's investment community 
on Thursday by launching a hostile, $US82.4 billion ($128 billion) takeover bid for rival drug company 
Warner-Lambert. 
The surprise came because Warner-Lambert had announced one day earlier that it was to consummate a 
$US72 billion merger with another industry leader, American Home Products. 
Whichever deal eventuates, it will result in the creation of the world's largest drug company, lifting the combine 
over current front-runner Merck & Co. 
Pfizer is an aggressive company, whose chairman and chief executive officer, Mr William Steere, has made little 
secret of his aim to become the largest. 
But it faces an uphill battle to win the bidding war, despite putting more money on the table. 
Mr Steere told Warner-Lambert directors that his company and theirs were "the two fastest-growing companies 
in the industry, and would represent a compelling combination and excellent strategic fit, creating superior value 
for all our shareholders". 
The Warner-Lambert deal with AHP is billed as a merger of equals, and is structured in such a way that both 
boards of directors contend that they can ignore counter bids with little danger of raising the ire of shareholders. It 
might require more that just a higher bid for Pfizer to win the day. 
The two have signed so-called cross options, and have agreed to a break-up fee of $US2 billion if the deal does 
not eventuate. Pfizer has backed its takeover with court action that contends that the options and fee are illegal 
and invalid, and that Warner-Lambert directors breached their fiduciary duty. 
Pfizer is offering 2.5 of its shares for every Warner-Lambert stock unit. The rival bid involves AHP offering a little 
under 1.5 AHP shares for every Warner-Lambert share. 
Talks between the two have been under way since the northern summer, and Pfizer is said to have become 
interested more recently. 
Apart from Mr Steere's desire to outgun his drug industry rivals, Pfizer has an interest in the future of 
Warner-Lambert because the two share marketing rights in one of the world's hottest new drugs, an 
anti-cholesterol treatment called Lipitor. 
Analysts say that either combination should have few problems passing regulators because even the largest drug 
company currently only holds about 5 per cent of the market in any given product. 
There is little overlap in any of the three companies. 
News of the bidding war brought a welcome rise in many drug companies on Wall Street, including Pharmacia & 
Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Schering-Plough and Johnson & Johnson

WILMINGTON, Del., Nov 5 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc., seeking in court to stall Warner-Lambert Co.'s proposed $70 
billion merger with American Home Products Corp., has not yet filed a motion for a hearing that would begin the 
process, court records showed on Friday. 
In a lawsuit filed on Thursday in Delaware Chancery Court, Pfizer requested an emergency restraining order 
against a break-up fee and stock options as a way to slow down the merger. But Pfizer did not, as is typical, 
follow up immediately with a hearing motion. 
New York-based Pfizer, the No. 2 U.S. drug company and the maker of impotence drug Viagra, on Thursday 
made an unsolicited all-stock bid - worth $73 billion based on Pfizer's closing share price Friday - for 
Warner-Lambert, the nation's ninth-largest drug manufacturer. 
Warner-Lambert is a prized target because its cholesterol-fighting drug Lipitor is projected to be a significant 
money maker - for either friendly suitor AHP, the No. 5 U.S. drug maker, of Madison, N.J., or rival Pfizer. 
Pfizer's Delaware attorney Franklin Balotti declined comment Friday. Calls to the company's New York counsel 
were not returned. 
A Delaware lawyer with an extensive practice in mergers and acquisitions said the lawsuit "is a placeholder." 
"Pfizer is just trying to get chancery jurisdiction as opposed to having Warner-Lambert sue them" on their home 
turf in Morris Plains, N.J., where they might get a more sympathetic hearing. 
He said the first action by Pfizer would likely be to file an amended complaint fleshing out its allegations and 
possibly requesting expedited proceedings. 
At issue is whether Pfizer is legally free to bid, whether its bid is absolutely conditioned on having the break-up 
fee and options provisions removed, and the timing of any court action. 
"If Pfizer's bid is based on what the Chancery Court decides to do about the break-up fee and the options, then a 
ruling would be needed before the Warner shareholders vote on the merger, possibly two months from now," said 
the lawyer, who declined to be named. "That kind of litigation is fact-intensive and it's unlikely to be heard in a 
relatively short time." 
Corporate litigator David Finger said, "It is possible that this lawsuit is a prelude to an attempt by Pfizer to enjoin 
the proposed merger to allow fair consideration of Pfizer's bid. We will just have to wait and see." 
There is also a question about whether Pfizer Chairman William Steere is correct when he said in a letter 
Thursday to Warner-Lambert Chairman Lodewijk de Vink, that Pfizer was no longer barred from making an offer 
for Warner-Lambert by a 1996 standstill agreement with Warner, the lawyer said. 
"We haven't seen the 1996 ... agreement between Pfizer and Warner and we haven't heard from 
Warner-Lambert yet. But you can bet they're looking for a way to say the 1996 agreement forbids Pfizer from 
making a bid even now," the lawyer said.

Pfizer mounts $82bn bid for US drugs rival. 
Pfizer mounts $82bn bid for US drugs rival.

US drugs group Pfizer yesterday unleashed an $82.4bn ( #49.6bn) unsolicited bid for competitor 
Warner-Lambert, just hours after Warner-Lambert had announced the terms of its $72bn agreed merger with 
American Home Products. 
The Pfizer all-stock bid is the largest unsolicited bid ever, and threw AHP and Warner-Lambert into disarray. 
Executives from both firms halted media interviews and at lunchtime in New York yesterday were declining to 
comment on how they might respond. 
Non-friendly takeovers are a rarity in the pharmaceutical industry and trading in all three companies' shares was 
suspended as investors digested Pfizer's $96.50 per share surprise bid. 
"This combination would create the strongest, most dynamic pharmaceutical company in the world," said William 
Steere, chairman and chief executive of Pfizer. 
Pfizer's move follows Warner-Lambert's rebuffing of its efforts to enter merger talks. 
The two companies have been partners in a marketing alliance for cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor since 1997, 
and Mr Steere said yesterday that in recent weeks he had told Lodewijk de Vink, Warner-Lambert's chief 
executive, of his interest in merging Pfizer with Warner-Lambert. 
Following Warner-Lambert's announcement that it intended to combine with AHP, Pfizer said that a prior 
standstill agreement preventing it from bidding for Warner-Lambert was no longer valid. 
"I have repeatedly tried over the past few weeks to discuss with you the merits of a combination between Pfizer 
and Warner-Lambert," Mr Steere wrote to Mr de Vink. "Unfortunately, our efforts have been rejected." 
Mr de Vink would be unlikely to have a senior role if Pfizer won control of Warner-Lambert. "We will pursue them 
very doggedly and, quite frankly, they will have to deal with their own shareholders," a Pfizer executive said. 
Pfizer argues that it makes more sense for Warner-Lambert to merge with it than accept a no-premium deal with 
AHP. The suggestion is that Mr de Vink's keenness to ignore its overtures is driven by the proposed management 
structure of American-Warner. Mr de Vink would initially be chief executive, then chairman and chief executive 
after 18 months. 
If Pfizer acquires Warner-Lambert it would create a company with annual revenues of $28bn and a market 
capitalisation of more than $200bn, making it easily the largest pharmaceutical company in the world. It could 
unleash a fierce round of sector consolidation. 
Pfizer said the companies would have combined research and development expenditure of $4bn, with annual 
cost savings of more than $1.2bn. 
A victory for Pfizer would be particularly damaging for AHP. In the past two years its has tried to merge with 
SmithKline Beecham of the UK and Monsanto of the US. 
A complicating factor could be Pfizer's insistence that Warner-Lambert agrees to terminate certain parts of its 
agreement with AHP, including a $2bn break-up fee, so that Pfizer's deal can be carried out as a pooling of 
interests. Lex, Page 24 Smash and grab, Page 34.

#48bn DRUGS DEAL SHOCK. 
#48bn DRUGS DEAL SHOCK.

THE world's drugs industry was today coming to terms with Viagra maker Pfizer's huge #48 billion offer for US 
rival Warner-Lambert - the biggest unsolicited bid in corporate history. 
If New York-based Pfizer succeeds in its bold dash it will create the globe's biggest phamaceutical group - a giant 
putting under threat rivals such as Glaxo-Wellcome in the UK. 
Pfizer's raid was timed to spoil the party for Warner-Lambert which was just celebrating the announcement of its 
agreed #43 billion tie-up with American Home Products. 
As well as producing the anti-impotence drug Viagra, Pfizer makes the anti-depressant Zoloft, while 
Warner-Lambert is best known for its Trident and Dentyne chewing gum, cholesterol-lowering Lipitor treatment 
and diabetes aid Rezulin. 
William Steere, Pfizer chairman and chief executive, said: "The combination would create the strongest, most 
dynamic pharmaceutical company in the world." 
But today the Warner-Lambert board said it was "not in a position" to tae any action on the Pfizer bid - believing 
its tie-up with AHP to be in the best interests of shareholders. 
Pfizer said that it had repeatedly approached Warner-Lambert over the past few weeks to discuss a possible 
business combination, but claimed it had been rebuffed. 
Its all-stock offer would give 2.5 of its shares for each of Warner-Lambert's 854.7 million shares. 
The company claimed that the planned marriage between its target and AHP terminated an agreement which had 
prevented Pfizer making a play for Warner-Lambert. 
Suspended 
Shares in the three comanies' shares were suspended in trading yesterday while investors grappled with the 
dramatic news. 
Hostile bids are rare in the phamaceutical industry but financial experts were expected more mega deals in the 
industry in reaction to developments. 
Hugh Johnson, of First Albany, said: "It certainly sends a very clear signal that there is going to be meaningful 
consolidation in the drug business." 
"I think that is something we knew but I don't think anybody thought it would be quite so dramatic as this." 
BOSSES' #10m BUY-OUT DEAL 
By CHRIS MORLEY 
Industrial Correspondent 
A TOP hi-tech specialist Midlands engineering firm has been sold in a #10 million management buy-out deal, it 
has been revealed.

Page 64 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Tamworth-based Darwell Fabrications has now passed into the hands of the team led by seasoned industrial 
executive Peter Murray. 
The 41-year-old manufacturing and engineering expert was parachuted in to head the firm as managing director 
after being introduced by Birmingham-based advisers with Gresham Trust. 
Mr Murray clocked up 13 years with Perkins Engines and was operations director when he moved to join 
Bernstein Group as manufacturing director. 
In 1996 he joined industrial giants Alstom as managing director of the firm's railway rolling stock building division. 
Darwell, which has a base at Kenilworth as well as its Tamworth operation, carries out precision engineering for 
customers in the bus, coach and truck building sector. 
It also wins orders with businesses in the construction equipment, specialist and defence vehicle trade and those 
producing medical eqiuipment. 
The sale, the first negotiated by Gresham's new Birmingham office, was negotiated with the present managing 
director, Martin Smith. 
Mr Murray claimed that the #12 million turnover company could look forward to impressive future growth. 
Expansion 
He said: "I believe that with strong account and logistics management, together with continued investment in the 
latest technology, Darwell has the potential for considerable expansion, consolidating its existing strong position." 
Simon Inchley, who led the deal for Gresham, said: "Darwell is a good example of the type of company Gresham 
aims to back in the Midlands. 
"It is a company which is applying the latest technology to a traditional sector." 
The controlling managment team includes finance director Trevor Slater, aged 50, and Paul Walters as technical 
director. 
Mr Inchley joins the board as a non-executive director representing Gresham interests.

Warner-Lambert Rejects Pfizer's Surprise $80 Billion Offer 
Warner-Lambert Rejects Pfizer's Surprise $80 Billion Offer

MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. -(Dow Jones)- Warner-Lambert Co. Friday rejected fellow drug giant Pfizer Inc.'s $80 
billion acquisition proposal, instead favoring its planned $72 billion merger with American Home Products Corp. 
Warner-Lambert (WLA) said its board strongly believes the American Home (AHP) transaction is best for the 
long-term interests of its shareholders, and that its decision was also based on the conditions and the provisions 
of Warner-Lambert's contract with American Home. 
On Thursday, Pfizer (PFE) made a surprise counteroffer for Warner-Lambert in an effort to break up 
Warner-Lambert's combination with American Home. 
Hours after Warner-Lambert and American Home announced their plan to combine in the largest merger in the 
history of the pharmaceutical business, New York-based Pfizer jumped into the fray by offering 2.5 of its shares 
for each share of Warner-Lambert. Pfizer also filed a lawsuit to break up the Warner-Lambert-American Home 
deal. 
The Pfizer offer, which values Morris Plains, N.J.-based Warner-Lambert at $93.125 a share based on Pfizer's 
Thursday closing stock price, was made in a letter from Pfizer Chairman and Chief Executive William Steere to 
Warner-Lambert Chairman Lodewijk J.R. de Vink. Pfizer confirmed the offer publicly Thursday afternoon. The 
transaction would represent about a 30% premium to Warner-Lambert's average share price over the last month. 
Pfizer's offer represented the largest unsolicited takeover offer in history and underscored the risk of attempting a 
merger of equals without offering a premium to shareholders. That is the case with American Home's deal with 
Warner-Lambert, which offers little benefit to Warner-Lambert's shareholders, especially when placed next to 
Pfizer's offer. 
The proposed merger between American Home and Warner-Lambert would involve the exchange of 1.4919 of a 
share of American Home for each Warner-Lambert share and one share of the new company for each share of 
American Home. It would value Warner-Lambert at about $82 a share, based on American Home's Thursday 
closing stock price. 
Both companies' shareholders would own approximately 50% of the combined company, to be called 
AmericanWarner Inc. The transaction has been approved by both boards of directors. 
The merged AmericanWarner entity would have cost savings of about $1.2 billion and revenue of nearly $24 
billion, based on 1998 results, which would make it one of the top handful of global drug giants. Its 
prescription-drug business would surpass the current leader Swedish-Anglo concern AstraZeneca PLC, which 
makes Prilosec, a heartburn drug that had the highest sales of any drug on the market. 
Including over-the-counter medicines and other health-care products, a combined American Home and 
Warner-Lambert would rank third in world-wide sales behind No. 1 Merck & Co. and No. 2 Johnson & Johnson. 
But AmericanWarner pales in comparison to the possible Pfizer and Warner-Lambert combination, which would 
have annual revenue of $28 billion, a market capitalization of more than $200 billion, annual cost savings in 
excess of $1.2 billion, and a research and development budget of $4 billion. 
As is the case with the American Home proposal, Pfizer said its deal with Warner-Lambert would have "little 
significant overlap or redundancy" and immediately add to earnings, before restructuring charges. Pfizer also said 
its offer includes combining both companies' boards.

Page 66 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Ratings agency Standard & Poor's appears to find both scenarios attractive. On Thursday, S&P placed its ratings 
of American Home and its long-term ratings of Warner-Lambert on CreditWatch with positive implications. The 
agency also affirmed Warner-Lambert's A-1-plus commercial paper rating, as well as all S&P ratings for Pfizer. 
S&P said the ratings in question affect a total of about $11 billion in debt. 
The agency said that if American Home successfully merges with Warner-Lambert, the combined company will 
benefit from a broader product portfolio, the largest R&D program in the global pharmaceutical industry and a 
financial profile characterized by little debt leverage net of cash. 
However, S&P said a combination of Warner-Lambert and Pfizer will create an even larger company with similar 
business characteristics, but almost no debt on a net basis. 
Pfizer has been attempting to court Warner-Lambert in recent weeks, even as talks between Warner-Lambert 
and American Home heated up. Negotiations between Warner-Lambert and American Home had been going on 
for several months. But the talks intensified in October after American Home reached an agreement with plaintiffs' 
lawyers to settle lawsuits over its controversial Redux and Pondimin diet drugs and took a $4.75 billion charge. 
Pfizer's estimated $150 million market value is twice that of American Home, and its stock price trades at a higher 
multiple, which still gives it added firepower to wrest control of Warner-Lambert from American Home. Pfizer 
trades at about 39 times next year's earnings, while American Home trades at nearly 29 times next year's 
earnings. 
Pfizer's stock price has soared in recent years thanks to such fast-selling drugs as Viagra and lucrative 
copromotional agreements involving Warner-Lambert's blockbuster cholesterol drug Lipitor and Monsanto Co.'s 
(MTC) arthritis drug Celebrex. But its shares have lost some steam since April and are well off their 52-week high 
of nearly $50. 
The Warner-Lambert-American Home deal carries a breakup fee of as much as $2 billion. Pfizer said its offer, 
which has been approved by the company's board, is conditioned on removal of the breakup fee and stock option 
transfers which are part of the Warner-Lambert and American Home Products agreement. Pfizer filed a lawsuit in 
a Delaware court to enjoin the $2 billion break-up fee and lock-up option granted by Warner-Lambert to 
American Home. 
Pfizer argued the fee and lock-up option are "illegal and invalid" and that Warner-Lambert directors breached 
their duties by approving the provisions. 
Warner-Lambert's board on Friday said the claims of Pfizer's lawsuit against the company are without merit and 
it plans to defend its actions. 
American Home is the company behind such household names as Advil, Robitussin and Chap Stick and the top 
selling hormone replacement drug Premarin, the world's most prescribed medicine. American Home is struggling 
as a result of lawsuits and product safety questions and has been flailing about for a merger partner after two 
previous deals collapsed. 
Warner-Lambert makes Certs mints, Schick razors as well as the cholesterol drug Lipitor. It has been the 
nation's fastest-growing drug company for the past two years. 
Pfizer has had a partnership with Warner-Lambert since 1996 involving the joint development and promotion of 
Lipitor. The partnership included a standstill agreement that prohibited Pfizer from making an unsolicited bid for 
Warner-Lambert. However, the standstill agreement expires if Warner-Lambert enters into a merger or 
acquisition agreement with another company.

NEW YORK, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc.'s tough, but soft-spoken chief executive may have found a short-cut to 
realise his stated dream of becoming the country's biggest drug maker before he retires. 
William Steere, who worked his way up from detail man to chairman and CEO of the second largest drug 
company in the U.S., stunned Wall Street on Thursday by publicly launching a bid for his marketing partner and 
rival, Warner-Lambert Co. for $82.4 billion. 
Less than a day earlier, Warner-Lambert had agreed to merge with American Home Products Corp. in a deal 
valued at $72 billion, to create AmericanWarner, the world's largest drug company. 
The 63-year old Steere, who works out in the company gym, has won the respect of many. 
"He's a very capable individual. He's done an exceptional job putting Pfizer into the top tier. He's very hard 
working," said Hemant Shah of HKS & Co. 
Steere joined Pfizer in 1959 and was promoted through various marketing and management positions until he 
was named president and chief executive officer in 1991. In 1992, he added the title of chairman of the board. 
Wall Street had expected Steere to fulfil his vow to make Pfizer the no. 1 drug company through internal growth - 
launching blockbusters, such as impotence drug Viagra and co-marketing stellar drugs, such as 
Warner-Lambert's cholesterol-lowering Lipitor. 
But with a merger, he would get there much faster than the year or two timeline he had established, to leapfrog 
Merck and Co. Inc. , which is the U.S. leader. 
The chief executive's bid for Warner-Lambert follows shedding of noncore assets to focus on higher-margin 
pharmaceuticals. 
"Steere has a strong personality, very regimented. He's wanted Pfizer to be bigger than Merck for a while," said 
an analyst who asked to remain anonymous. 
"He doesn't want to see still another company bigger than Pfizer, although AmericanWarner would not be a threat 
in any specific area," he said. 
The analyst predicted that Steere would emerge the winner in the battle for Warner-Lambert. 
"I don't think he'll walk away without Warner-Lambert. The company has to save face right now. They can't be 
defeated by AHP," he said.

Pfizer To Offer $82.4 Billion For Warner-Lambert 
Pfizer To Offer $82.4 Billion For Warner-Lambert

(Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is making an unsolicited, stock-for-stock bid of about $82.4 billion, or 
about $96.40 a share, to acquire Warner-Lambert Co. (WLA), which last night agreed to merge with American 
Home Products Corp. (AHP) for $72 billion in stock. 
Pfizer's bid, which is being made in the form of a letter from Pfizer Chairman William Steere to Warner-Lambert 
Chairman Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, is significantly more than the agreement Warner-Lambert reached with 
American Home, according to the letter. Pfizer has been attempting to court Warner-Lambert in recent weeks. 
The stunning move is expected to be formally released within the hour or so, these people say. The transaction 
would be about a 30% premium to Warner-Lambert's average share price over the last month. The offer is for 
2.5 shares of Pfizer for each share of Warner-Lambert. 
Combined, the company would have annual revenue of $28 billion, annual cost savings in excess of $1.2 billion, 
and a research and development budget of $4 billion. The deal is expected to be accretive to Pfizer's earnings per 
share. 
The proposal, however, is dependent upon Warner-Lambert agreeing to terminate certain options that it is 
granting AHP that would make a so-called pooling of interests accounting deal extremely difficult. 
Warner-Lambert and AHP have agreed to break-up fees and the granting of options to each other. 
Besides Pfizer having a stock-market value twice as large as AHP - about $150 million as of Thursday morning - 
its stock price trades at a higher multiple, giving it added firepower to wrest control of Warner-Lambert from AHP. 
Pfizer trades at about 39 times next year's earnings, while AHP trades at nearly 29 times next year's earnings. Its 
stock has been on a tear in recent years thanks to such fast-selling drugs as Viagra and co-marketing 
agreements on Warner-Lambert's Lipitor and Monsanto Co.'s (MTC) Celebrex. But its stock has lost some steam 
since April, and is off its 52-week high of just over $50 a share. 
It changed hands Wednesday at 38 11/16, up 3/16. Warner-Lambert changed hands at 83 11/16, down 1/8. 
Since 1996, Pfizer has had a partnership with Warner-Lambert, and as a result of this, Pfizer has agreed to a 
standstill, meaning that it wouldn't make an unsolicited bid for the company. But the standstill expires if 
Warner-Lambert enters into a merger agreement with a rival company. 
In a letter dated Oct. 25, Pfizer Chairman Steere wrote to Warner-Lambert Chairman de Vink, expressing 
interest in a transaction with Warner-Lambert. 
On Wednesday, after The Wall Street Journal reported on the talks between American Home and 
Warner-Lambert, Steere wrote another proposal to De Vink. 
In the letter dated Thursday, Pfizer Chairman Steere said that "I want to reiterate that I have repeatedly tried over 
the past few weeks to discuss with you the merits of a combination between Pfizer and Warner-Lambert. 
Unfortunately, our efforts have been rejected - a response that is particularly disappointing given the substantial 
success represented by our partnership in developing and marketing Lipitor." 
Prior to American Home and Warner-Lambert consummating their deal, Steere's Oct. 25th letter said that Pfizer 
would be interested in merger talks that would lead to giving shareholders of Warner-Lambert "the highest 
possible value."

Page 69 of 71 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
In the letter dated Wednesday, Steere reiterated that a Pfizer transaction would represent "the best possible price 
for your shareholders." 
The bid by Pfizer is one of the largest takeover attempts of all time and the largest unsolicited takeover bid. The 
fast-moving developments underscore the risk of attempting a so-called no-premium merger of equals where 
shareholders don't get a big premium. American Home is offering no premium to the shareholders of 
Warner-Lambert. 
While Pfizer couldn't have made an unsolicited bid on its own because of the so-called standstill agreement it 
signed with Warner-Lambert, the standstill is not enforceable once Warner-Lambert enters into a definitive 
merger agreement. That opened the door for Pfizer. 
Pfizer's Steere said in his letter to Warner-Lambert's De Vink that "Given what we could accomplish together for 
all our most important constituencies, we remain surprised that you have not shown more interest in joining 
forces. ... We urge you and Warner-Lambert's board of directors to recognize the immediate and long-term 
superior value of this transaction."

NEW YORK, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. on Thursday made an $82.4 billion unsolicited bid 
for Warner-Lambert Co., just hours after the target announced a $72 billion friendly merger with American Home 
Products Corp. 
The AHP and Warner-Lambert deal would give rise to the world's largest pharmaceutical and consumer health 
products company. 
Pfizer already has a relationship with Warner-Lambert as the two companies have co-marketed the 
cholesterol-reducing drug Lipitor since 1997. Current annual revenues for the drug are about $3.5 billion. 
Last year, AHP had two failed mergers with British drug maker SmithKline Beecham Plc and St. Louis-based 
Monsanto Co. 
PFIZER 
New York City-based Pfizer Inc. is a producer of both pharmaceuticals and health care products. Most notably, 
the company makes the well-known impotency drug Viagra and Zoloft, an anti-depressant. Successful consumer 
products include Bain de Soleil sunscreens, Barbasol shaving cream and Visine eye drops. Incorporated in 1900 
as Chas. Pfizer & Co., the company moved into drug production when it began to mass-produce penicillin for the 
war effort in 1941. Fiscal year end: December CEO: William Steere 1998 employees: 46,400 Revenues: Third 
quarter 1999 net sales: $3.42 billion Third quarter 1999 net income: $906 million Third quarter 1999 diluted EPS: 
$0.23 Third quarter 1998 net sales: $3.11 billion Third quarter 1998 net income: $667 million Third quarter 1998 
diluted EPS: $0.17 
NOTE: Pfizer said the 1999 and 1998 figures do not include one-time charges stemming from inventories of the 
antibiotic drug Trovan. The Food and Drug Administration said 14 cases of acute liver failure were "strongly 
associated" with the drug, leading to a sharp reduction in its use. 
WARNER-LAMBERT 
Morris Plains, N.J.-based Warner-Lambert is a diversified producer of chewing gums such as Trident and 
Dentyne, Schick razors, Listerine mouthwash and over-the-counter health products, including the allergy drugs 
Benadryl and Sudafed. Originally known as William R. Warner & Co. when it was formed in 1886, it was bought 
by Pfeiffer Chemicals in 1908 and adopted its current name in 1955. Fiscal year end: December CEO: Lodewijk
