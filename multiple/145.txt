Procter & Gamble Co (P&G) will buy Tambrands for US$2 billion in cash and assumed debt. The deal, set to 
boost sales of tampons worldwide, will be P&G's biggest acquisition. P&G will pay $50 a share in cash, or $1.85 
billion, for the maker of Tampax products, which account for almost half of the world's tampon sales. P&G, which 
makes Always and Whisper feminine products, will also assume $150 million in debt. The purchase fits with P&G 
chairman John Pepper's plan to develop or buy well-known brands that it can market around the world.
