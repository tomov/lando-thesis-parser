Wachovia May Seek Asset-Mgmt Joint Venture With Sun Life 
Wachovia May Seek Asset-Mgmt Joint Venture With Sun Life

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Wachovia Corp. (WB) is in talks about buying MFS Investment Management and may 
be eyeing a joint venture with MFS parent Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF). 
Under this scenario, Wachovia would fold MFS into its Evergreen Investments asset-management unit, said 
bankers who aren't involved in the negotiations. Sun Life would get an ownership stake in the unit, but Wachovia 
would retain majority control. 
Such a deal would resemble Merrill Lynch & Co.'s (MER) recent transaction with Blackrock Inc. (BLK), in which 
Merrill sold its asset-management business to Blackrock in exchange for a stake of just under 50% in the 
combined entity. The structure also would mirror Wachovia's 2003 joint venture with Prudential Financial Inc. 
(PRU), in which Prudential transferred its retail brokerage unit to Wachovia in exchange for a 38% stake in the 
joint venture. 
The Wachovia-Prudential collaboration "is an example of one of the rare joint ventures that have actually worked," 
said Howard E. Steinberg, a former Prudential executive now with New York law firm McDermott Will & Emery 
LLP. "It would not surprise me to see Wachovia replicate something like the structure they had for the 
Prudential-Wachovia transaction." 
One issue will be cost. The price Sun Life is seeking for MFS has emerged as a sticking point in the talks with 
Wachovia, according to a person familiar with the matter. Structuring the transaction as a joint venture wouldn't 
necessarily mitigate those concerns, the person added. 
Wachovia Vs. Mellon? 
Mellon Financial Corp. (MEL) is also said to be looking at MFS, which Sun Life began considering options for a 
month ago. 
But a joint venture with Wachovia, whose executives say they are in the market for asset-management deals, 
could be more attractive than simply selling MFS to Mellon, as Sun Life would continue to reap profits from the 
lucrative business. In addition, MFS management wants to retain an operational role, which would be more likely 
at Wachovia than Mellon, according to people in the industry. 
Like MFS, Evergreen is headquartered in Boston, and it's run as a separate entity within Charlotte-based 
Wachovia, making a joint venture feasible. At Mellon, the asset-management arm is central to the company's 
business, and the company is less likely to cede much power to MFS officials. 
"I know that MFS would like to keep management involved, and I think it would find it easier to structure such a 
deal with Wachovia than with Mellon," said an investment banker specializing in asset-management deals. 
Wachovia, however, may be wary about pursuing another deal after its acquisition of Golden West Financial 
Corp. irked shareholders and analysts. Wachovia's stock price has fallen 7% since May 5, the last business day 
before the deal was announced.

Page 3 of 47 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
John E. McDonald, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, estimated MFS could fetch $5 billion and that an 
outright acquisition probably would be "slightly dilutive" for Wachovia in 2007. 
Mellon's shares trade at a higher multiple than Wachovia's, potentially allowing the Pittsburgh-based company to 
offer a sweeter package to Sun Life. 
Evergreen Expansion 
A deal with MFS would dramatically expand Evergreen, whose chief executive, Dennis H. Ferro, has said he 
wants it to become one of the Top 10 U.S. asset managers. Evergreen oversees about $258 billion in assets. 
MFS boasts about $170 billion in assets under management. Another benefit: MFS is weighted toward 
equity-related assets, an area in which Wachovia executives have said they are looking to bulk up. 
Evergreen's expansion strategy recently has focused on internal growth and buying boutique asset-management 
shops. Most recently, Evergreen in June acquired Metropolitan West Capital Management LLC in a deal whose 
terms weren't disclosed. MetWest had $5.3 billion in assets under management. 
Wachovia executives say publicly that they're amenable to asset-management deals. 
"We like the asset-management business...and we would do deals in that space" if they meet strict financial 
criteria, said Chief Executive G. Kennedy Thompson on a conference call this week. In that presentation, 
Wachovia noted it will use excess capital for "financially attractive, shareholder friendly acquisitions" as well as 
repurchasing stock. 
Wachovia is happy with the Prudential joint venture, raising the possibility that it could serve as a model for future 
deals. 
"We couldn't be more pleased with the way the Prudential deal has worked," Wachovia's finance chief, Tom 
Wurtz, said in an interview. Financially and culturally, "it's worked out very well." He wouldn't comment on 
speculation about a bid for MFS. 
Representatives of Evergreen, MFS and Sun Life declined to comment.

NOW THAT Wachovia owns Golden West Financial -- its biggest takeover gamble -- the pressure is building on 
the expansion-hungry U.S. bank to demonstrate that it can gracefully digest the gargantuan deal. 
Early clues will emerge Monday, when Wachovia reports third-quarter results. Many investors remain skeptical, 
despite five months of sweet-talking led by G. Kennedy Thompson, chief executive of Wachovia, the nation's 
fifth-largest bank in terms of market capitalization. When investors initially frowned on the deal, the Charlotte, 
N.C., bank scheduled a rare follow-up conference call five days after the announcement to try to clear the air. 
One concern: Signs of the deflating real-estate bubble are increasingly evident at California's Golden West, 
deepening worries that loans made by the thrift during the long-running mortgage boom could turn sour on 
Wachovia's watch. Golden West specializes in types of adjustable-rate mortgages that critics claim could be risky 
in a deep downturn. 
Wachovia announced its $23.91 billion takeover of Golden West in May, and the transaction was finally 
completed earlier this month. As of the deal's completion, on Oct. 2, Wachovia shares were down 6.1% since the 
acquisition agreement, compared with a 0.29% rise in the Dow Jones Wilshire U.S. Banks Index. It marks the first 
major Wachovia deal since Mr. Thompson took over in 2000 in which the bank's share price failed to increase in 
the period between the announcement and closing dates. 
Also, significantly, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio has fallen below that of Bank of America Corp. for the first 
time in more than three years, an indication that investors think its hometown rival's stock is more valuable. That 
bruised not only Wachovia's pride but also the value of its stock as currency in future deals. 
Wachovia shares yesterday were up 48 cents at $56.50 as of 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
Frustrated Wachovia officials insist the payoff from the Golden West purchase looks as promising as ever. "We 
go in with a little bit of a chip on our shoulder because we've got something to prove," says Bob McGee, leader of 
the Wachovia integration team at Golden West, the second-largest U.S. savings and loan behind Washington 
Mutual. Wachovia also points out that this is by far the biggest deal of Mr. Thompson's tenure, and the bigger the 
deal, the more investors tend to fret. 
Supporters of the deal, including some institutional investors, argue Wachovia is being unfairly tarnished by 
comparisons with previous acquisitions that turned out to be disastrous, like the bank's 1998 purchase of the 
Money Store, a lender to consumers with blemished credit histories, for $2.1 billion. The unit was shut down two 
years later. In contrast, Mr. Thompson has deftly handled the integrations of three major bank takeovers, most 
recently SouthTrust Corp., a Birmingham, Ala., bank acquired in 2004 for $13.7 billion, while improving customer 
service, supporters say. 
"We've got a lot of faith in Ken Thompson and his team that they know what they're doing. That's why we're 
sticking with the stock," says William Hackney III, managing partner of Atlanta Capital Management, an Atlanta 
firm with $8.9 billion in assets under management, including about 1.2 million Wachovia shares valued at $67 
million. 
Softening in real estate is starting to show up in Golden West's numbers. Through the end of August, loan 
originations declined 7.3% from a year earlier. While Golden West has a conservative record for underwriting 
loans, nonperforming assets and restructured debts rose to 0.41% of total assets from 0.28% in August 2005.

Page 5 of 47 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Real-estate concerns have made some investors more leery about exposure to option adjustable-rate mortgages 
that Wachovia inherited through the takeover. Such loans are the most popular product at Golden West, allowing 
borrowers to choose how much to pay each month, with unpaid interest added onto the mortgage and increasing 
the loan's balance. In the second quarter, Golden West reported that it had $915 million in accumulated unpaid 
interest on loans and mortgage-backed securities -- a big leap from $666 million in the first quarter and $160 
million in last year's second quarter. 
Herb Sandler, who led Golden West for 39 years with his wife, Marion, says Golden West is sufficiently insulated 
from risk because of its 25 years of experience with its version of the option ARM. He adds that the S&L never 
strayed from its emphasis on loans on moderately priced homes to borrowers with strong credit records or 
substantial assets. 
"What people seem to be intellectually incapable of understanding is the difference between a problem with a 
product and a problem with underwriting," he says. The Sandlers remain part-time consultants, talking with Mr. 
Thompson at least once a week. 
"Golden West may be the best in that industry, but they still are in an industry that's being painted with a negative 
brush. That's going to be a problem for Wachovia," concludes Edward Najarian, a Merrill Lynch analyst who last 
month cut his rating on Wachovia to "neutral" from "buy." Nearly 40% of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial 
have a "hold" rating on Wachovia shares, up from about 20% last month. Merrill Lynch has an 
investment-banking relationship with Wachovia and was an adviser on the Golden West deal. 
James Schmidt, manager of John Hancock Regional Bank Fund, holder of 1.2 million Wachovia shares at Sept. 
30, says the ultimate success of the takeover could hinge on how many Golden West customers lured by the 
thrift's unusually high interest rates on deposits stick around for Wachovia's much longer menu of financial 
products. Aggressive marketing by Wachovia won't start for at least a year. "I'm betting on Wachovia," Mr. 
Schmidt says. Still, "I have to admit I'd feel better if we were two years out," he says.

Merrill Cites Thrift Deal in Lowering Wachovia to 'Hold'

Merrill Cites Thrift Deal in Lowering Wachovia to 'Hold'

WASHINGTON -- Another in a string of analysts to downgrade shares of Wachovia Corp. said that he is not 
comfortable with its $25.5 billion deal for Golden West Financial Corp. and that he worries it might make other 
large acquisitions. 
Edward R. Najarian of Merrill Lynch Co. lowered his rating on the $553.6 billion-asset Wachovia to "hold" from 
"buy" Friday. 
In a note to clients, he wrote that "it may prove more difficult than we previously anticipated" for the Charlotte 
banking company to integrate the $128.8 billion-asset Golden West, a thrift company based in Oakland, Calif. 
The deal was announced May 7 and is expected to close in the fourth quarter. 
Mr. Najarian said Golden West's emphasis on selling certificates of deposit, strong competition in the West, and 
market concerns over slowing mortgage originations were chief among the reasons he downgraded Wachovia. 
He also pointed to a "market perception that Golden West's option ARM-centric business mix will permanently 
dilute" Wachovia's price-to-earnings multiple. 
Mr. Najarian also said he fears Wachovia will pursue more large acquisitions to fill out its western operations and 
"to execute its universal banking model." 
But he wrote that Wachovia has several things working in its favor, including its "very strong" and diverse core 
banking and financial service franchise, its 4.1% dividend yield, and a PE discount compared with other large-cap 
banking companies. 
At least five analysts besides Mr. Najarian have downgraded Wachovia since it announced the Golden West 
deal, with many raising issues similar to those outlined in Mr. Najarian's note. 
The stock is down more than 7% since May 7. On Friday it closed down 0.04%. 
G. Kennedy Thompson, Wachovia's chairman, president, and chief executive, has addressed such concerns 
several times in recent months and did so again on Sept. 13 at the Lehman Brothers 2006 Financial Services 
Conference in New York. 
He acknowledged that mortgage applications were going down, but he projected "good production" once the 
Golden West deal closes. Wachovia would add several mortgage-origination channels after buying Golden West, 
which should "help us mitigate the weakness in the mortgage market," he said. He also said that an end to 
interest rate increases would widen margins at Golden West. 
Mr. Thompson also discussed mergers and acquisitions at the Lehman conference. He said he would wait at 
least 24 months before making another large deal. 
"We're going to get this one done exactly right before we do anything significant," he said, though he did not rule 
out smaller acquisitions during that span in retail banking, asset management, or brokerage. 
Wachovia said Friday that it does not comment on analyst reports.

Kevin Fitzsimmons, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP, said Mr. Thompson's statements provide a 
"two-year window where you are relatively free" of a large deal. 
"I don't know how he could have made it any more clear," the analyst said Friday. 
Mr. Fitzsimmons downgraded Wachovia to "hold" from "buy" after it announced the Golden West deal. A month 
later he restored it to "buy" because of the sell-off in the stock. "Nothing has changed in my positive thesis," he 
said Friday. "I don't see anything that has dramatically changed in terms of the environment for Golden West. 
The deal doesn't come without risks, but Wachovia will go about the integration in a very methodical way, and 
they are fully aware of the mortgage environment."

Second of three parts 
Every conversation about who will survive the banking industry's ultimate consolidation coalesces around five 
companies: Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wachovia Corp., and Wells Fargo & 
Co. 
These companies are generally acknowledged to be in the best position to remain preeminent national banking 
companies decades from now. Beyond the Big Five, the endgame contenders seem either aspirational or 
delusional. 
Size may not be predictive in the case of Washington Mutual Inc., the sixth-largest company in the U.S. banking 
industry. Despite its $348 billion balance sheet, Wamu does not get a lot of consideration as an endgame player. 
Maybe it is because the industry has an entrenched prejudice against thrift companies; maybe it is because the 
company's mortgage-bloated loan portfolio makes it less diversified, and seemingly smaller, than companies with 
half its assets. 
Real estate loans, the vast majority of them home loans, make up 72% of Wamu's assets. Mortgage-backed 
securities make up another 7%, and a $25 billion portfolio of loans held for sale makes up another 6%. The 
October purchase of Providian Financial Corp. gave Wamu a card portfolio that now makes up 2% of its assets. 
Commercial loans make up under 1%, or just over $2 billion. 
Wamu gets some recognition for its advances in retail banking, not the least of which is its Occasio line of 
branches -- "They're so original, we took out a U.S. patent on them," the company advertises on its Web site -- 
and it has $210 billion of deposits, making it the country's sixth-largest depository institution by that measure. But 
97% of its deposits are in nontransaction accounts, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data, and its 
retail innovations have done little to enhance perceptions of the company's prospects. 
Many of the industry's most persistent merger and acquisition rumors involve Wamu -- as prey rather than 
predator. But its natural acquirers are relatively few, given its size. Citi and HSBC Holdings PLC have been 
identified as buyers in rumors that are based less on specific intelligence than on perceived strategic fit. 
Wamu would not make Kerry Killinger, its chairman and chief executive, available for an interview. 
"We believe that achieving the five-year targets of our present strategic plan will result in top-quartile industry 
performance, which should lead to superior long-term shareholder return," a spokeswoman for the Seattle 
company wrote in an e-mail. "Wamu's board of directors recently concluded that successful execution of our 
strategic plans would likely lead to the creation of significant shareholder value and instructed management to 
execute those plans as an independent company." 
CULTURE VULTURES and SNOWBIRDS 
The largest U.S. commercial banking companies not considered to be odds-on survivors are U.S. Bancorp, with 
$213 billion of assets, and SunTrust Banks Inc., with $181 billion. They are regularly rumored to be acquisition 
fodder, even though they are staking their own claims to survival.

Page 9 of 47 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
A decade ago U.S. Bancorp was considered one of the country's preeminent banking companies, but after a 
string of value-destroying deals, it lost its status as an industry darling and became just another example of 
acquisitive excess. 
SunTrust is known for its conservative credit culture, and despite its enthusiasm for M&A, it is better remembered 
for the acquisition it could not get done -- a hostile bid for the old Wachovia Corp. -- than for the ones it has made. 
Both companies have expanded their fee-income businesses, including asset management and mortgages. But 
SunTrust makes money from an investment-banking subsidiary and reports little processing income; U.S. 
Bancorp's foray into investment banking was ill-fated, but the company has made a name for itself as a 
processor. 
Jerry Grundhofer, U.S. Bancorp's CEO, is generally admired -- as is L. Phillip Humann, SunTrust's CEO. Neither 
would speak for this story. 
U.S. Bancorp has named Richard Davis, 48, who is considered a charismatic and inspirational leader, as a 
successor to Mr. Grundhofer. SunTrust's succession plans are less clear. 
Bench strength and clarity of succession can play a part in making it to the endgame. 
"Many of the transactions of the last year or two have occurred because there was no successor management," 
said David Daberko, the chairman and CEO of National City Corp. "That may have been a choice of the board not 
to worry about it, and just rise with the current guy and sell." 
Investors, too, read the executive-office tea leaves closely. 
"What an acquirer is typically looking for is a management team that is ready to cash out," said Tim Woolston, a 
portfolio manager with Boston Advisors LLC. "If you've got a young guy that just came in and just started running 
his own show, it is unlikely he is going to want to sell out, even though it may make sense." 
There are other interesting points of comparison, and other obvious points of departure, between SunTrust and 
U.S. Bancorp, but their different business mixes, operational philosophies, and succession planning may be 
relative subtleties in handicapping their chances of survival. 
Ultimately, it may come down to demographics. 
SunTrust has an enviable base in the Sun Belt. U.S. Bancorp operates in some desirable markets but is generally 
perceived as competing in the Rust Belt. Stronger population and wealth growth may trump execution; more 
people and more money is a good recipe for profitable banking. 
Bankers are not locked into their current markets, and they are willing to do surprising things to break out of their 
markets. Several have announced wholesale branching programs in new markets; others have paid six times 
tangible book value for an existing network in a hot market. 
U.S. Bancorp may face an additional obstacle: After disappointing investors with previous acquisitions, executives 
have repeatedly vowed that they are not looking at transformative deals -- a statement that leaves open the 
question of how to thrive without them. 
For the same reason that SunTrust may have a better shot at the endgame than U.S. Bancorp, BB&T Corp. may 
have a better chance than Fifth Third Bancorp or National City. 
Mr. Daberko has claimed that demographics are not a limiting factor for Nat City, which is also squarely in the 
Rust Belt. But his actions may speak louder than his words. 
The day after its July 10 announcement that it was considering strategic alternatives for its mortgage subsidiary, 
the Cleveland company said it would pay 3.3 times tangible book value and 23 times earnings for Harbor Florida 
Bancshares Inc., a thrift company in Fort Pierce. Less than three weeks later Nat City said it would buy Fidelity 
Bankshares Inc., a thrift company in West Palm Beach, this time paying 3.7 times tangible book value and 30 
times earnings. 
Even with the deals -- and a driving commitment to become the best possible retail banking company -- few count 
Nat City among the endgame winners.

Page 10 of 47 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
And there is a downside to having operations in attractive markets: Stumbling is usually lethal. With plenty of 
vibrant companies looking to get into those markets, not delivering on the promise of superior demographics may 
encourage shareholders to find a company and management team that can. Underperformers generally languish 
in unattractive markets; in hot markets, they get swallowed. 
"It cuts both ways," said John Allison, the chairman and CEO of BB&T. "If you perform, it helps you. If you don't 
perform, it makes you more vulnerable, because someone else is going to want the franchise." 
The evidence is plain: "How many [large] Florida banks are left?" asked H. Rodgin Cohen, a banking lawyer in the 
New York office of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. "It's not just demographics." 
NOT DEAD YET 
Tweaking branch networks -- or even remaking them through efforts to branch into new markets -- is occasionally 
motivated by the endgame. But a fundamental rethinking of business lines and subsidiaries is much more central 
to endgame strategies. 
Nat City is selling its mortgage subsidiary, as is KeyCorp. Bank of New York Co. decided to sell its retail 
operations to JPMorgan Chase in exchange for that company's corporate trust business. 
Even though it lowered its stake in BlackRock Inc. through that company's deal to acquire Merrill Lynch 
Investment Managers, PNC Financial Services Group Inc. recommitted to asset management. It beefed up its 
investment bank by acquiring the middle-market firm Harris Williams & Co. 
A couple of years ago U.S. Bancorp dumped its Piper Jaffray investment bank, and decided to focus instead on 
processing businesses. 
Wamu is selling its asset-management arm, as is Comerica Inc. Citi already unloaded its unit in an asset swap 
with Legg Mason Inc. 
Nat City admits that its wealth-management unit still has not justified its long-term existence. ("It remains to be 
seen whether we can really be a competitive force in that business," Mr. Daberko said.) 
Each divestiture seems to trigger additional speculation that the vaunted financial services supermarket model is 
dead. Citi's swap with Legg Mason, combined with the sale of the last of its insurance-underwriting operations last 
year -- the very operations for which it had fought so hard in 1998 -- was seen as a particularly fitting nail in the 
coffin. 
But the obituaries were either premature or based on a rudimentary understanding of the supermarket model. 
Last year bankers recognized $44 billion of fees from insurance sales, and $28 billion from asset management, 
according to SNL Financial LC. Supermarkets do not manufacture all of their products; neither do banks. The 
model is based on fulfilling customer demand, and not on monopolizing the supply chain. 
"We don't manufacture insurance products, and we don't manufacture mutual funds now," said Sallie Krawcheck, 
Citi's chief financial officer. "But by no means do we offer fewer products, or a less rich range of products, to our 
customers -- in fact, the opposite. Through open architecture, we can offer our clients and customers the fullest 
range of products and services that are out there." 
Mr. Allison said he has always found the supermarket analogy inaccurate. 
It implies that "you just have one store through which you distribute a multitude of products," he said. "Financial 
services companies will sell multiple products through different distribution channels, [but] it doesn't look or feel 
like a supermarket." 
The trend toward broader product suites and multiconstituency service, which is accelerating, does not exactly 
sound like the death knell for the premise that launched the supermarket model. 
For the biggest of the big, the solution is easy: Offer everything to everybody. Citi's list of subsidiaries is 33 pages 
long and includes about 1,500 companies. 
MIX MASTERS 
Trying to develop Citi's or JPMorgan Chase's capacity in short order is not realistic, and most companies have to 
be tactical in their choices. There are enough ancillary businesses -- asset management and trust banking,

Page 11 of 47 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
mortgage banking, credit cards, processing, insurance brokerage, investment banking, factoring, equipment 
finance, online banking, merchant banking, trading -- to supplement and diversify lending that bankers do not 
need to claim a special facility in each one. 
The sale of various subsidiaries is the result of companies' choosing what businesses they believe they need, and 
in which ones they believe they excel. These are the kind of strategic decisions that shape the endgame. 
Richard Fairbank, the chairman and CEO of Capital One Financial Corp. said bankers should be more ruthless in 
that discipline. 
A "key strategic lever that banks have -- I don't think they are using it very much -- is to pick the businesses you 
are in," he said. "You need to be diversified, but you don't need to be in all of them. We are very carefully picking 
our businesses." 
There are several prisms through which banking companies are making these decisions. 
"To understand the terms of competition it is less useful to think about the traditional market segments -- like 
commercial banks, credit card banks, mortgage banks, insurance companies, and investment banks -- and more 
useful to think about who is originating assets, who is distributing assets, and who is holding assets," said Peter 
Fisher, a managing director at BlackRock and a former Treasury Department under secretary. 
That is a good way for bankers to figure out comparative advantages, and in many cases it naturally overlaps with 
the decision between retail and wholesale businesses. U.S. banking companies that are not yet assured of the 
endgame -- but are seeking it -- are generally emphasizing retail. 
"This is a retail-based economy," Mr. Daberko said. "Our tax incentives are retail and consumption-based; the 
population expands, the need of individuals for financial services expands. You've got to be strong in retail 
banking if you are going to be a winner." 
That is why Nat City's commitment to becoming "the best retail bank we can possibly be" is "more than anything 
else what I worry about," he said. 
Emphasizing retail businesses is the logical result of bankers' doing what they know, but economics also dictate 
retail strategies. 
"A regional consumer bank can establish size and scale being in two or three contiguous states," said William 
Harrison, JPMorgan Chase's chairman. "If they have a broad branch presence, and the product capability to 
deliver, they can be a leader in those states -- and they get some of the benefits of operating scale." 
However, "that works better in retail banking than it does in investment banking," he said. "In investment banking, 
if you really want to win, you've got to be global." 
The big banking companies that find themselves at the top of investment-banking league tables generally have 
not gotten there by organic growth, and a wave of acquisitions in the sector in the late 1990s proved that buying 
capacity is not easy, either. Some of the transactions have been near disasters, so bankers are tentative about 
trying similar ones. 
The industry's previous failures don't disprove the conceptual imperative behind the strategy. Cultures change -- 
however slowly. 
Banks are moving toward the mercenary culture of investment banks more than investment banks are moving 
toward the conservative culture of banks, but the common ground is broader than it was a decade ago. Evidence 
points to further convergence. 
The career path of the commercial banker is not as conventional as it once was, when rookie bankers started in 
the branch making residential loans and aimed for middle-market business lending. Success in the middle market 
led to large corporate lending, where lenders hoped to develop enough relationships to influence the bottom line 
-- and eventually wield that influence as an executive. 
Not anymore. 
Members of the next generation of banking "don't care about managing people, they don't care about going to the 
corner office, and they are not going to be loyal to any institution or entity," said Rod Taylor, an executive recruiter 
in Atlanta who specializes in financial services.

Page 12 of 47 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"Their loyalty is to their customer relationships, and they are going to take care of their customers," he said. "They 
may let you be their employer and bring their customers to you, but if you don't want to pay them like they want to 
be paid -- and if you can't assure them that they will have the products, service, and platform to take care of their 
customers -- they'll go across the street to your competitor." 
Mr. Taylor calls this next generation the "universal banker," and that fits squarely with the evolving terminology 
from financial supermarket to universal bank. The practical strategy is the same: Sell more products to more 
customers. Synergy and cross-selling are alive and well, and the Big Five -- as well as the banking companies 
trying to stick with them -- are committed to the notion that the whole of a broad product suite and a wide 
customer base is greater than the sum of their component parts. 
The straight consolidation plays of the past remain in force. Bankers will slap two operations together and take 
out expenses, while occasionally promising -- and less frequently delivering -- revenue gains. But the deals that 
bankers find most attractive may be as much about expanding product capability as expanding geography. 
"I think we will have to do another merger of equals," Mr. Allison said. It "might be with a bank with a similar 
market cap, or it might be with an insurance company -- or it might be an investment bank." 
Such a deal may not be imminent, he said, but he expects the opportunity to arise over the next decade. It is a 
possibility that all the banking companies not assured of survival must consider. 
"Having a strong diversified mix of businesses and proving out the concept of universal banking is one potentially 
winning endgame view," said John Colas, who heads North American corporate strategy at Marsh & McLennan 
Cos.' Mercer Oliver Wyman. "It's not the only one, but it's the one that is available to the largest players." 
It's the one that Wachovia has followed, guided in part by the experience of companies like MBNA Corp., 
Providian -- and Golden West Financial Corp., which Wachovia is acquiring. 
"There is example after example of great companies that basically have made the decision that to continue their 
growth rate, they need more product, and they need more customers," said G. Kennedy Thompson, the 
chairman and CEO of Wachovia. "That's why I think universal banking is going to be the endgame player." 
Banking executives all opine about the eventual need for more product capacity. 
What will distinguish the companies is which businesses they decide are core -- and, of course, how well they run 
their businesses. Facing tough competition in all areas of financial services, executives have concluded that 
pretty good probably is not enough. 
"You need to be a leader," Mr. Harrison said. "You don't have to be No. 1 or No. 2, necessarily, but if you're No. 8, 
you're not going to have the operating dynamics to get the kind of growth and returns that you need." 
That is as much about geography as it is about products. 
"One premise that has not been proven, and I'm not a big believer in, is that you need to be a nationwide 
company to be a survivor," Mr. Daberko said. "But what you have to be is very strong and with good market 
shares in the markets that you choose to operate in geographically." 
As bankers make choices about businesses, the Citi/Nat City playbook will be standard: Announcements of 
divestitures will be made in concert with deals or ventures to supplement or expand the enterprise. Once again, 
it's about not just size and growth, but size and growth supplemented by a coherent vision. 
It is worth keeping in mind that executives at the largest banking companies tout the advantages of scale while 
acknowledging its diseconomies. Bureaucracies are necessary to manage large entities, but bureaucracies can 
kill the thrill of profit. 
Operational and reputational risk multiplies. Employees are less committed to a business when they cannot 
discern their influence on it. Good ideas are left unexplored for fear they will not make a material difference. Local 
businesses suffer from national management. Mediocrity is tolerated. Mistakes fester. Waste breeds. 
"There are diseconomies of scale," Mr. Harrison said. "When you are very big, you have to overcome 
bureaucracy, and increasing controls. If you're not careful, you may not be as innovative or as quick in responding 
to customers." 
Or to regulators, for that matter.

And markets do not value conglomerates, apparently. Large banking companies seek to get larger, but investors 
do not always embrace the result. Witness the regular calls for and speculation about breaking up Citi. 
Charles Prince, its CEO, continues to deride such talk as "silly." But it is interesting that the question even has 
currency at all. Sanford Weill's vision for the company was so clear and so absolute that few even bothered 
asking the breakup question when he was at the helm. 
Friday: Some companies scratching for survival are eschewing the universal model, and endgame competition is 
coming from outside the banking industry. Also, is there really any such thing as a national bank?

In Deal Defense, Wachovia CEO Provides (a Little) More Insight

In Deal Defense, Wachovia CEO Provides (a Little) More Insight

WASHINGTON -- Five weeks after unveiling his company's deal for Golden West Financial Corp., G. Kennedy 
Thompson, the chairman, chief executive, and president of Wachovia Corp., was forced to defend the deal again 
Wednesday. 
But this time Mr. Thompson said he is even more comfortable with the $25.5 billion deal now than he was when it 
was announced May 7, and he cited a comfort level with the integration process and an improved revenue 
outlook. 
It was clear that he has not quieted the critics entirely, but he managed to give them a glimpse into the planned 
integration during a conference call with investors moderated by Michael Mayo, a Prudential Equity Group LLC 
analyst. 
Mr. Thompson said a merger-integration team meeting he attended last week left him "thrilled to see the level of 
interplay" between the two companies. 
"We're going to do better from a revenue standpoint I think than we thought," Mr. Thompson said, due in part to 
Golden West's sales-oriented work force. "We like it more today than we did the day we announced it, and we 
liked it a lot then," he added. He did not give a dollar amount for revenue synergies. 
Wachovia executives have found themselves repeatedly defending the deal; the Charlotte company held two 
conference calls within a week after announcing it. 
Since the deal was unveiled Wachovia's stock has dropped 12%, because of concerns about Golden West's 
specialization in option adjustable-rate mortgages, the deal's high premium, and the perceived difficulty of turning 
the Oakland, Calif., thrift company into a cross-selling machine. 
Mr. Mayo, who lowered his rating for Wachovia's stock to "underweight," from "neutral weight," after the deal was 
announced, offered Mr. Thompson another opportunity to defend it. 
At times Mr. Thompson seemed to take umbrage at having to defend the deal again. He said investors are 
overlooking the quality of Golden West and its track record and the opportunities the companies would have to 
cross-sell mortgage products. 
"The last thing that the market has absolutely wrong is our ability to implement our retail banking model," he said. 
"I've got tremendous confidence in our ability to do that," he added. 
Wachovia has projected that the Golden West acquisition would be neutral to operating earnings in 2009, add a 
penny a share to cash earnings in 2008, and generate $53 million of after-tax cost savings and $293 million of 
merger-related expenses. Wachovia expects to close 55 branches and cut 1,100 jobs. 
Wednesday's call had some tense exchanges between the typically reserved Mr. Thompson and some Prudential 
clients. When asked about the difficulties of converting a large thrift company, he quickly described the question 
as the one "that frustrates me more than any other." 
Mr. Thompson went on to say that his company had acquired 27 thrift companies over the past 15 years, and that 
about one-third of its deposits in Florida, where he had once been the market president, have come from such

Page 15 of 47 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
acquisitions. "Golden West is a thrift in name only, and you have to just put aside all of your preconceived 
notions about what a thrift is when you talk about Golden West," he added. 
But the next investor questioned that comment, and Mr. Thompson quickly clarified that the $128 billion-asset 
Golden West did not resemble the "traditional S&L," which had "lousy branch locations and no sales culture." 
However, he acknowledged that the product line is "thrift-like." 
Nancy Bush, an analyst at NAB Research LLC in Aiken, S.C., said that Wachovia had failed to adequately 
publicize the Prudential call, and that she found out about it only after the fact. 
In many ways the conference call was markedly different from Mr. Thompson's one-on-one with Mr. Mayo in June 
of last year. During that call, the talk revolved around theoretical dealmaking; Mr. Thompson characterized 
California as a long-term goal and said his company would likely enter that state through branch-building at some 
point over a five-year period. 
In March, Wachovia acquired Westcorp Inc. and WFS Financial Inc. of Irvine, Calif. Though the $542 billion-asset 
company picked up 19 branches in southern California through those deals, they were largely viewed as a way of 
beefing up its auto-finance operations. 
By comparison, Golden West has 285 branches, including 123 in California and others in high-growth markets 
such as Chicago, Denver, and Phoenix. 
On Wednesday, Mr. Thompson again contested the notion that the majority of Golden West's branches are in 
subpar locations. 
"They opened those branches in affluent areas in the West because the purpose of that branch system was to 
raise deposits to fund mortgage growth," he said. "As a result ... those branches are almost all in the kind of 
places where we would have had branches if we had had the ability to be in the West." 
During the call, Mr. Mayo asked Mr. Thompson to speculate again on future acquisitions -- specifically, what 
Wachovia's international operations would look like in five years. Mr. Thompson would not provide any 
projections, except to say that international acquisitions are "not on our windshield." Wachovia would take its time 
integrating Golden West and "will be out of the big deal business certainly for a significant amount of time." Last 
month he said the integration could last until 2008.

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--From its first contact with a representative of Golden West Financial Corp. (GDW), 
it took Wachovia Corp. (WB) just ten days to complete the largest acquisition in its history, according to a 
disclosure made on Thursday. 
The initial contact in the $26 billion deal happened in the evening of Thursday, April 27, when a Lehman Brothers 
representative contacted a Wachovia representative on behalf of Golden West "and inquired whether Wachovia 
might be interested in discussing a strategic transaction regarding Golden West," according to a filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Wachovia Chairman and Chief Executive G. Kennedy Thompson contacted the co-chief executives of Golden 
West, the husband-and-wife team of Herbert and Marion Sandler, "to indicate that Wachovia was familiar with 
Golden West and to express Wachovia's interest in pursuing a possible strategic transaction with Golden West," 
the filing said. 
The ensuing days were occupied with contacts between the two companies' representatives, and discussions 
among each company's executives, directors and advisers on matters related to the merger. On May 2, five days 
after the initial contact, Wachovia and Golden West entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements and 
began due-diligence investigations. 
On Friday, May 5, the two sides hammered out the major financial terms of the deal, reaching an agreement that 
Wachovia would pay the equivalent of 1.051 shares of Wachovia common stock and $18.65 in cash for each 
outstanding share of Golden West common stock. 
Each board of directors unanimously approved the deal on Sunday, May 7, and the deal was announced in a joint 
press release that evening. That evening, a wire report filed by The Wall Street Journal described the acquisition 
as Wachovia's largest ever.

Wachovia Corp. chairman, chief executive, and president G. Kennedy Thompson said it will likely make smaller 
bank acquisitions in California to build on the $25.5 billion deal for Golden West Financial Corp. 
Over time the $542 billion-asset Charlotte company will build branches in the state and "probably make some 
small acquisitions along the way," , Mr. Thompson, said Tuesday. 
He did not provide a specific timeline, though Wachovia has said it would not integrate Golden West's California 
branches until the fourth quarter of next year. 
Wachovia announced May 7 that it would acquire the $128 billion-asset Oakland thrift company. Golden West 
has 123 branches in California. Wachovia obtained 19 through its March acquisition of Westcorp in Irvine. 
The Golden West deal has elicited some skepticism on Wall Street over concerns that include the seller's focus 
on option adjustable-rate mortgages and Wachovia's ability to cross-sell to Golden West customers. Wachovia 
has been busy trying to clarify its reasons for pursuing the deal. "If you look at the way we've grown our East 
Coast franchise over time, we think it's a pretty good model," Mr. Thompson said Tuesday during a New York 
conference hosted by UBS AG. "We feel that we'll play very well on the West Coast with our brand of general 
banking."

What's Driving Latest Deals? (It's Not Costs)

WASHINGTON -- The recent pickup in big-bank deals has shone a light on an emerging trend: Buyers appear to 
be focusing more on revenue synergies. 
Take Wachovia Corp. During a conference call with investors Monday to discuss its $25.5 billion deal for the 
Oakland, Calif., thrift company Golden West Financial Corp., G. Kennedy Thompson, Wachovia's chairman, 
president, and chief executive, made only a brief reference to anticipated expense cuts. 
There are "almost no cost saves in the numbers," he said. 
Tom Wurtz, Wachovia's chief financial officer, outlined plans for "modest expense savings" of about 9% of the 
$125 billion-asset Golden West's cost base. 
Though Mr. Thompson conceded that the deal metrics contained "zero revenue synergies," he was quick to add 
that he feels "very, very confident that there will be significant revenue synergies" for his $541.8 billion-asset 
Charlotte company. The deal, announced May 7, is expected to close in the fourth quarter. 
During a conference call Friday, Mr. Wurtz outlined $230 million in revenues synergies in 2009, by expanding 
Wachovia's broader product set to Golden West customer, cross-sell option adjustable-rate mortgages to 
Wachovia customers. He said Golden West was "unique in the mortgage market." 
Gary L. Perlin, the chief financial officer of Capital One Financial Corp., was up front when he discussed the 
McLean, Va., credit card lender's agreement to purchase the $58 billion-asset North Fork Bancorp. Inc. of 
Melville, N.Y. 
"We expect revenue synergies of approximately $130 million," he said. 
About 40% of those synergies would come from cross-selling North Fork's mortgage offerings to customers of 
Capital One and Hibernia Corp., the New Orleans banking company it acquired November. About 40% would 
come from selling Capital One's cards to North Fork customers, and about 10% would come from cross-selling 
opportunities in small-business banking. 
The $14.6 billion deal, announced March 12, is expected to close in the fourth quarter. 
Though Mr. Perlin also outlined $110 million of cost cuts resulting from the deal, observers said there appear to 
be a change in mentality among acquiring companies. 
"Nobody is out there saying, 'Here is this big slash-and-burn cost cut that will make it work,' " Robert B. Albertson, 
the chief strategist at Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP said Tuesday in an interview. "That era may be ending." 
Investment bankers share this view. 
"I don't think anybody is looking to take out capacity," Andrew M. Senchak, a vice chairman and the president of 
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., said in an interview Wednesday. "This is more about, 'Can I expand?' "

Page 19 of 47 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Many observers said that desire for expansion also fueled JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s decision to swap its 
corporate trust business -- and $150 million in cash -- for Bank of New York Co. Inc.'s retail and middle-market 
banking business. 
"There is increasing evidence of the benefits of size and scale in terms of capital efficiency, marketing 
advantages, and cost structure," John Mahoney, a co-head of the U.S. bank group at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 
said in an interview Tuesday. 
Mr. Senchak and others said the focus on revenue also shows up in smaller recent acquisitions. 
Some of the regional bank deals may not have the "narrowly defined strategic rationale" of Wachovia and Capital 
One, but they are following the same broad trend of revenue growth, Richard A. Schaberg, a partner with the law 
firm Thacher Proffitt & Wood LLP, said in an interview Wednesday. "Your rank-and-file thrift or bank sale to yet 
another bank or thrift is more about ... let's just take that customer base and service it better, more lucratively." 
Two examples observers cited from last month are TD Banknorth Inc.'s $480.6 million deal to buy Interchange 
Financial Services Inc. of Saddle Brook, N.J., and the $55 million deal that $980 million-asset Alliance Financial 
Corp. in Syracuse, N.Y., announced April 24 to buy the $225 million-asset Bridge Street Financial Inc. of Oswego. 
The reasons to sell have not changed. 
"What we have seen and heard over the last two years: The economic reality of just how tough the operating 
environment is, is weighing very heavily on the small institutions," John Chrin, the head of financial institution 
mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase, said in an interview Tuesday. 
Pressure on revenue from the continually slowing mortgage business, and pressure on loan spreads from the flat 
yield curve, are cited most often as reasons to look for a buyer. Slower deposit growth makes it harder -- and 
more expensive -- for some to fund loan growth, and worsening credit quality later this year may well require 
many bankers to increase reserves to cover loan losses. 
"The cost of regulation, the cost of computerization, the cost of marketing is just driving a lot of the smaller banks 
to want to find a sizable partner like us," William J. Ryan, the $40.9 billion-asset TD Banknorth's chairman and 
CEO, told American Banker in an interview April 13, just after his Portland, Maine, company announced its deal to 
buy the $1.6 billion-asset Interchange. 
The deal would provide TD Banknorth with ample cost savings, Mr. Ryan said, but his company would expand 
Interchange's offerings, particularly in insurance products and wealth management services. 
Even the decisions by Herbert and Marion Sandler, the co-founders and co-CEOs of Golden West, and John A. 
Kanas, the chairman and CEO of North Fork, to sell their companies reflect the desire to increase revenue rather 
than a simple response to competition. 
"Our great strength is our focus and our discipline," said Mr. Sandler during the conference call announcing 
Golden West's deal to sell itself to Wachovia. "But the negative is that we are, in fact, a monoline company. ... 
You can just go so far as a one product company." 
Golden West found its match in Wachovia's dedication to service and its broad product array, he said. 
Mr. Kanas told American Banker in an interview March 13, a day after the Capital One deal was announced, that 
the card lender would provide "the asset generator" that North Fork needs to withstand an inverted yield curve. 
Many analysts and investment bankers said both companies had years to go before hitting an earnings wall. 
"Neither one is really indicating that they couldn't go alone. It is just a question of the greater value and growth 
potential," Mr. Albertson said. 
Observers said the sellers met the revenue expectations of the buyers. 
"Both Kanas and the Sandlers are smart operators," one investment banker said. "I don't think that it is totally 
random that they chose now to sell." 
And the fact that neither had to sell makes predictions about who could follow their lead particularly difficult, 
investment bankers said.

Page 20 of 47 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Kenneth Bruce, a Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. analyst, wrote in a report issued last week that investors may now look 
at Washington Mutual Inc. and Countrywide Financial Corp. as potential targets. 
Countrywide, by all accounts a formidable mortgage originator, is narrowly focused and lacks branches. But 
David Hendler, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., wrote in a report issued Thursday that Countrywide is an unlikely 
seller. 
Analysts and investment bankers also disagree on whether Wamu is more likely to buy or sell. Several 
investment bankers said the $348.7 billion-asset Seattle thrift company could be a long-term survivor, especially if 
it chooses its targets well. 
Last year Wamu bought the San Francisco credit card lender Providian Financial Corp., and last month it 
announced it would buy Commercial Capital Bancorp Inc. an Irvine, Calif., thrift company that specializes in 
multifamily lending. 
But the research team at Keefe Bruyette added the Seattle thrift company to its list of potential takeover targets 
on May 10. Wamu is "under-earning, in large part due to poor efficiency," the firm said in its report. "A merger 
could result in significant cost saves." 
One investment banker said that the $37.3 billion-asset First Horizon National Corp. may consider putting itself on 
the block. 
The large Memphis mortgage lender, which has sizable exposure to capital markets, issued a messy first-quarter 
report. The company may provide a buyer with an attractive entry into the fast-growing southern banking markets. 
Observers are divided on whether the current pace of deal-making in financial services will continue. SNL 
Financial LC said that as of May 5, 173 bank, thrift, and specialty finance deals had been announced this year, 14 
more than in the same period last year. 
"We would caution investors" against concluding that the pace will pick up, Kevin S. Pierre, an analyst with 
AllianceBernstein LP's Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC, wrote in a report issued May 5. "We believe that at 
current bank valuations, it is quite difficult to find attractive deal pairs." 
Mr. Schaberg was more bullish. "What we are seeing is a fairly significant pickup in volume from 2005," he said. "I 
frankly don't see that tailing off." 
All of the investment bankers interviewed for this story, as well as Mr. Schaberg, advised on at least one of the 
deals mentioned in this story. Spokespeople for Countrywide, Wamu, and First Horizon declined to comment.

Wachovia in California: Street Assays Prospects

Wachovia in California: Street Assays Prospects

WASHINGTON -- Wachovia Corp.'s deal to buy Golden West Financial Corp. may send ripples through the 
California banking market, but it would not make the Charlotte banking company a heavyweight in the state 
overnight, observers say. 
To become a household name there, the $542 billion-asset Wachovia needs to remake Golden West in its own 
image and cross-sell its far wider product set to the Oakland, Calif., thrift company's customers. 
"They can be competitive in California if they are willing to spend the money to make the changes," said Gary 
Townsend, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc. in Arlington, Va. 
The $25.5 billion deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, would make Wachovia the sixth-biggest depository 
institution in the state, according to June 31, 2005, data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (At the end of 
June it was the 32nd-biggest.) 
However, Wachovia would still trail companies like Bank of America Corp., Washington Mutual Inc., and Wells 
Fargo & Co., the top three deposit holders in California, which held a combined share of 50% at midyear. 
Acquiring Golden West would give Wachovia an extensive network of branches, including 123 in California. It 
would also become one of the country's largest option adjustable-rate mortgage lenders. 
"Everyone would have to say ... [Golden West] is the best option ARM lender out there," Fred Cannon of Keefe, 
Bruyette & Woods Inc., said in an interview Monday. 
But demand is slowing for Golden West's single mortgage product in the current interest rate environment. 
Observers said Wachovia would likely be able to adjust to the slowdown, because it could offer customers of 
Golden West's World Savings Bank other mortgage products, including fixed-rate loans. However, Mr. Townsend 
and others said that World Savings' branches are not in the greatest shape, or in prime locations. Also, the 
branches are populated by workers who do not cross-sell, and they are frequented by older customers who do 
not want automated teller machines, observers say. 
In announcing the deal Sunday, Wachovia said it would spend $34 million to upgrade things like branches and 
systems. It would put its name on the California branches in the fourth quarter of next year. 
During a conference call held Monday to discuss the deal, Wachovia chairman, president, and chief executive G. 
Kennedy Thompson, said that before that conversion his company would train Golden West employees and 
hire financial specialists, "so that on the day of conversion, when the name becomes Wachovia and the systems 
change, we will have a branch that will be operating with the new product set, and we will also have taken steps 
to make sure that every customer of that branch is contacted and knows exactly what is going on." 
On Thursday, the company did not comment by press time. 
Peter Kelly, a co-leader of the banking practice in the Los Angeles office of the executive recruiting firm Highland 
Partners, a unit of Hudson Highland Group Inc., said Golden West "gives them the opportunity, I suspect, with 
the large number of branches, to leverage their other lines of business."

Wachovia already has 4,500 employees, or 4.5% of its work force, in California in several business lines, 
including Wachovia Securities and Wachovia Small Business Capital. In February it acquired the Irvine banking 
company Westcorp and WFS Financial Inc., an auto-finance company that was 84% owned by Westcorp. 
But Wachovia would have a lot of catching up to do. 
"We are in this endgame in California. We have three big franchises out here -- B of A, Wells Fargo and Wamu -- 
that are very entrenched," Mr. Cannon said. The question for other big banking companies, such as Citigroup 
Inc., U.S. Bancorp, and Wachovia, is "Can someone develop a fourth meaningful player in the market -- or get to 
the size where they are clearly a national player that can vie with the Big Three in California?" 
Analysts say Citi has not capitalized on its 2002 purchase of Golden State Bancorp, the parent of California 
Federal Bank. That purchase gave the $1.6 trillion-asset New York company 336 branches in California. Today it 
has 373 in the state, and at the end of June it had the No. 5 deposit share, according to the FDIC. 
Wachovia would be a better retail competitor than Citi, analysts say. (Last year Wachovia led retail banking 
companies in the University of Michigan's American Customer Satisfaction Index for the fifth straight year.) 
Wamu has demonstrated that acquisitions, combined with the right product, free checking, and clever marketing, 
can pay off in the Golden State. The Seattle thrift company's first major thrust in California came in 1996-98. In 
that three-year period it bought the $20 billion-asset American Savings Bank of Irvine, which had 125 branches; 
the $43 billion-asset Great Western Financial Corp., which had 416 branches in California and Florida; and H.F. 
Ahmanson & Co., the parent of the 335-branch Home Savings of America. 
At an investor conference Tuesday in Seattle, Steve Rotella, the chief operating officer of the $349 billion-asset 
Wamu, welcomed Wachovia's expansion plans. "We obviously have a very large presence in terms of retail 
stores and mortgage banking operations, and we think we'll continue to succeed very nicely in California with 
Wachovia in the marketplace." 
The $1.38-trillion asset B of A is also firmly entrenched in California. In 1998 the Charlotte company bought 
BankAmerica Corp., which was founded in San Francisco in 1904. 
Analysts said they do not think that executives at Wells are huddled in its San Francisco headquarters a panic 
right now. 
"I don't think people are getting their heads together at Wells and saying, 'Oh, what are we going to do? Are we 
going to change?' " Joe Morford of Royal Bank of Canada's RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco, said Tuesday. 
"They are still the hometown bank here -- bigger footprint across the state, well known, good brand identity, 
everybody knows their stagecoach here, good market share, their people are entrenched." 
But Richard X. Bove of Punk, Ziegel & Co., said he believes Wachovia's expansion on the West Coast could have 
two significant ripple effects on the merger and acquisition front: making Wamu a more likely takeover target and 
forcing the $492-billion Wells to finally seek to expand in the east. 
"There are six companies now sitting on the West Coast that have national or international franchises, and Wells 
doesn't. That puts the company at a significant competitive disadvantage," he said. 
A spokeswoman for Wells said it would not comment for this story. Wamu would not discuss takeover 
speculation. 
During an investor conference Tuesday, Bruce L. Helsel, a senior executive vice president and head of corporate 
development at Wells, repeated its attitude about deals. "We really don't need to do acquisitions to increase our 
distribution network," he said.

Two top Wachovia Corp. executives sold shares of the bank valued at $5.8 million around the same time that it 
began talks to buy Golden West Financial Corp. 
Wachovia said the executives, Benjamin Jenkins III, Wachovia's vice chairman and head of consumer banking, 
and investor-relations chief Alice Lehman, weren't aware of the discussions when they sold the shares April 27 
and 28. 
Mr. Jenkins sold 11,767 shares at prices of $58.39 to $59.89; the purchase price of those shares couldn't be 
determined. He also exercised 25,200 stock options for a gain of as much as $409,336, on shares sold at $56.37 
apiece, according to regulatory filings. 
Ms. Lehman exercised options on 62,000 shares for a gain of as much as $1.3 million, a regulatory filing shows. 
On Tuesday, Wachovia said its chairman and chief executive, G. Kennedy Thompson, received a telephone call 
about Golden West late on April 27 that led to the $23.95 billion deal announced late Sunday night. Initially, Mr. 
Thompson told analysts and investors in a conference call Monday that Wachovia and Golden West had "been 
talking for several weeks." In an interview Monday, Mr. Thompson said he was first contacted about his interest in 
the Oakland, California, savings and loan about three weeks earlier. 
None of the company's references to the timing of the takeover talks are inconsistent, Wachovia spokeswoman 
Mary Eshet said. Mr. Thompson was "speaking in general and as a very general term," she added. 
Wachovia said the stock sales were consistent with its internal policies and procedures for executives who buy or 
sell company stock. "We are aware of these transactions, and the executives complied with our procedures," the 
bank said in a statement. 
The exact sequence of events culminating with the acquisition agreement will be disclosed in a proxy filing before 
the deal closes, expected for the fourth quarter. 
Many companies implement blackout periods barring executives from selling shares before corporate moves that 
might significantly affect the company's stock price. Wachovia declined to discuss whether it imposes such 
restrictions during takeover talks. 
Robert Fields, a New York executive-compensation lawyer, said Wachovia's internal rules likely are so strong that 
Mr. Jenkins and Ms. Lehman didn't run afoul of securities laws barring executives from buying or selling shares 
while in possession of material information that hasn't been made public. Still, "appearances are something else," 
Mr. Fields said. 
Wachovia shares hit a 52-week high of $60.04 on April 28. Tuesday, they fell 81 cents, or 1.5%, to $54.61 in 4 
p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Yesterday afternoon, the stock was up 69 cents, or 
1.3%, to $55.30.

Two top Wachovia Corp. executives sold shares of the bank valued at $5.8-million around the same time that it

Wachovia said the executives, Benjamin P. Jenkins III, Wachovia's vice chairman and head of consumer banking,

27 and 28. 
Mr. Jenkins sold 36,967 shares for $2.1-million (U.S.), at $56.37 to $59.89 each. He got 25,200 of the shares by 
exercising options priced at $40.13 a share, resulting in a gain of $409,336. He also sold an additional 11,767 
shares for $58.39 to $59.89 a share, according to regulatory filings. 
The purchase price of those shares couldn't be determined. 
Ms. Lehman sold 62,000 shares for $59.50 each, or a total of $3.7-million. She got those shares by exercising

Wachovia takes third stake in California with Golden West

Wachovia takes third stake in California with Golden West

WACHOVIA, the fourth- biggest bank in the United States, has continued its onslaught on California by agreeing 
the $25.5 billion (Pounds 13.7 billion) takeover of Golden West, the mortgage provider. 
The acquisition would be Wachovia's third in California since December, when the bank bought AmNet Mortgage, 
a San Diego-based lender with a network of 7,000 mortgage brokers. That takeover came after Wachovia's 
acquisition of Westcorp, California's thirdbiggest 
lender to used car purchases, in March. 
Wachovia, which previously had a minimal presence in California, is keen to tap the potential of America's most 
populous state. California's 34 million population is forecast to grow at 7.7 per cent a year over the next five 
years, according to Wachovia. This compares with an average of 6.3 per cent for the country as a whole over the 
same period. 
Golden West, which has its headquarters in Oakland, is best known for its World Savings brand, which is the 
sixth-biggest mortgage lender in the state. 
The bank also operates 285 savings branches, 123 of them in California, which have $62 billion of deposits 
between them. The rest of the deposits are held in branches in Florida, Colorado, Texas, Arizona, New Jersey, 
Kansas, Illinois, Nevada and New York. 
Wachovia's strategy of moving into California by buying local operations echoes the approach that the bank has 
taken nationwide in recent years. Wachovia, led by Kennedy Thompson, its chief executive, has quadrupled 
profits since the end of 2001. The acquisition spree began with First Union's takeover of Wachovia, in which the 
First Union name was dropped, and continued with the acquisition of SouthTrust Corp in 2004. Wachovia will still 
be America's fourth-biggest bank after the deal, with $669 billion of assets and customers in 21 states. 
The deal would value the stake of Herbert and Marion Sandler, the husband and wife who founded Golden West 
in 1963, at nearly $5 billion. The couple, now in their seventies, are expected to hold on to their shares after the 
deal, although the cash component will 
give them a windfall worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
The combined company would still rank well behind JPMorgan Chase, America's third-biggest bank, but further 
ahead of Wells Fargo, the fifth. Citigroup is the biggest bank in the US, and the world, followed by Bank of 
America. 
Merrill Lynch and Wachovia itself advised Wachovia 
on the deal, along with Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm. Lehman Brothers and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz 
advised Golden West. 
Wachovia is buying Golden West for 16.8 times the company's profits for last year. 
This compares with the 15.4 times that Capital One Financial is paying for North Fork Bancorp.

Leading the News: Wachovia defends $24.21 billion acquisition --- Analysts, investors fret over hefty price 
for Golden West bank

Wachovia Corp. defended its $24.21 billion deal to purchase Golden West Financial Corp., insisting that the 
takeover will help catapult the North Carolina bank into a nationwide consumer-banking giant without derailing 
either company's profit growth. 
"The deals that we have done . . . have been extraordinarily good deals for our shareholders," Wachovia 
Chairman and Chief Executive G. Kennedy Thompson said in a conference call. "This one is going to be a 
crown jewel." 
Wachovia's takeover of Golden West, based in Oakland, California, is the second-largest acquisition struck in the 
U.S. so far this year. Buying Golden West would bring Wachovia an additional 285 branches in California, where 
it bought a handful of branches in March, and make Wachovia the sixth-largest deposit taker in the 
most-populous U.S. state. Wachovia also would get Golden West's highly regarded adjustable-rate-mortgage 
operation with offices in 39 of the 50 U.S. states. 
While analysts generally said the deal makes strategic sense for Wachovia as it tries to emerge from the 
consolidation wave in the U.S. banking industry as one of a small number of coast-to-coast players, some 
questioned the whopping price tag. Jon Balkind, an analyst at the Fox-Pitt, Kelton unit of Swiss Reinsurance Co., 
wrote in a research note that the deal is "richly priced" given Golden West's dependence on mortgage loans 
amid the fading real-estate boom in the U.S. 
Wachovia shares fell $4, or 6.7%, to $55.39 in afternoon composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange 
composite trading. That erased more than $1 billion from the initial value of the acquisition. Golden West rose 
$4.48, or 6.2%, to $74.89. 
Wall Street's skeptical reaction to the takeover partly reflects concern that Golden West could lose the magic 
formula that churned out predictably impressive profit growth and made the company so appealing to Wachovia. 
Golden West has been steered for more than 40 years by the husband-and-wife team of Herbert Sandler and 
Marion Sandler, who are co-chief executive officers but aren't expected to remain for long after the deal closes in 
this year's fourth quarter. "They have run the company like owners, rather than managers," said Fred Cannon, an 
analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. in San Francisco. 
The Sandlers had no formal employment agreements with Golden West, instead holding shares valued at more 
than $2 billion. Unlike top executives at other banks involved in recently announced deals, the Sandlers receive 
no additional compensation as a result of a change in control, Mr. Sandler said in an interview. 
Mr. Sandler dismissed questions about how well Golden West will do without him and his wife in control. "That's 
a bunch of garbage," he said in response to worries about the company's heavy exposure to option 
adjustable-rate mortgages, which let customers choose how much to pay each month, with unpaid interest added 
onto the mortgage and increasing the loan's balance. 
Some analysts predicted Wachovia will have to spend heavily to upgrade Golden West's branch network, which 
has relied mostly on high interest rates paid for certificates of deposit. In contrast, Wachovia has increasingly 
emphasized cross-selling of a variety of products in its 3,100 retail branches.

Risky Step or Measured One? Taking an Oath

Risky Step or Measured One? Taking an Oath

Another measured step in Wachovia Corp.'s expansion or a step too far? 
That was the question analysts seemed to wrestle with on Monday in the wake of Wachovia's $25.5 billion deal 
for Golden West Financial Corp. 
In size terms, Golden West is in a different category from the bank deals undertaken by CEO, president, and 
chairman G. Kennedy Thompson. It is nearly double in size the $14 billion acquisition First Union Corp. struck 
for Wachovia before taking its name. 
Several analysts downgraded the Charlotte company's shares Monday, citing concerns about the operational risk 
presented by Golden West's option adjustable-rate mortgage operations. 
However, others said that the deal was emblematic of Mr. Thompson's systematic and disciplined approach to 
acquisitions, with one referring to the deal as evidence of the executive's practice of "keeping promises" -- in this 
case pledges to expand in consumer lending and in California. 
In an interview Monday, Mr. Thompson said he found the reaction of some analysts "a little bit frustrating." Option 
ARMs "obviously have a bad name, but Golden West has the most conservative product out there." 
During a conference call earlier in the day with analysts, Mr. Thompson had briefly addressed concerns about 
Golden West's upcoming transformation. 
"Here is my promise to you," he said. "Like the Hippocratic oath, we will do nothing to screw up that model. We 
will only add to it." 
During the call Mr. Thompson presented the deal as a continuation of a growth plan well under way at his $542 
billion-asset company. 
The deal "rapidly increases the California growth plan that we had in place" and "bulks up and accelerates our 
growth plans in Texas," he said. 
Wachovia, which has also been vocal about its desire to focus on consumer banking and began reissuing its own 
cards this year, has been expanding in California, where it has completed two consumer transactions in the past 
six months. 
In December, Mr. Thompson said, "I believe that the consumer for the rest of my life is going to be a pretty good 
place to place your bet." That month his company acquired the San Diego home lender AmNet Mortgage Inc. for 
$83 million. In March, Wachovia acquired Westcorp Inc. of Irvine, Calif., and WFS Financial Inc., an auto finance 
company mostly owned by Westcorp, for $3.9 billion. 
The deal for Golden West, the parent of World Savings Bank, is expected to close in the fourth quarter. 
Wachovia would become a top five banking company in the West while gaining significant scale in the mortgage 
business. 
Golden West has $128 billion of assets and 285 branches, including 123 in California, where Wachovia gained 
19 branches through its purchase of Westcorp.

Page 32 of 47 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Buying Golden West would expand Wachovia's operations in Florida and Texas and bring it into to Colorado and 
Arizona. 
During the call, Mr. Thompson said buying Golden West would make Wachovia one of the six largest banking 
companies in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, Houston, and Phoenix. Wachovia's asset total would rise to 
$686 billion, still the nation's fourth-biggest. (The top three banking companies have more than $1 trillion.) 
Mr. Thompson called Golden West a "crown jewel" that his company had long "admired," but one that "we just 
never thought we would ever have a chance to do a combination with." During the conference call, he said he 
was "thrilled" to be approached by Golden West's representatives. 
(A Wachovia spokeswoman would not discuss a report Monday in The Charlotte Observer that said Golden West 
started negotiating with Wachovia after unsuccessful discussions with Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings PLC. 
Spokesmen for Citi and HSBC also would not discuss the report.) 
Some analysts said they were surprised at the deal. 
Kevin Fitzsimmons, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP, said in an interview that the size and scale 
caught investors by surprise in a way that creates "a disconnect" from recent acquisitions. 
Michael Mayo, an analyst at Prudential Equity Group LLC, lowered his rating for Wachovia's stock to 
"underweight," from "neutral weight," and wrote in a note to clients that the deal presents three main issues: high 
operational risk, dilution of Wachovia's long-term growth rate, and terms that were "not cheap." 
Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at Royal Bank of Canada's RBC Capital Markets, said the biggest issue is whether 
Wachovia can transform Golden West without taking a major hit to earnings growth. 
"When you transition from a one-product model to a multiproduct model, you are going to lose some earnings 
growth," he said in an interview. "The deal appears to be measured, but the real question is will it be successful?" 
However, Robert Patten, an analyst at Regions Financial Corp.'s Morgan Keegan & Co. Inc., wrote in a report that 
Wachovia "has been in the business of making and keeping promises" and clearly communicated to investors a 
desire to build scale in auto lending, credit cards, and mortgages. He maintained an "outperform" rating for 
Wachovia stock. 
Wachovia projects that the Golden West acquisition would be neutral to operating earnings in 2009, add a penny 
a share to cash earnings in 2008, and generate $53 million of after-tax cost savings and $293 million of 
merger-related expenses. The company also plans to upgrade Golden West branches; few of them have 
automated teller machines, and many of them lack drive-throughs. Wachovia would add two Golden West 
directors to its board. The deal includes a $995 million breakup fee. 
During the conference call, Thomas J. Wurtz, Wachovia's chief financial officer, said the company could save 
more money by decelerating its branch-building. Wachovia executives have said in recent months that it could 
open 200 branches in California over the next five years, and that it could continue to open 50 branches a year in 
Texas. 
The deal "does represent an opportunity to step back, take a little breather, do that a little slower," Mr. Wurtz said. 
As with its other large acquisitions under Mr. Thompson, Wachovia would take its time integrating Golden West. 
He said during the call that it would likely wait until the fourth quarter of next year before taking on the California 
branches and even longer to integrate the remaining branches. 
Wachovia expects to close 55 branches and cut 1,100 jobs, including 225 to 250 resulting from the branch 
closings. Executives said it does not anticipate many cuts among employees who deal with the public. 
Herb Sandler, a co-chief executive of Golden West, said during the conference call that the company he 
co-founded with his wife, Marion, could have doubled in size as a stand-alone. 
"We operate in a very narrow niche, and we do it extraordinarily well," he said. "But the negative is that we are, in 
fact, a monoline company. ... You can just go so far as a one-product company."

WACHOVIA CORP. SAID it decided to pay $24.22 billion to buy Golden West Financial Corp. because of the 
savings and loan's obsessive devotion to adjustable-rate mortgages and old-fashioned reliance on raking in 
deposits. But it could be hard to preserve that magic formula after Wachovia takes over. 
The deal, announced late Sunday night, is the second-largest acquisition struck in the U.S. so far this year and by 
far the biggest ever for Wachovia, which has made an aggressive move to establish itself as one of a small 
number of coast-to-coast players likely to emerge from the consolidation wave in the U.S. banking industry. (The 
biggest deal this year is AT&T Inc.'s planned $72.67 billion takeover of BellSouth Corp.) 
Based on stock-market values as of yesterday, the combined company would have a total market capitalization of 
about $113.23 billion, with Wachovia remaining the fifth-largest bank in the U.S. but within striking distance of 
Wells Fargo &Co., which has a market value of $114.36 billion. 
Many investors and analysts were spooked yesterday by the 14% premium Wachovia agreed to pay for the 
Oakland, Calif., company given the dramatic differences in the history, culture and strategy of the two companies. 
"The good news is they're buying a great company," said Thomas Brown of Second Curve Capital LLC, a New 
York hedge fund. "The bad news is they're buying a company that runs a completely different business model." 
As a result, Wachovia shares fell $3.97, or 6.7%, to $55.42 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite 
trading. That was the stock's steepest one-day percentage decline since October 2002, when many banks 
tumbled on investors' worries about possible loan losses and reduced profits. Yesterday's decline erased about 
$1.28 billion from the initial value of the acquisition. Golden West rose $4.39, or 6.2%, to $74.90, also on the 
NYSE. 
Speculation about possible future takeovers fueled gains in shares of other lenders with a major presence in 
California. Downey Financial Corp. rose $4.02, or 5.6%, to $75.56, while Washington Mutual Inc. was up 83 
cents, or 1.8%, to $46.33. 
In many ways, Golden West is a supersize version of the homespun S&L depicted in the classic 1946 movie "It's 
a Wonderful Life." Golden West's 285 branches in 10 states are used primarily to attract high-yielding deposits 
from an older customer base. The deposits are funneled into mortgages, mostly option adjustable-rate 
mortgages, in which customers choose how much to pay each month, with unpaid interest added onto the 
mortgage. 
In contrast, Wachovia pays far skimpier interest rates on deposits and pushes its branch employees to sell 
customers numerous products. In addition to 3,100 branches, concentrated most heavily in the Southeast, the 
Charlotte, N.C., company has nearly 5,200 automated-teller machines, compared with only a handful at Golden 
West, which also eschews drive-through windows and other conveniences common at commercial banks. 
It remains to be seen whether Wachovia Chairman and Chief Executive G. Kennedy Thompson can turn 
Golden West branches into sales machines while preserving the company's successful track record in ARMs. 
"This is a grand slam home run for us," he said in an interview.

Herbert Sandler, who took over Golden West in 1963 with his wife Marion Sandler and is co-chief executive with 
her, curtly dismissed as "stupid" any worries that the two companies are incompatible. "It has nothing to do with 
what any of us do," he said in an interview. 
Mr. Thompson, who during six years in the top job at Wachovia largely has erased Wachovia's reputation for 
foolhardy acquisitions and lackluster customer service, has to prove that the impressive run of profit growth at 
Golden West won't end despite the cooling housing market. Golden West is heavily exposed to California, which 
is regarded as one of the most overheated real-estate markets in the U.S. 
Wachovia, which quit making mortgage loans in 2001 but has been tiptoeing back into that business, said it would 
keep the companies' mortgage operations separate for an unspecified period after the deal closes in the fourth 
quarter. 
Under the terms of the transaction, Mr. and Mrs. Sandler stand to receive stock and cash valued at $2.43 billion 
based on Wachovia's closing price yesterday of $55.42; that number would have been $2.56 billion based on 
Friday's close. They were pressed by Mr. Thompson, 55 years old, to sign employment agreements that would 
have kept them at Wachovia, but the couple declined. Mr. Sandler, 74, said he would help Wachovia executives 
for as long as needed. Russell Kettell, Golden West's president and chief financial officer, plans to join 
Wachovia, Mr. Thompson said. 
Golden West's management team is renowned for its painstaking attention to detail, risk-averse lending 
philosophy and relentless penny-pinching that has pushed expenses down to about 30 cents for every $1 in 
revenue, compared to more than double that at Wachovia. 
While Golden West long has been coveted by other banks, Mr. Sandler said he was quickly won over by Mr. 
Thompson, who often answers his own phone and sends handwritten thank-you notes to Wachovia colleagues. 
Golden West approached Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings PLC about a deal but those banks had no interest, 
according to a person familiar with the situation. 
Until about three weeks ago, Mr. Thompson had met the Sandlers only "on the pages of a magazine," he said, 
but flew to meet them after being approached by an intermediary. They bonded over sandwiches at the Park 
Hyatt hotel in San Francisco, with Mr. Thompson marveling at how the husband-and-wife co-CEOs finished each 
other's sentences. "You could see how they've managed that company for so many years," he said.

NEW YORK -- In the battle for dominance in the eat-or-be-eaten U.S. financial services market, Wachovia Corp., 
of Charlotte, N.C., has displayed a voracious aggressiveness that has transformed it into a national powerhouse 
and left would-be competitors in its wake. 
But some analysts yesterday questioned Wachovia's proposed $25.5-billion (U.S.) acquisition of California-based 
Golden West Financial Corp., suggesting the North Carolina bank may be in for a bout of indigestion. 
Through a lengthy string of acquisitions, Wachovia has succeeded with a bold growth strategy while other 
regional players, including foreigners such as Royal Bank of Canada and Royal Bank of Scotland, have been 
unable to stitch together disparate assets into a efficient network. 
From a sleepy regional deposit-taker 15 years ago, Wachovia has grown into the fourth-largest U.S. bank, with a 
branch network focused in eastern states and a national brokerage business. 
Chairman Kennedy Thompson said yesterday the deal with Golden West would greatly expand Wachovia's 
presence in the largest and fastest growing markets in the United States, and deepen its product line with access 
to Golden West's strength in the adjustable rate mortgage market. 
We think that this combination is both strategically and financially compelling for shareholders, Mr. Thompson 
said yesterday. In addition to accelerating our expansion plans  and we were very interested in getting into 
some of these Western markets  it also diversifies our balance sheet into higher yielding, lower risk consumer 
assets. 
The combined company will be the largest bank in the Southeastern United States, in the top five in the Western 
U.S. and in the top 10 nationally in mortgages and indirect auto loans. 
Golden West, of Oakland, Calif., is controlled by Herbert and Marion Sandler, the husband-and-wife team that 
founded the savings and loan company 39 years ago and led it through unmatched growth in the industry. It now 
has 285 savings branches in 10 states, lending operations in 39 states and is a national leader in the adjustable 
rate mortgage market. 
Mr. Sandler said he is confident that Golden West will deliver loyal customers to Wachovia, and that those 
customers will be benefit from the merged company's broader product line. 
Wall Street analysts and investors didn't share his enthusiasm. 
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Wachovia shares fell $3.97  or 6.6 per cent  to 
$55.42, amid concerns that Mr. Thompson paid too much for a mortgage-lender at a time when many analysts 
believe the housing market is slowing down. 
Golden West shares, by contrast, rose $4.39 or 6.2 per cent to close at $74.90. 
Gary Townsend, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Inc. was one of several analysts to downgrade 
Wachovia stock  in his case from outperform to perform in line with the market.

Page 37 of 47 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Wachovia may present the acquisition as strategic, but we find it difficult to find the strategic imperative for 
acquiring single-line mortgage company, Mr. Townsend said in a report. 
He added that the Golden West branches will require significant investment to bring them up to the full-service 
status that Wachovia boasts in its network. Many of them, he said, do not even have automatic teller machines. 
Jennifer Thompson, analyst of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., said the deal is strategically sound [and] financially 
viable and that it meaningfully improves long-term franchise value. 
She cautioned, however, that Wachovia would face some short-term difficulties in hanging on to Golden West's 
price-sensitive customers, and worried that it is increasing its exposure to California's booming real estate market 
at a time when rising interest rates may begin to bite.

WACHOVIA CORP. struck a roughly $26 billion stock-and-cash deal to buy Golden West Financial Corp., 
making a big gamble on the volatile U.S. mortgage business as it extends its ambition to become a true national 
bank. 
Wachovia agreed to pay 1.051 shares of its stock, valued at $62.42 based on Friday's closing prices, plus $18.65 
in cash for each share of Golden West. The price represents a roughly 15% premium to Golden West's current 
market value. The deal was unveiled late Sunday, following final negotiations complicated by the fact that 
Wachovia executives were hosting a PGA golf tournament, the Wachovia Championship, in the bank's hometown 
of Charlotte, North Carolina. 
The deal furthers the rapid consolidation of the U.S. banking industry into a small number of national players, 
complemented by a coterie of small regional and community banks. Wachovia has been the most voracious of all, 
forging about 140 takeovers and mergers -- large and small -- that have transformed it from a sleepy Southern 
bank into a coast-to-coast financial-services giant. 
Golden West, based in Oakland, California, is the second-largest savings and loan in the U.S. behind 
Washington Mutual Inc., for decades steered by co-chief executive officers, husband-and-wife team Herb and 
Marion Sandler, now in their 70s. The deal marks Wachovia's largest acquisition by far, and is the eighth-largest 
banking deal in U.S. history, according to SNL Financial. With roots that extend back to 1912, Golden West has 
amassed total assets of about $127 billion, roughly one-quarter the size of Wachovia's $542 billion. Based on 
market values as of Friday, the combined company would have a total market capitalization of about $118 billion. 
Wachovia currently ranks fifth in the U.S. and 12th globally in market capitalization. 
In 4 p.m. composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Wachovia was up $1.01 to $59.39, while 
Golden West was up $1.82 to $70.51. Midday yesterday Wachovia was down 5.8% at $56.01; Golden West was 
up 7.6% at $75.90. 
The long-running boom in the nation's real-estate market has led to an impressive run of profitability at mortgage 
lenders like Golden West, whose shares were trading Friday near their high. But with recent signs of some 
softening in real estate, Wachovia investors are sure to be asking whether the sale is a sign that the Sandlers 
view the market as having topped out. While Golden West has a conservative track record for underwriting loans, 
increased competition could raise the risk that loans the company has provided will sour, leaving Wachovia to 
deal with the losses. 
If approved by shareholders and regulators, the combination of the two financial companies would establish 
banking pillars on both coasts of the U.S., as well as offices the two companies have in between in states such as 
Texas. Golden West will add about 10,000 employees to Wachovia's current employment level of about 97,000. 
Wachovia said it plans to cut less than 1% of the expense base of the combined companies, but added that no 
employees who deal directly with customers are likely to lose their jobs. The deal is expected to close in this 
year's fourth quarter. 
Buying Golden West will let Wachovia extend its brand name across 285 branches in 10 states, where Golden 
West flies the World Savings Bank banner. The deal will make Wachovia the sixth-largest deposit-taker in 
California, the most-populous U.S. state, though its market share of about 5% would trail far behind those of Bank 
of America Corp., Washington Mutual Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co., based on the latest Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. data. Wachovia said the deal would add to per-share profit, excluding expenses and amortization triggered 
by the acquisition, by the end of the second year after the purchase.

Page 39 of 47 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Golden West's primary appeal is its clout in adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, on residential properties, 
generated through offices in 39 U.S. states where Golden West drums up business from local real-estate agents, 
mortgage brokers and directly from consumers. Wachovia Chairman and CEO G. Kennedy Thompson has been 
pushing hard over the past year to beef up the bank's consumer-lending operation, complaining that its offerings 
have been weak. 
Wachovia's March takeover of Westcorp Inc. for $3.9 billion gave the bank a handful of branches in California. 
Last September the company bought San Diego lender AmNet Mortgage Inc. for $83 million, gaining that 
company's nationwide distribution network and relationships with mortgage brokers. 
Merrill Lynch & Co., Wachovia Securities and Sullivan & Cromwell represented Wachovia. Lehman Brothers 
Holdings Inc. and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz represented Golden West.

Wachovia Corp. is close to striking a roughly $30 billion deal to purchase Golden West Financial Corp., said 
people familiar with the matter, giving the nation's fourth-largest bank access to the last crown jewel among 
California banks. 
Details were still being worked out, and the deal may still fall apart, these people said. Preparations were delayed 
by a professional golf event being hosted by Wachovia yesterday in North Carolina. 
If sealed, a deal would vault Wachovia further up the rankings among U.S. banks and give it exposure to the 
population growth in the West. But it would be a large bet on the mortgage business, as Golden West is one of 
the nation's leading mortgage lenders. Golden West has total assets of about $127 billion, about one-quarter of 
Wachovia's $542 billion in assets. 
Golden West officials couldn't be reached for comment. Wachovia officials declined to comment. 
The price that G. Kennedy Thompson, chief executive of Wachovia, has agreed to pay will likely spark 
comparisons to his predecessor, Edward E. Crutchfield Jr., who was known as "Fast Eddie" for the buying spree 
he orchestrated during the time he ran in the bank from the 1970s to the late 1990s. 
When the bank announced Mr. Crutchfield had cancer in 2000, the deal maker turned the bank, then called First 
Union Corp., over to his handpicked protege, Mr. Thompson, who took careful steps to win back investors, such 
as shutting down Money Store Inc., a lender to people with poor credit histories that Wachovia purchased in 
1998. 
In 2001, Mr. Thompson went back on the acquisition trail when First Union acquired the former Wachovia Corp. 
for $14 billion. Mr. Thompson, however, soothed investor concern when he and his integration team combined the 
big banks while avoiding major customer disruptions.

Golden West's primary appeal is its clout in adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, on residential properties, 
generated through offices in 39 U.S. states where Golden West drums up business from local real-estate agents, 
mortgage brokers and directly from consumers. Wachovia Chairman and CEO G. Kennedy Thompson has been 
pushing hard over the past year to beef up the bank's consumer-lending operation, complaining that its offerings 
have been weak. 
The lending business has been good to Golden West, last year resulting in net profit margins of 44% on revenue 
of $3.4 billion. Investors have flocked to the company, pushing Golden West shares up 10% over the past year, 
and by more than three-and-a-half-fold since 2000. On Friday, the company's shares traded at about 14.4 times 
current earnings, according to data compiled by CapitalIQ. That placed it slightly above the average for U.S. 
thrifts, which trade at 14.1 times, and above rivals Washington Mutual (12.3 times) and Countrywide Financial 
Corp. (10.1 times). 
Nearly all of Golden West's loans are ARMs, most carrying interest rates that change monthly. Its most popular 
product is the option ARM, which lets customers choose how much to pay each month, with unpaid interest 
added onto the mortgage and increasing the loan's balance. While such loans have been controversial among 
investors, Golden West has said it is sufficiently insulated from risk because of its 25 years of experience with its 
version of the option ARM. 
Golden West says it favors loans on moderately priced houses because they tend to retain their value better than 
more-expensive property when the housing market weakens. That formula has worked so far: Golden West's 
ratio of charge-offs to total loans has been zero for eight consecutive years. 
Much of Golden West's steady growth even during real-estate slumps can be traced to Mr. and Mrs. Sandler, 
who took over the company in 1963. Mrs. Sandler had been one of the first female stock-market analysts, 
covering the savings-and-loan industry, while her husband was a lawyer for S&Ls. After moving to California, they 
agreed to split the CEO duties, with Mrs. Sandler focusing on customer service and Mr. Sandler on 
administration. Together, the Sandlers control or have the right to acquire 31 million Golden West shares valued 
at $2.19 billion. As of March, Mr. Sandler was 74 years old and Mrs. Sandler was 75, according to a securities 
filing. 
It wasn't immediately clear how much the Sandlers could walk away with as part of the deal. According to 
securities filings, Golden West adopted a new stock-incentive plan for officers and employees as of last year, 
under which vesting and exercise of stock options may accelerate upon a change in control. The Sandlers each 
had unexercised options valued at more than $29 million as of Dec. 31. 
Wachovia's Mr. Thompson has built a reputation as one of banking's most-acquisitive chieftains, and he has 
made no secret of his ambition to push Wachovia to ever greater national prominence. Nevertheless, the price 
that Mr. Thompson has agreed to pay for Golden West will likely spark comparisons to his predecessor, Edward 
E. Crutchfield Jr., known as "Fast Eddie" for the buying spree he orchestrated when he ran the bank from the 
1970s to the late 1990s. Many of the acquisitions were poorly handled, and customers fled in large numbers. In 
the 1990s, the bank repeatedly reduced earnings estimates, angering investors and losing their confidence. 
When Mr. Crutchfield was stricken with cancer, he turned over the bank, then called First Union Corp., to his 
hand-picked protege, Mr. Thompson. The successor then took careful steps to win back investors, such as 
shutting down Money Store Inc., a lender to people with poor credit histories that Wachovia had purchased in 
1998. 
In 2001, Mr. Thompson returned to the acquisition trail in a big way when First Union acquired the former 
Wachovia Corp. for $14 billion. Mr. Thompson soothed investor concern when he and his integration team, 
operating from a war room, combined the big banks while avoiding major customer disruptions. Mr. Thompson 
continued the deals in 2003 when Wachovia agreed to combine its brokerage force with Prudential Financial Inc., 
creating a venture called Wachovia Securities. The next year, Wachovia announced a $13.7 billion acquisition of 
SouthTrust Corp. of Alabama in a deal that led some investors and analysts to question whether Wachovia paid 
too much. 
Wachovia's March takeover of Westcorp Inc. for $3.9 billion gave the bank a handful of branches in California. 
Last September, the company bought San Diego lender AmNet Mortgage Inc. for $83 million, gaining that 
company's nationwide distribution network and relationships with mortgage brokers. Mr. Thompson has said 
Wachovia needs to be able to offer essentially every type of loan sought by bank customers. 
Wachovia has taken a hard look at most major financial-services companies sold in the past year. Wachovia 
considered buying credit-card giant MBNA Corp. last year but balked at the price. Bank of America, Wachovia's

hometown rival, ultimately bought MBNA for $34 billion. Wachovia also had talks with North Fork Bancorp, which 
was bought by Capital One Financial Corp. in March for $14.6 billion, and considered buying the Bank of New 
York branches bought last month for $3 billion by J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. 
Merrill Lynch, Wachovia Securities and Sullivan &Cromwell represented Wachovia. Lehman Brothers and 
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &Katz represented Golden West.

Wachovia Corp. is close to striking a roughly $26-billion (U.S.) stock-and-cash deal to buy Golden West Financial 
Corp., according to people familiar with the matter, pushing Wachovia deeper into the mortgage business while 
extending its ambitions to become a truly national banking player. 
Wachovia is expected to offer three-quarters stock and one-quarter cash to pay a roughly 20-per-cent takeover 
premium to Golden West, the nation's second-largest savings and loan. Barring a last-minute hitch, an 
announcement could come as early as this morning. Final negotiations were complicated by the fact that 
Wachovia executives were hosting a PGA golf tournament, the Wachovia Championship, in the bank's hometown 
of Charlotte, N.C. 
The deal would further the rapid consolidation of the banking industry toward a small number of national players, 
complemented by a coterie of small regional and community banks. Wachovia has been the most voracious of all, 
forging about 140 takeovers and mergers  large and small  that have transformed it from a sleepy Southern 
bank into a coast-to-coast financial-services giant. 
Golden West, based in Oakland, Calif., would be its largest acquisition by far, and would be the eighth-largest 
banking deal in U.S. history, according to SNL Financial. With roots that extend back to 1912, Golden West has 
amassed total assets of about $127-billion, about one-quarter the size of Wachovia's $542-billion. Based on 
market values as of Friday, the combined company would have a total market capitalization of about $118-billion. 
Wachovia currently ranks fifth in the United States and 12th globally in terms of market capitalization. 
The long-running boom in the nation's real-estate market has led to an impressive run of profitability at mortgage 
lenders like Golden West, whose shares were trading Friday near their all-time high. But with recent signs of 
some softening in real estate, Wachovia investors are sure to be asking whether the sale is a sign that Golden 
West's co-chief executive officers, husband-and-wife team Herb and Marion Sandler, view the market as having 
topped out. 
Buying Golden West would let Wachovia extend its brand name across 280 branches in 10 states, where 
Golden West currently flies the World Savings Bank banner. The deal would make Wachovia the sixth-largest 
depositor in California, the most-populous U.S. state, though its 4.3-per-cent market share would trail far behind 
those of Bank of America Corp., Washington Mutual Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co., based on the latest Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. data. The deal is expected to make positive contributions to Wachovia's earnings by 
2008. Golden West's primary appeal, though, is its clout in adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, on residential 
properties, generated through offices in 39 U.S. states where Golden West drums up business from local 
real-estate agents, mortgage brokers and directly from consumers. Wachovia chairman and CEO G. Kennedy 
Thompson has been pushing hard over the past year to beef up the bank's consumer-lending operation, 
complaining that its offerings have been weak. 
The lending business has been good to Golden West, last year resulting in profit margins of 44 per cent on 
revenue of $3.4-billion. Investors have flocked to the company, pushing Golden West shares up 10 per cent over 
the past year, and by more than three-and-a-half fold since 2000. On Friday, the company's shares traded at 
about 14.4 times current earnings, according to data compiled by CapitalIQ. That placed it slightly above the 
average for U.S. thrifts, which trade at 14.1 times.

Nearly all of Golden West's loans are ARMs, most carrying interest rates that change monthly. Its most popular 
product is the option ARM, which lets customers choose how much to pay each month, with unpaid interest 
added onto the mortgage and increasing the loan's balance. While such loans have been controversial among 
investors, Golden West has said it is sufficiently insulated from risk because of its 25 years of experience with its 
version of the option ARM. 
Much of Golden West's steady growth even during real-estate slumps can be traced to Mr. and Mrs. Sandler, 
who took over the company in 1963. Mrs. Sandler had been one of the first female stock-market analysts, 
covering the savings-and-loan industry, while her husband was a lawyer for S&Ls. After moving to California, they 
agreed to split the CEO duties, with Mrs. Sandler focusing on customer service and Mr. Sandler on 
administration. Together, the Sandlers control or have the right to acquire 31 million Golden West shares valued 
at $2.19-billion. As of March, Mr. Sandler was 74 years old, and Mrs. Sandler was 75, according to a securities 
filing. 
It wasn't immediately clear how much compensation the Sandlers could walk away with as part of the deal. 
According to securities filings, Golden West adopted a new stock-incentive plan for officers and employees as of 
last year, under which vesting and exercise of stock options may accelerate upon a change in control. The 
Sandlers each had unexercised options valued at more than $29 million as of Dec. 31.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones) -- Herbert Sandler, by his own admission, talks too much. 
But one conversation he had never had was the one concluding with an inked deal to sell his West Coast jewel, 
Golden West Financial Corp. (GDW) . That was until Sunday, when Wachovia Corp. announced a $25 billion 
cash-and-stock deal for the Oakland, Calif.-based thrift. 
To hear Herb Sandler put it, Wachovia's G. Kennedy Thompson was an important part of his decision to 
relinquish the reins of the bank that he -- with wife and co-CEO Marion Sandler -- built for 43 years. 
"These guys are tough SOBs," Sandler told analysts and investors. "They hew to their financial model, and they 
are willing to let a deal break if it does not meet the financial model." 
For his part, Thompson was the right man at the right time. He took over from the acquisitive Edward Crutchfield 
in 2001. Crutchfield's reign at Wachovia, then called First Union Corp., was a mixed bag. The company 
experienced tremendous growth through acquisitions, but it had trouble holding on to customers it picked up. 
"This deal would not have been made eight years ago under Crutchfield because I could not trust his desire to 
grow and grow and grow and add," Sandler said. "You have to do it right. You have to have standards. You have 
to have goals. You have to have lines, and these people have them. This guy on my right is really to tough, and 
he is so quiet and gentlemanly. 
"I can be a really miserable person," he said. "So I mean the point is I have every confidence," having 
investigated Wachovia's track record in deals made under Thompson. 
What he's likely to have learned in looking into Wachovia's recent past is that the company's performance has 
stabilized. Customer-attrition levels have fallen to 12% from 20% in 1999, according to company statistics. 
Earnings have risen 15% annually. Annual returns have risen 16.7% since First Union acquired Wachovia in 
2001, 21.3% since the Prudential Financial acquisition in 2003 and 17.3% since the acquisition of SouthTrust two 
years ago. 
But in selling, the Sandlers bring to a conclusion a colorful chapter in U.S. banking. The Sandlers founded 
Golden West in 1963 and built it -- on the back of adjustable-rate mortgages -- into the country's second-biggest 
thrift, behind only Washington Mutual Inc. (WM) . 
As husband and wife and as co-CEOs, the Sandlers survived by turning 19% annual earnings growth for most of 
the last four decades. During the housing boom, Golden West's returns rose to 26.6% annually. Morningstar, the 
Chicago-based research firm, named them co-CEOs of the year for 2004 and called their efforts in the area of 
corporate governance a "paragon." 
After the savings-and-loan crisis hit in 1989, 19 of the top 20 thrifts disappeared, either by being shuttered or 
bought. Golden West survived. 
The Sandlers didn't just make money; they gave it away to organizations sponsoring medical research, education 
and progressive government. They backed a successful ballot initiative in California for stem-cell research with a 
$1 million donation. 
Through it all, the Sandlers have brushed off criticism. True to form, Herb Sandler reaffirmed his stubborn 
reputation, allowing that critics could be right about his tendency to say too much. "For 39 years a lot of people

had a lot of criticism," he said. "Sometimes Herb Sandler speaks too much. He is a little too direct -- this kind of 
comment and that. But we have never been accused of stupidity." 
Nor have they been accused of poverty, a situation that will certainly not change in the deal. As of Dec. 29, 
Herbert and Marion Sandler each owned 27.8 million shares, now worth a combined $4.5 billion based 
Wachovia's closing price Friday. 
Despite their success and lengthy tenures, the Sandlers have been intent on sharing credit. "You don't run $120 
billion company with a nice couple," said Herb Sandler. "You run it with a team." He praised Chief Financial 
Officer Russ Kettell as his heir. Kettell, who also holds Golden West's presidency, is to take an undetermined 
role with Wachovia. 
"I mean, look, we are 74 and 75. You know, if [Wachovia's Thompson] is depending on us the next 15 years, he is 
in deep trouble," Sandler said. [ 05-08-06 1425ET ]
