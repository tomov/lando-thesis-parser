Oct. 11--Jefferson-Pilot Corp., a 102-year-old pillar of Greensboro's business community, said yesterday that it 
has agreed to be sold to Lincoln National Corp. in a $7.5 billion cash and stock deal. 
Analysts said that the deal could have significant implications for Greensboro, similar to that of the sale of 
Wachovia Corp. to First Union Corp. on Winston-Salem since 2001. 
The merged company, to be based in Philadelphia, would become the nation's largest writer of universal 
life-insurance policies. The deal, which is subject to approval by shareholders and regulators, is expected to close 
in the first quarter. 
The insurer would operate under the name of Lincoln Financial Group, which is a subsidiary of Lincoln National. 
The deal includes Jefferson-Pilot Communications and Jefferson-Pilot Sports' production and syndicated 
businesses. 
"These two companies are a perfect fit," Jon Boscia, the chairman and chief executive of Lincoln Financial, said 
in a conference call with analysts. Boscia will have the same role with the new company. 
"I know you hear this all the time, but in this case, it's really true," Boscia said. 
Lincoln is paying 1.09 shares or $55.48 in cash for each Jefferson-Pilot share. Jefferson-Pilot will own 39 
percent of the company and will have seven representatives on the 15-member board of directors. 
The company said that one reason the deal made sense is there is little overlap in their services. Lincoln 
Financial's main strength is in retirement services, while Jefferson-Pilot's is in life insurance. 
"Lincoln Financial Group is an ideal partner to merge with because of the complementary nature of our products, 
markets and distribution systems," Dennis Glass, the chief executive and president of Jefferson-Pilot, said in a 
statement. Glass will be president and chief operating officer of the company. 
Spokesmen from both companies said that there likely would be job cuts, but it was too early to determine how 
many positions would be affected. 
Bloomberg News reported that Glass said that as much as 10 percent of the companies' combined 9,436 work 
force could be eliminated to reduce expenses. Glass could not be reached for comment. 
"Although there is very little overlap in distribution networks, there is significant overlap in non-distribution-related 
functions," the companies said. The new company expects to achieve $180 million in annual cost savings. 
Jefferson-Pilot has about 1,100 employees in Greensboro, or just less than 25 percent of its overall work force 
of 4,436, spokesman Paul Mason said. Lincoln National has about 5,000 employees, spokesman Tom Johnson 
said. 
Analysts said there were several parallels between the Jefferson-Pilot and Wachovia deals. 
Lincoln Financial's life-insurance division will be consolidated in Greensboro and is projected to represent about 
45 percent of the combined company's annual revenue. 
Wachovia consolidated its Carolinas banking division and its wealth-management division in Winston-Salem as 
part of moving its headquarters to Charlotte. Those divisions have a combined local work force of about 3,000. 
Wachovia did cut 1,300 local jobs as part of the merger.

Page 4 of 56 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The merger will leave Greensboro with VF Corp. as its only company on the Fortune 500 list. 
Winston-Salem lost one of its three Fortune 500 companies in the Wachovia deal. The others are BB&T Corp. 
and Reynolds American Inc. 
"Certainly, the loss of another corporate headquarters doesn't help our ability to attract leading companies in the 
future," said Gary Shoesmith, an economics professor at Wake Forest University. 
"That's partly because of the blow to our image and prestige, but also because it is the CEOs of prestigious 
corporations that are often able to close the deal in recruiting new companies." 
Both companies also built signature headquarters in their respective hometown's downtowns. 
The potential decrease in local Jefferson-Pilot jobs could spur a similar chain reaction to Wachovia in 
entrepreneurial business development and companies gaining access to middle-management talent that they 
wouldn't have otherwise, said Don Jud, an professor emeritus of economics at the University of North Carolina at 
Greensboro. 
"We're seeing tremendous consolidation in financial services, and while we're more familiar with it in banking, it's 
been a similar situation going on in the insurance industry," said David Wood, a professor of insurance at 
Appalachian State University. 
"We've been fortunate that our state has been the beneficiary of the banking consolidation, and in some instances 
in the insurance industry. This deal just goes in the opposite direction." 
Keith Holliday, the mayor of Greensboro, said that Jefferson-Pilot officials told him that the resources of the 
combined insurer would strengthen the competitiveness of the life-insurance division and eventually could create 
several hundred local jobs. 
"We're glad that Greensboro will represent a key component of the new company, and we'll hopeful that the new 
company will choose to stay as influential in our community as Jefferson-Pilot has for 102 years," Holliday said. 
"But this does represent a step back in our campaign to keep and recruit corporate headquarters to Greensboro 
and the Triad. It will give us additional motivation in our recruitment efforts."

Shareholders will vote on the union of Lincoln National and Jefferson Pilot in 2006. 
Lincoln National Corp. said Monday it will acquire rival Jefferson-Pilot Corp. for about $7.5 billion in cash and 
stock as the two century-old companies create what executives said would be one of the largest publicly traded 
life insurance outfits in the nation. 
The buyer, which would retain the Lincoln National and Lincoln Financial Group names, would be the nation's 
largest seller of universal life insurance products and a leader in group disability insurance and retirement plan 
assets, the companies said. 
The deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter after shareholder and regulatory approval. 
Executives predicted annual cost savings of about $180 million after the two companies are combined. Lincoln 
National has annual sales of $5.4 billion, while Jefferson-Pilot has annual sales of $4.1 billion. 
Lincoln National CEO and Chairman Jon Boscia would serve as chairman and CEO of the newly combined 
company, while Jefferson Pilot CEO Dennis Glass would serve as president and chief operating officer and as a 
member of the board. 
The 15-member board of directors of the combined company would comprise eight Lincoln members and seven 
Jefferson Pilot members. Jefferson Pilot shareholders would own roughly 39 percent of the combined 
company. 
With about 5,200 employees, Lincoln National is larger than Jefferson-Pilot, which has 4,400 employees. But 
Jefferson-Pilot spokesman Paul Mason said the merger could bring more jobs to Greensboro, N.C., which will 
become the "center of operations" for the company's life insurance business. 
Under terms of the deal, Jefferson Pilot shareholders would receive 1.0906 Lincoln shares, a cash payment or a 
combination of shares and cash valued at $55.48 for each Jefferson Pilot share they own. 
The combination offer represents an 9.2 percent premium over Jefferson's Friday closing price of $50.79 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
Jefferson Pilot shares rose $3.02 to close at $53.81 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Lincoln 
National shares slipped 1.54 cents to $49.19.

Lincoln National will buy competitor Jefferson Pilot in a $7.5 billion cash-and-stock transaction that will create 
the fifth- largest life insurance company by sales. 
The merged entity will be a leader in the universal life insurance, variable annuity and equity-indexed annuity 
markets. It will be the seventh-largest in the life insurance and annuity industries by net premiums written, 
according to the Insurance Information Institute. 
Under the agreement, Jefferson Pilot shareholders can receive either 1.0906 Lincoln shares or $55.96 in cash 
for each Jefferson Pilot share. 
Lincoln National's stock fell 3% to $49.19, and Jefferson Pilot's stock rose 6% to $53.81 a share by Monday's 
close. 
The merger terms represent an 11% gain to Jefferson Pilot shareholders, based on the average closing prices 
of the companies' stock from Sept.7 through Friday. Lincoln shareholders will own 61% of the new company, 
which will have a nearly $16billion market capitalization and operate under the Lincoln name. 
The companies expect the deal to close in the first quarter of 2006 if shareholders and regulators give their 
approval. 
In a conference call Monday, Lincoln National Chief Executive Jon Boscia called the merger a "perfect fit." The 
company's ability to sell its products through more channels "is really at the heart of the combination," he said. 
In addition, its broad product mix will allow the new company to reach more customers in an extremely 
competitive industry, says Dafina Dunmore, an equity analyst at Morningstar. Dunmore does not own stock in 
either company. 
The deal -- billed by Lincoln and Jefferson as a merger of equals -- will increase operating efficiency and result in 
$180 million in annual pretax savings, much of that realized in the first two years, says Boscia, who will be CEO of 
the combined entity. 
The new company's resources will also let it pursue other "strategic opportunities," such as mergers and 
acquisitions, he adds. 
The merger will give the companies a significant presence in the Midwest and Southeast, according to Steven 
Weisbart, an economist at the Insurance Information Institute. 
But Weisbart says he wouldn't be surprised if the new company looks for a merger partner in the Northeast or 
West later.

Lincoln National Corp. said Monday that it will acquire rival Jefferson-Pilot Corp. for about $7.5 billion in cash 
and stock, as the two century-old companies create what executives said would be one of the largest publicly

Executives predicted annual cost savings of about $180 million after the two companies are combined. Lincoln 
National has annual sales of $5.4 billion, while Jefferson-Pilot has annual sales of $4.1 billion. 
"It makes perfect sense and it's just what the doctor ordered," analyst Tamara Kravec, who follows both 
companies for Bank of America Securities LLC, wrote to investors after the announcement. 
"Given the challenging operating environment for life insurers, we believe this merger makes perfect sense," she 
wrote. "The products and distribution channels of both companies are complementary and there is little overlap." 
The deal would combine Lincoln's strengths in life and annuities products with Jefferson-Pilot's sizable presence 
in fixed and variable universal life and fixed annuities, including equity-indexed annuities and other insurance, the 
companies said. 
Jon Boscia, Lincoln National's chief executive and chairman, who will hold the same role at the combined 
companies, called the two firms "a perfect fit." 
"I know you hear this all time, but in this case, it's really true," Boscia said.

Carolina city that will become the "center of operations" for the company's life insurance business. 
The combined company will have its headquarters in Philadelphia, with Fort Wayne, Ind., becoming the center of 
the company's annuity business. 
While job reductions were not discussed Monday, the companies said they plan to share services and consolidate 
functions to save money.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Lincoln National Corp. on Monday said it will acquire rival Jefferson-Pilot Corp. for about 
$7.5 billion in cash and stock, as the two century-old companies create what executives said would be one of the 
largest publicly traded life insurance companies in the U.S. 
The buyer, which will retain the Lincoln National and Lincoln Financial Group names, will be the nation's largest

Jefferson-Pilot spokesman Paul Mason said the merger could bring more jobs to Greensboro, the central North 
Carolina city that will become the "center of operations" for the company's life insurance business. Mason said 
that business will grow significantly as a result of the merger. 
"We anticipate several hundred new jobs in Greensboro over the next few years," he said. 
The combined company will be headquartered in Philadelphia, with Fort Wayne, Ind., becoming the center of the 
company's annuity business. 
Jefferson-Pilot's shares rose $3.02, or nearly 6 percent, to close at $53.81 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Lincoln National's shares lost $1.54, or 3 percent, to finish at $49.19 on the NYSE. 
Besides the cost savings, Lincoln National said, the acquisition should immediately boost its operating earnings, 
with the merged company experiencing annual growth of 6 to 7 percent by the end of 2007. 
While job reductions were not specifically discussed Monday, the companies said in a statement they planned to 
share services and consolidate some functions to save money. "It would be impossible to have a merger of this 
size without some kind of impact [on jobs]," said Lincoln National spokesman Tom Johnson.

Lincoln National has no immediate plans for Jefferson-Pilot Communications, a unit that owns and operates 
three television stations, 18 radio stations and a sports production and syndication business. Executives said they 
focused on the companies' core businesses during buyout talks. 
"This will create one of the largest publicly traded life insurance companies in the U.S.," Boscia said. "This critical 
mass is becoming an increasingly important factor in achieving success in this industry." 
Cost savings were less of a motivation for the deal than the opportunity to increase sales, said Jefferson-Pilot 
CEO Dennis Glass, who will become president and chief operating officer. 
The 15-member board of directors of the combined company will comprise eight Lincoln members and seven 
Jefferson-Pilot members. Jefferson-Pilot shareholders will own roughly 39 percent of the combined company. 
Under terms of the deal, Jefferson-Pilot shareholders will receive 1.0906 Lincoln shares, a cash payment or a 
combination of shares and cash valued at $55.48 for each Jefferson-Pilot share they own. 
The combination offer represents a 9.2 percent premium over Jefferson's Friday closing price of $50.79 on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

The combination offer represents an 9.2 percent premium over Jefferson's Friday closing price of $50.79 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
Jefferson Pilot shares rose $3.02 to close at $53.81 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Lincoln 
National shares slipped 1.54 cents to $49.19.

Lincoln National Corp. will acquire rival insurer Jefferson-Pilot Corp. in a $7.5 billion deal that has led some 
industry experts to predict more mergers and acquisitions in the sector. 
The cash-and-stock deal, announced early yesterday after The Wall Street Journal disclosed news of weekend 
talks, will let Philadelphia-based Lincoln expand its national coverage with the strong southeastern presence of 
Jefferson-Pilot, based in Greensboro, N.C. Lincoln said the combined company will have a $15.6 billion market 
capitalization, putting it behind competitors MetLife Inc., Prudential Financial Inc. and Hartford Financial Services 
Group Inc. 
The merged company is more likely to find shelf space from the independent insurance agents and brokers both 
companies use to sell their products, one reason the deal could encourage other national insurers to consider 
buying regional companies, analysts said. "They don't want to deal with two dozen companies," Donald Light, an 
insurance analyst with research firm Celent Communications LLC, said of agents and brokers. 
Jefferson-Pilot shares were up $3.02, or 6%, at $53.81 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
Jefferson holders will get an 11% premium over the average closing price of the past month. The deal is expected 
to close in the first quarter. 
Lincoln National slipped $1.54, or 3%, to $49.19, making it among the biggest decliners in the sector. Lincoln said 
it expects to book a pretax "implementation" charge of $180 million, spread out over two years, following approval 
of the deal by regulators. Lincoln also said the deal is expected to add "modestly" to operating earnings in the first 
year, before boosting that figure by 6% to 7% by the end of 2007. 
The combined company, which will keep Lincoln's brand, will likely use its cash flow to seek other deals, Lincoln 
National's chairman and chief executive officer, Jon Boscia, said during a conference call. Mr. Boscia, who will 
retain his posts, said economies of scale and the ability to expand sales-distribution networks were the primary 
motivations for the deal. 
"It's very unusual to find two organizations with essentially no overlap in the distribution channels," Dennis Glass, 
Jefferson Pilot's president and CEO, who will be president and chief operating officer of the merged company, 
said in an interview. 
Jefferson-Pilot was advised by Lazard Ltd., Morgan Stanley and attorneys at King &Spalding. Lincoln was 
advised by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and the law firm LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene 
&MacRae. 
Potential industry acquisition targets include Nationwide Financial Services Inc. and Ameriprise Financial Inc., 
said Andrew Kligerman, a UBS Investment Research insurance analyst, in a report.

Lincoln National, a midsize U.S. life insurance company, is in advanced talks to buy a smaller rival, Jefferson 
Pilot Financial, for about $7.5 billion, according to people briefed on the transaction. 
The deal, which was expected to be announced as soon as Monday, may be presented as a merger of equals, 
despite the disparity in size. 
Lincoln, with assets of $91.7 billion, compared with $29.5 billion for Jefferson, is expected to pay a premium of 
about 10 percent over Jefferson's closing price on Friday of $50.79 a share. And Jon Boscia, the chief executive 
of Lincoln, is expected to take charge of the combined company. People briefed on the transaction cautioned that 
negotiations had not yet been completed and that the talks could still collapse. 
Spokesmen for the companies did not return phone calls for comment, but other industry executives said that 
midlevel executives at Lincoln had been told that they would be calling brokerage houses and other distributors of 
Lincoln's products as soon as Monday to inform them of the merger. 
Lincoln, which is based in Philadelphia, reported earnings of $707 million on revenue of $5.4 billion last year. 
Jefferson Pilot, whose main offices are in Greensboro, North Carolina, had net income of $546 million on $4.1 
billion in revenue. Both companies have been in business for nearly 100 years. 
Last fall, Boscia signaled his intention to use acquisitions to move Lincoln up from the range of midsize 
companies. After the merger, Lincoln, which is already a leader in the sale of variable annuities a combination of 
mutual funds and insurance would rise in a merger from 16th to 12th in the rankings of American insurance 
companies, with $121 billion in assets, according to A.M. Best, a rating agency. 
A merger would also put Lincoln in fifth place after Prudential Financial in the sale of life insurance, and raise it to 
fifth place after MetLife in the rankings for sales of fixed annuities, which provide a modest but steady return 
without taxation until the savings are withdrawn. 
Even after a merger with Jefferson, Lincoln would lag far behind the giants of life insurance in size. Analysts 
estimate the assets of MetLife, the largest of the companies focusing on life insurance, at more than $400 billion. 
And Lincoln and Jefferson would have a combined market value of $15.5 billion, compared with $36.6 billion for 
MetLife 
Industry specialists said that a deal with Jefferson could add stability to Lincoln's earnings, which are volatile 
because of its emphasis on variable annuities and their fluctuations in the stock market. But the specialists said 
that Jefferson's heavy lineup of sluggish and, at the moment, underperforming fixed annuities and traditional life 
insurance could also slow the pace of Lincoln's growth. 
Lincoln and Jefferson, the specialists said, have posted shrinking earnings on fixed annuities and traditional life 
insurance as interest rates have fallen. With those products, the insurers typically contracted to provide a return to 
investors of 3 percent or 4 percent.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Insurance provider Lincoln National Corp. agreed yesterday to acquire Jefferson-Pilot 
Corp. for about $7.5-billion (U.S.) in cash and stock to create one of the largest insurance companies in the 
United States. 
The deal will combine Lincoln's strengths in life and annuities products with Greensboro, N.C.-based 
Jefferson-Pilot's sizable presence in fixed and variable universal life and fixed annuities, including 
equity-indexed annuities and other insurance, the companies said in a statement. 
The deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2006, will make Lincoln the top-ranked seller of 
universal life product sales, as well as a leading player in group disability sales and retirement plan assets, the 
companies said. 
In a morning conference call following the announcement, executives predicted annual cost savings of about 
$180-million after the two companies are combined. 
“These two companies are a perfect fit,” said Jon Boscia, Lincoln's chief executive officer and chairman, who will 
have the same role for the combined company. “I know you hear this all time, but in this case it's really true.” 
Besides the cost savings, Lincoln said the acquisition should immediately add to its operating profit. 
The merged company will be headquartered in Philadelphia, where Lincoln is based, while Greensboro will be the 
major centre of operations for life insurance. Fort Wayne, Ind., will be the centre for the company's annuity 
operations, the companies said. 
Jefferson-Pilot's sizable operations in Concord, N.H., and Hartford, Conn., will remain, according to a merger 
fact sheet on the Internet. 
While possible job reductions were not specifically discussed, the companies said they planned to share services 
and consolidate some functions to save money. 
“This will create one of the largest publicly traded life insurance companies in the U.S.,” Mr. Boscia said. 
“This critical mass is becoming an increasingly important factor in achieving success in this industry,” he added. 
Cost savings were less of a motivation for the deal than the opportunity to increase sales, said Jefferson-Pilot 
CEO Dennis Glass, who will become president and chief operating officer of the new company. 
The 15-member board of directors of the combined company will comprise eight Lincoln members and seven 
Jefferson-Pilot members. Jefferson-Pilot shareholders will own roughly 39 per cent of the combined company. 
Under terms of the deal, Jefferson-Pilot shareholders will receive 1.0906 Lincoln shares or a cash payment or a 
combination of shares and cash valued at $55.48 for each Jefferson-Pilot share they own.

Lincoln National, one of the biggest life insurers in midwestern US, has agreed to buy Jefferson Pilot Financial, 
its smaller southern rival, for about Dollars 7.5bn in cash and stock. 
Following the merger, yet to be approved by regulators and shareholders, the Lincoln Financial Group will 
become the fourth-largest life assurer in the US with assets of Dollars 151bn. 
It will offer a range of life insurance and retirement products and be a top provider of fixed and variable annuities. 
In addition, the company will control Delaware Investments, Lincoln's asset management group, and Jefferson 
Pilot Communications, which operates a string of television and radio stations. 
Analysts yesterday praised the merger and said it was a way for the two insurers - which are facing difficulties in 
some of their businesses due to low interest rates - to overcome the challenges of their operating environment. 
Tamara Kravec of Banc of America said: "It's just what the doctor ordered. Given the challenging operating 
environment for life insurers, we believe this merger makes perfect sense. The products and distribution channels 
of both companies are complementary and there is little overlap." 
She forecast that further similar deals "could be on the way". 
Under the terms of the transaction, shareholders in Jefferson Pilot will receive 1.0906 Lincoln shares or Dollars 
55.96 - representing a 9 per cent premium over Jefferson's closing price on Friday. Lincoln shareholders will 
control about 61 per cent of the group. 
The group would like to see yearly cost savings of about Dollars 180m before tax within three years. 
Jon Boscia, Lincoln chairman and chief executive, will head the merged group and Dennis Glass, president and 
chief executive of Jefferson Pilot, will serve as president and chief operating officer. 
Suneet Kamath, analyst with Sanford Bernstein, said: "The merger will allow the combined company to create 
more earnings diversity." 
Standard &Poor's and AM Best, two insurance rating agencies, yesterday placed Lincoln National on review with 
positive implications. 
In early trade, Jefferson Pilot shares rose 6.6 per cent to Dollars 54.14 while Lincoln National shares inched 
down 2 per cent to Dollars 49.70.

Deals & Deal Makers: Lincoln National Agrees to Acquire Jefferson-Pilot

NEW YORK -- Lincoln National Corp. agreed to acquire Jefferson-Pilot Corp. for $7.5 billion in cash and stock, 
creating an insurance firm with a market capitalization nearing $16 billion. 
The two insurers said the purchase price gives Jefferson-Pilot holders an 11% premium over the average 
closing price over the past month. Lincoln, of Philadelphia, agreed to pay 1.0906 shares or $55.96 in cash for 
each Jefferson share, with the aggregate cash payment totaling $1.8 billion. Following the deal, Jefferson-Pilot, 
of Greensboro, North Carolina, will hold 39% of the combined company. 
Lincoln National said it expects to book a pretax "implementation" charge of $180 million, spread out over the two 
years following final approval of the deal. The companies anticipate saving about $180 million pretax a year 
starting in 2008, primarily from lower overhead costs. The deal is expected to add "modestly" to operating 
earnings in the first year, before boosting that figure 6% to 7% by the end of 2007, the companies said. 
Lincoln National Chairman and Chief Executive Jon Boscia was named chairman and chief executive of the 
combined company. Dennis Glass, president and chief executive at Jefferson-Pilot, will take over as president 
and chief operating officer. 
Mr. Boscia, who will retire in 2006, said the deal has a $300 million breakup fee, which he said was likely to 
prevent other offers. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2006. 
He said the combined company's risk profile would be more attractive than the two companies alone and that 
earnings will be more stable and diversified. He said the company plans no changes to its structure. 
Jefferson-Pilot's Mr. Glass said he expects a 10% head-count reduction. 
In midday New York Stock Exchange composite trading, shares of Lincoln National were down 81 cents, or 1.6%, 
to $49.92, while Jefferson-Pilot shares were up $3.49, or 6.9%, to $54.28. 
Both Lincoln National and Jefferson-Pilot long have itched to move from their perch as midsize players in the 
insurance and annuity business and find in each other firms of roughly equivalent size. Lincoln has a market 
value of $8.8 billion. 
Low interest rates have hurt life insurers, which profit in part on the difference between the interest they can earn 
in the bond market and the interest rates they pay those who buy their life-insurance policies and annuity 
contracts. As higher-yield securities mature, insurers find themselves able to replace them only with 
lower-yielding bonds. 
Moreover, choppy equity markets have made some of the industry's past big sellers -- particularly variable 
annuities, which combine elements of insurance and mutual funds -- less attractive than they are during bull 
markets. 
Since the mid-1990s, Lincoln has been the more aggressive of the two companies, using a series of acquisitions 
and divestitures to expand and concentrate on its business selling life insurance, annuities, mutual funds and 
401(k) plans. This has been no easy task given that the goal has been shared by a large number of equally 
determined rivals. 
Jefferson-Pilot for decades has been a prominent seller of life insurance and related products in the Southeast 
U.S. Because of its size, it has been on investment bankers' list of potential acquisition targets for at least 10 
years.

SAN FRANCISCO (XFN-ASIA) -- Lincoln National Corp. on Monday said it will buy Jefferson-Pilot Corp. for $7.5 
billion, a deal expected to create the fifth-largest U.S. life insurer and a top-ten player in the annuity business. 
The deal is the largest acquisition in the insurance industry since MetLife Inc. bought Travelers Life & Annuity 
from Citigroup Inc. for $11.8 billion in July. 
Lincoln National said it's offering 1.0906 shares or $55.96 in cash for each Jefferson-Pilot share, subject to 
proration. The cash portion of the deal will be capped at $1.8 billion, meaning shareholders aren't likely to get the 
$55.96. 
Based on Friday closing prices, Lincoln said the deal would result in a payment of $55.48 per share in cash and 
stock for Jefferson-Pilot. Such a 9% premium values the Greensboro, N.C.-based life insurer at about $7.5 
billion. 
Jefferson-Pilot's shares jumped 6% to $53.81 on Monday, while Lincoln National slid 3% to $49.19. 
The combination will create a company with a broader range of life-insurance and annuity products, helping it to 
better weather the ups and downs of the stock and bond markets, analysts said. 
"The logic of the deal is that bigger is better in terms of sales diversification," said Steven Schwartz, analyst at 
Raymond James & Associates. 
"The new company will have different products and a presence in more markets," Schwartz added. "Demand for 
products turns on and off: Sometimes fixed products are hot and sometimes variable ones are. With a broader 
product portfolio, the company will have something to sell no matter what the environment is." 
On its own, Jefferson-Pilot generated 58% of its operating income from life insurance and just 14% from 
retirement products including annuities in the 12 months ended June 30, according to a deal fact sheet provided 
by the two insurers. 
The combined company will be more balanced, getting an estimated 45% of its operating profit from life insurance 
and 38% from annuities. 
The companies said they'll rank No. 5 among U.S. life insurers and No. 5 in variable-annuity sales. The business 
will be the largest universal life company by sales, they added. 
That size should give the combined business a higher profile, helping it to sell more products, Schwartz noted. 
Growth challenges 
Analysts weren't so upbeat about the new company's growth prospects, however. 
Low interest rates have made it more difficult for life insurers to make money on the difference between the 
returns they offer to policyholders and annuity customers and the yields they garner from investing in bonds. 
The annuity business has also become increasingly competitive in recent years as companies fight for market 
share by offering new products with generous benefits and features.

Page 21 of 56 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"The combined company will be stronger from a distribution and product standpoint," David Lewis, analyst at 
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, wrote in a note to clients. "Nevertheless, we do not expect the merger of the two 
companies to alleviate the pressures from low fixed product sales and the challenging interest-rate environment." 
Deutsche Bank analyst Vanessa Wilson said that, by itself, the deal's "unlikely to fix growth challenges" faced by 
the companies. 
Both Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot are already struggling in competitive annuity and life markets, and scale 
advantages won't help, Wilson said. 
"Distribution diversification does not accelerate growth, given the large market shares" of the companies, she 
added. "Low interest rates are the most serious margin pressure in the life industry currently and we do not see 
this combination providing a solution to the problem." 
Earnings outlook 
Lincoln said it expects the deal to boost operating earnings per share "modestly" during the first year and to lift 
profit by 6% to 7% by the end of 2007. 
Annual pretax cost savings of $180 million should kick in fully by 2008. Half of those savings will come within a 
year of the deal and 80% within two years, Lincoln added. 
The company also said it sees taking a one-time charge of $180 million for the acquisition. 
Jon Boscia, Lincoln National's chairman and chief executive, will serve as chairman and CEO after the purchase, 
while Jefferson-Pilot CEO Dennis Glass will serve as president, chief operating officer and a director of the 
combined firm. 
Boscia said Lincoln will adopt Jefferson-Pilot's operating model, a move welcomed by some analysts. 
"Jefferson-Pilot's disciplined pricing strategy and low-cost administrative platform represent significant 
competitive advantages relative to its peers," SunTrust's Lewis said.

The merger of equals between Lincoln Financial Group, celebrating its centennial anniversary this year, and 
Jefferson Pilot Financial, a 102-year- old financial organization, will create one of the most powerful financial 
services distribution forces in the nation with significant scale and reach in the life insurance, annuity and 
investment product marketplace. The combination of these two companies brings together distribution networks 
with very little overlap, and multi-channel reach that includes affiliated planners, independent registered 
representatives, independent marketing organizations, financial institutions and wirehouse/regional 
broker-dealers. 
The combined company will market a broad, balanced product mix of retirement income, fixed and variable asset 
protection, accumulation and transfer products, and other investment services. The merged company will be 
ranked #1 in the industry for universal life product sales (Source: LIMRA) and will be one of the country's largest 
public life insurance companies. 
In addition, in the Employer Sponsored/Group market, the combined company will be #8 in group disability sales, 
#13 in group life sales, and the #6 publicly traded insurer in defined contribution and retirement plan assets 
(Sources: LIMRA and Pensions and Investments).

The product lines of each company are complementary and enhance the growth potential of the combined 
company. The merger brings together Lincoln's strength in life and annuities, including fixed and variable 
universal life and variable annuities, and its leading 401(k) and 403(b) offerings, with Jefferson Pilot's strength in 
fixed and variable universal life and fixed annuities, including equity indexed annuities, and group life, disability 
and dental insurance products. 
The combined company will also include Delaware Investments, Lincoln's investment management organization; 
Jefferson-Pilot Communications, which owns and operates three television stations, 18 radio stations, and the 
Jefferson Pilot Sports production and syndication business; and Lincoln U.K. 
Delivering Significant Value to Shareholders Through Synergies and Growth 
Although there is very little overlap in distribution networks, there is significant overlap in non-distribution related 
functions. The combined company expects to achieve total annual cost savings of approximately $180 million 
pre-tax, with 50 percent achieved within 12 months of closing, 80 percent within 24 months, and the balance by 
the end of 2008. These cost savings are expected to result from greater efficiencies through shared services, the 
consolidation of corporate functions, and reductions in business unit costs. Based on I/B/E/S estimates, the 
merger is expected to be modestly accretive to Lincoln's operating earnings per share in the first year, building to 
6 percent to 7 percent by end of 2007. These numbers exclude a one-time implementation cost associated with 
the transaction of approximately $180 million pre-tax, substantially all of which will be incurred during the two 
years following the close. 
While not included in the expected earnings accretion calculation, the merged company expects to benefit from 
revenue enhancement opportunities across business units, distribution channels, and product lines, by leveraging 
the diverse distribution strengths that exist in both companies. The merged company also expects to benefit from 
strong earnings diversification, fueled by a stable earnings base with an attractive platform for growth. 
This merger combines the financial strength of two highly respected companies, resulting in an organization with 
increased size, diversity of earnings, and an attractive risk profile. Having reviewed the merger with all four major 
rating agencies, management expects the combined company to operate initially with a strong AA financial 
strength rating. 
Highly Experienced Management Team 
The senior leadership team for the combined company has been identified and management continuity will be 
strong with key senior management talent from both organizations. Jon Boscia, Chairman and CEO of Lincoln, 
will serve as Chairman and CEO post-merger, while Dennis Glass, President and CEO of Jefferson Pilot, will 
serve as President and Chief Operating Officer and as a member of the board of directors. The 15-member board 
of directors for the merged company will consist of 8 Lincoln representatives and 7 Jefferson Pilot 
representatives, and the lead director will be a Jefferson Pilot representative (see Merger Fact Sheet for 
organization chart at http://www.lfgjpmerger.com/ ). 
Commenting on the merger, Boscia said, "Lincoln Financial Group and Jefferson Pilot Financial are highly 
complementary organizations, and by joining forces we will create a company with enhanced scale, a 
comprehensive and balanced product portfolio, greater distribution penetration and geographic and market 
diversity -- in short, a company that is extremely well- positioned for even greater growth in the financial services 
marketplace. Specifically, as baby boomers continue to mature, opportunities in the retirement income segment of 
the market become even more attractive. This combination will further round out both companies' product 
offerings in the wealth protection, accumulation and enjoyment areas and strengthen our leadership position in 
this space. In addition to enhanced opportunities for growth, the combined company will also benefit from 
significant operational efficiencies across the organization. Jefferson Pilot has a strong and efficient operating 
model, and we intend to apply this proven model to the combined company." 
Boscia added, "Beyond our strength in financial services, the new company will have an extremely attractive 
portfolio of broadcasting assets in Jefferson-Pilot Communications. This is a unique and strong franchise, which 
will provide earnings diversity to Lincoln and an additional outlet for publicizing the Lincoln Financial Group brand 
and remain a key part of the overall organization." 
Glass said, "Jefferson Pilot has always been alert for opportunities to grow and diversify our business. Lincoln 
Financial Group is an ideal partner to merge with because of the complementary nature of our products, markets 
and distribution systems. Both companies enjoy century-long histories of success in the financial services industry 
and strong reputations for quality and performance. Together, we will have a balanced base of earnings spread 
across individual and employer markets providing life, retirement and investment products."

Once the merger is complete, Lincoln Financial Group's corporate offices will be headquartered in Philadelphia. 
Greensboro, NC will be the major center of operations for life insurance, and Fort Wayne, IN will be the center for 
annuity operations. Significant operations also will be located in the companies' existing locations in Concord, NH, 
and Hartford, CT. Jefferson Pilot's group insurance business, located in Omaha, NE, will remain in place, as will 
Jefferson-Pilot Communications Company. 
Glass concluded, "The merger of equals of Lincoln Financial Group and Jefferson Pilot is a compelling 
combination that will provide valuable benefits to shareholders, clients and employees. In addition to having 
access to a broader array of products, clients also will benefit from both organizations' shared commitment to 
providing superior service and support. For shareholders, this merger presents a tremendous value creation 
opportunity through marketing synergies, a powerful distribution network, broad product mix, and business 
efficiencies. For all of our constituencies, the result will be a larger, more dynamic enterprise with greater 
resources and significant growth potential."

Group's financial advisors were Goldman Sachs & Co. and Lehman Brothers Inc. Legal counsel to Jefferson 
Pilot was King & Spalding LLP and Lincoln National's legal counsel was LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae LLP.

10 October 2005 
CNBC/Dow Jones Business Video

BILL GRIFFETH, CNBC ANCHOR: So we woke up this morning to a merger in the insurance business, Lincoln 
National buying rival Jefferson-Pilot. It`s a $7.5 billion deal in cash and stock to create the nation`s fourth largest 
life insurer. Pending approval from shareholders and regulatory approval, the deal is expected to close first 
quarter of next year. So far today, Lincoln National has been down over a dollar at $49.68, while Jefferson- Pilot 
has been up more than $3 at $54.13. First on CNBC to tell us more about the deal, Lincoln`s Chairman and CEO 
John Boscia is back with us. And that`s Dennis Glass, the president and CEO of Jefferson-Pilot. 
Gentlemen, good see you both, thanks for joining us today. 
JON BOSCIA, CHAIRMAN & CEO, LINCOLN NATIONAL: Our pleasure, thanks for having us. 
GRIFFETH: Mr. Glass, I always like to start with the seller on a deal like this. Your company has been rumored as 
a takeover target for a number of years, at least a decade. Why sell now, what took so long? 
DENNIS GLASS, PRESIDENT & CEO, JEFFERSON-PILOT: Well, we don`t think of it as a sale, we think of it as 
a merger of equals. There`s continuity of board, continuity of senior management, continuity of shareholders, so 
we think it`s a good opportunity for us. Jefferson-Pilot has always been alert to the opportunity to increase 
shareholder value, have a bigger market position. And combining with John`s organization is just a great 
opportunity for us. 
GRIFFETH: Mr. Boscia, I know you acknowledged in your conference call this morning with analysts, you`ve 
been talking with Jefferson for a while. What won them over finally, price or what? 
BOSCIA: No, I think as I indicated on the conference call, that whenever you`re doing a deal such as this, you 
have to have a lot of factors that come into play and align at the right time. One of them is certainly stock price 
and your ability to be able to do the deal, but there`s distribution opportunities, there`s product opportunities. We 
just really had a nice confluence of all of the events. Any of them at any given point in time might hurt a deal, but 
they all went the right way. 
GRIFFETH: I think we would all acknowledge this is not the perfect environment for insurance products right now. 
These low rates that we see are not great for your margins on some of the projects, especially as various 
annuities expire with the older rates. The lousy stock market, for the most part, has hurt your variable annuity 
business, not just yours, but the industry itself. So as well, Mr. Boscia, is this sort of a merger that sort of provides 
you the economies of scale to weather these tougher times in your business? 
BOSCIA: Well, it does provide us economy of scale, that`s clearly one of the benefits of it. The environment will 
be what the environment is, there`s not much that we can do about low interest rates or stock markets that go 
sideways, but independent of low interest rates and stock markets, we have had very good organic growth. So 
being able to take that top line revenue impact and then get economies of scale just creates the situation for 
tremendous, tremendous shareholder value creation. 
GRIFFETH: Mr. Glass, on the conference call, you both acknowledged that there`d probably be more acquisitions 
down the road. What are you looking for? Is it a geographic footprint you`re looking for? Different products? 
What`re you going to go after, you think? 
GLASS: Well, at the moment, we`re going to spend our time integrating these two fine companies, that`s the first 
order of business. But John and I have both been alert to opportunities in the insurance business primarily over 
the last couple of years and will continue to look at things that make sense. We start off with our strategic goals, 
and any acquisition that would accelerate those opportunities or that plan would be something we`d look at.

Page 29 of 56 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
GRIFFETH: I know that we`re talking about these economies of scale and synergies and things like that, but you 
did acknowledge in the conference call they`re probably going to be layoffs as well, Mr. Glass, yes? 
GLASS: There will be layoffs. That`s what`s embedded -- a head count reduction is embedded in the $180 
million, but that`s a near-term issue. Long-term, this will be a bigger more powerful company with greater job 
opportunities for people, and that`s what John and I are looking forward to. 
GRIFFETH: Speaking of Mr. Boscia, you`re scheduled to retire next year, sir. Are you sitting next to your 
successor? 
BOSCIA: I didn`t know I was scheduled to retire next year. 
GRIFFETH: It says so in the wire copy. According to, it was either Dow Jones or Reuters I read, that said that 
John Boscia is scheduled to retire in 2006. Is that not true? 
BOSCIA: That`s not true. 
GRIFFETH: Well, OK. Then the wire stories don`t have that. So you how long, you`re going to be the chairman 
and CEO of the combined entity. Mr. Glass, I guess you`re going to be chief operating officer. Any thoughts of 
succession issues at this point, or is that too far down the road? 
BOSCIA: Way too early to be talking about that. We need to be focusing in on extracting these cost saves as 
soon as we can. But more importantly, defining and setting up that engine of growth. 
GLASS: John and I are about building a great organization for our employees, for our shareholders, and right 
now, our focus is on that. 
GRIFFETH: We wish you well on the merger, Mr. Boscia. We wish you well on a long tenure there. 
BOSCIA: 2006 was interesting. 
GRIFFETH: John Boscia, chairman and CEO of Lincoln National, and Dennis Glass, the president of 
Jefferson-Pilot, soon to be COO of the combined entity.

NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Lincoln National Corp. a midsize U.S. life insurance company, is in advanced 
talks to buy smaller rival Jefferson-Pilot Corp. for about $7.5 billion, the New York Times reported Monday, citing 
people briefed on the transaction. 
The deal, which could be announced as early as Monday, may be presented as a merger of equals, despite 
Lincoln's $91.7 billion in assets compared with $29.5 billion for Jefferson. 
Lincoln is expected to pay a premium of about 10 percent over Jefferson's closing price on Friday of $50.79 a 
share, the newspaper said. Jon Boscia, the chief executive of Lincoln, is expected to take charge of the 
combined companies. 
People briefed on the deal cautioned talks had not been completed and could still collapse, the paper said. 
Lincoln, based in Philadelphia, reported earnings of $707 million on revenue of $5.4 billion last year. Jefferson 
Pilot, whose main offices are in Greensboro, N.C., had net income of $546 million on $4.1 billion in revenue. 
After the merger, Lincoln would rise to 12th from 16th in the rankings of U.S. insurance companies with $121 
billion in assets, according to rating agency A.M. Best Co. The new company would also rank fifth in the sale of 
life insurance and fixed annuities. 
Industry specialists said a deal with Jefferson could add stability to Lincoln's earnings, which are volatile because 
of its emphasis on variable annuities and their fluctuations in the stock market. Yet Jefferson's lineup of sluggish 
fixed annuities and traditional life insurance could also slow the pace of Lincoln's growth, the paper said. 
Industry specialists said Jefferson Pilot had been looking for a merger partner for more than three years 
because its earnings have been stagnant and its ability to compete has been limited by its smaller size, the Times 
said.

Lincoln National, one of the biggest life insurers in midwestern US, has agreed to buy Jefferson Pilot Financial, 
its smaller southern rival, for about $7.5bn in cash and stock. 
Following the merger, yet to be approved by regulators and shareholders, the Lincoln Financial Group will 
become the fourth-largest life assurer in the US with assets of $151bn. 
It will offer a range of life insurance and retirement products and be a top provider of fixed and variable annuities. 
In addition, the company will control Delaware Investments, Lincoln's asset management group, and Jefferson 
Pilot Communications, which operates a string of television and radio stations. 
Analysts yesterday praised the merger and said it was a way for the two insurers - which are facing difficulties in 
some of their businesses due to low interest rates - to overcome the challenges of their operating environment. 
Tamara Kravec of Banc of America said: "It's just what the doctor ordered. Given the challenging operating 
environment for life insurers, we believe this merger makes perfect sense. The products and distribution channels 
of both companies are and there is little overlap." 
She forecast that further similar deals "could be on the way". 
Under the terms of the transaction, shareholders in Jefferson Pilot will receive 1.0906 Lincoln shares or $55.96 - 
representing a 9 per cent premium over Jefferson's closing price on Friday. Lincoln shareholders will control 
about 61 per cent of the group. 
The group would like to see yearly cost savings of about $180m before tax within three years. 
Jon Boscia, Lincoln chairman and chief executive, will head the merged group and Dennis Glass, president and 
chief executive of Jefferson Pilot, will serve as president and chief operating officer. 
Suneet Kamath, analyst with Sanford Bernstein, said: "The merger will allow the combined company to create 
more earnings diversity." Standard &Poor's and AM Best, two insurance rating agencies, yesterday placed 
Lincoln National on review with positive implications. 
In early trade, Jefferson Pilot shares rose 6.6 per cent to $54.14 while Lincoln National shares inched down 2 
per cent to $49.70.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones) -- Lincoln National Corp. on Monday said it will buy Jefferson-Pilot Corp. for $7.5 
billion, in one of the biggest acquisitions in the financial sector in months. 
Lincoln National (LNC) will pay $55.48 a share in cash and stock for Jefferson-Pilot (JP) in a deal that values the 
Greensboro, N.C., life insurer at about 9% above its closing price at $50.79 on Friday. 
Philadelphia-based Lincoln National will emerge as one of the largest public life insurance companies, with a 
"broad, balanced product mix" of retirement income, fixed and variable-asset protection, accumulation and 
transfer products and other investment services, the companies said. 
Under terms of the deal, each Jefferson-Pilot share will be exchanged for 1.0906 Lincoln shares, or $55.96 
cash, subject to peroration. 
Lincoln expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2006, and to add to earnings during the first year, and to 
add 6% to 7% by the end of 2007. 
Lincoln National expects a $180 million charge on the merger. 
"This merger combines the financial strength of two highly respected companies, resulting in an organization with 
increased size, diversity of earnings, and an attractive risk profile," Lincoln National said. 
Lincoln National Chairman and Chief Executive Jon Boscia will serve as chairman and CEO after the merger, 
while Jefferson-Pilot CEO Dennis Glass will serve as president, chief operation officer and director of the 
combined firm. 
Deutsche Bank analyst Vanessa Wilson on Monday said the proposed merger is "unlikely to fix growth 
challenges" to the companies. 
Both companies are already struggling in competitve annuity and life markets and scale advantages will not 
alleviate this, Wilson said. 
"Distribution diversification does not accelerate growth, given the large market shares" of the companies, she 
said. "Low interest rates are the most serious margin pressure in the life industry currently and we do not see this 
combination providing a solution to the problem." 
Lincoln shares closed Friday up 77 cents at $50.73 and Jefferson-Pilot fell 40 cents to $50.79. [ 10-10-05

CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) said Monday its merger with Jefferson-Pilot Corp. (JP) 
will give it significant cash flow and a platform for further acquisitions. 
Lincoln National announced early Monday that it would acquire Jefferson-Pilot for $7.5 billion in stock. The 
combined company has a market capitalization of nearly $16 billion. 
In a conference call following the announcement, Jon Boscia, Lincoln's chairman and chief executive, said he 
had talked about doing a deal for years with various Jefferson-Pilot executives. 
He also said that once the company is integrated it will be better able to go after other deals. The economies of 
scale along with the ability to expand their sales distribution network were the primary motivations for the deal. 
Boscia said the deal has a $300 million break-up fee, which will likely prevent other offers. The deal is expected to 
close in the first quarter of 2006. 
He said the combined company's risk profile would be more attractive than the two companies alone and that 
earnings will be more stable and diversified. He said the company plans no changes to its structure. 
But Jefferson-Pilot's president, Dennis Glass, who will serve as president and chief operating officer of the 
combined company, said he expects a 10% head-count reduction. 
The combined company's return on equity will start out at about 12%, but will rise into the teens, Boscia said. 
According to the companies, the merger will combine two complementary distribution networks with little overlap, 
while allowing the company to save about $180 million pretax a year beginning in 2008 from lower overhead 
costs. It also allows for greater breadth of product offerings. The combined company will be the fifth largest in 
total life insurance sales. 
Shares of Lincoln National recently were down 62 cents, or 1.2%, to $50.11. Jefferson-Pilot shares were up

CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) said Monday its merger with Jefferson-Pilot Corp. (JP) 
will give it significant cash flow and a platform for further acquisitions. 
Lincoln National announced early Monday that it would acquire Jefferson-Pilot for $7.5 billion in stock. The 
combined company has a market capitalization of nearly $16 billion. 
In a conference call following the announcement, Jon Boscia, Lincoln's chairman and chief executive, said he 
had talked about doing a deal for years with various Jefferson-Pilot executives. 
He also said that once the company is integrated it will be better able to go after other deals. The economies of 
scale along with the ability to expand their sales distribution network were the primary motivations for the deal. 
Boscia, said the deal has a $300 million break-up fee, which will likely prevent other offers. The deal is expected 
to close in the first quarter of 2006. 
He said the combined company's risk profile would be more attractive than the two companies alone and that 
earnings will be more stable and diversified. He said the company plans no changes to its structure. 
But Jefferson-Pilot's president, Dennis Glass, who will serve as president and chief operating officer of the 
combined company, said he expects a 10% head-count reduction. 
The combined company's return on equity will start out at about 12%, but will rise into the teens, Boscia said. 
According to the companies, the merger will combine two complementary distribution networks with little overlap, 
while allowing the company to save about $180 million pretax a year beginning in 2008 from lower overhead 
costs. It also allows for greater breadth of product offerings. The combined company will be the fifth largest in 
total life insurance sales. 
Shares of Lincoln National recently were down 62 cents, or 1.2%, to $50.11. Jefferson-Pilot shares were up 
$3.63, or 7.2%, to $54.42.

PHILADELPHIA (Dow Jones)--Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) confirmed it agreed to acquire Jefferson-Pilot Corp. 
(JP) for about $7.5 billion in cash and stock, creating an insurance and financial player with market capitalization 
nearing $16 billion. 
The Wall Street Journal reported in its Monday editions that a merger agreement was imminent after talks 
intensified over the weekend. 
In a joint press release Monday, the two insurers said the purchase price gives Jefferson holders an 11% 
premium over the average closing price of each company's stock over the past month. 
Lincoln agreed to pay 1.0906 shares or $55.96 in cash for each Jefferson share, with aggregate cash payment 
totaling $1.8 billion. [ 10-10-05 0714ET ] 
Lincoln National expects to book a pretax "implementation" charge of $180 million, spread out over the two years 
following final approval. 
The companies anticipate saving about $180 million pretax a year starting in 2008, primarily from lower overhead 
costs. For the first 12 months after closing, savings are expected at 50% of that total; for the second year, the 
companies put the savings at 80%. 
The deal is expected to add "modestly" to operating earnings in the the first year, before boosting that figure by 
6% to 7% by the end of 2007. 
Following the deal, Jefferson-Pilot, of Greensboro, N.C., will hold 39% of the combined company. [ 10-10-05 
0727ET ] 
Lincoln National Chairman and Chief Executive Jon Boscia was named chairman and chief executive of the 
combined company. Dennis Glass, president and chief executive at Jefferson-Pilot, will take over as president

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) _ Insurance provider Lincoln National Corp. agreed Monday to acquire Jefferson-Pilot 
Corp. for about $7.5 billion US in cash and stock. Jefferson-Pilot's shares rose nearly seven per cent in stock 
trading. 
The deal would combine Lincoln's strengths in life and annuities products with Greensboro, N.C.-based Jefferson 
Pilot's sizable presence in fixed and variable universal life and fixed annuities, including equity-indexed annuities 
and other insurance, the companies said in a statement. 
The deal, expected to close in the first quarter of 2006, will make Lincoln National the top-ranked seller of 
universal life product sales, as well as a leading player in group disability sales and retirement plan assets, the 
companies said. 
In a conference call following the announcement, executives predicted annual cost savings of about $180 million 
after the two companies are combined. 
``These two companies are a perfect fit,'' said Lincoln National chief executive and chairman Jon Boscia, who 
will have the same role for the combined company. ``I know you hear this all time, but in this case, it's really true.'' 
Besides the cost savings, Lincoln National said the acquisition should immediately add to its operating profits and 
build to about six per cent or seven per cent growth by the end of 2007. 
The combined company will be headquartered in Philadelphia while Greensboro will be the major centre of 
operations for life insurance. Fort Wayne, Ind., will be the centre for the company's annuity operations, the 
companies said. 
While possible job reductions were not specifically discussed, the companies said in a statement that they 
planned to share services and consolidate some functions to save money. 
``It would be impossible to have a merger of this size without some kind of impact (on jobs),'' said Lincoln National 
spokesman Tom Johnson. 
Lincoln National has no immediate plans for Jefferson Pilot Communications, a unit that owns and operates 
three television stations, 18 radio stations and the Jefferson Pilot Sports production and syndication business. 
Instead, company officials focused on the core business lines. 
``This will create one of the largest publicly traded life insurance companies in the U.S.,'' Boscia said. ``This 
critical mass is becoming an increasingly important factor in achieving success in this industry.'' 
Cost savings were less of a motivation for the deal than the opportunity to increase sales, said Jefferson Pilot 
CEO Dennis Glass, who will become president and chief operating officer of the new company. 
The 15-member board of directors of the combined company will comprise eight Lincoln members and seven 
Jefferson Pilot members. Jefferson Pilot shareholders will own roughly 39 per cent of the combined company. 
Under terms of the deal, Jefferson Pilot shareholders will receive 1.0906 Lincoln shares, a cash payment or a 
combination of shares and cash valued at $55.48 for each Jefferson Pilot share they own. 
The combination offer represents a 9.2 per cent premium over Jefferson's Friday closing price of $50.79 on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

Jefferson Pilot shares rose $3.46, or 6.8 per cent, to $54.25 in Monday trading, while Lincoln National shares 
lost 91 cents to $49.82. 
The deal is expected to close in early 2006, pending shareholder approval on both sides and other customary 
conditions.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Lincoln National Corp. said Monday it will acquire rival Jefferson-Pilot Corp. for about 
$7.5 billion in cash and stock, as the two century-old companies create what executives said would be one of the 
largest publicly traded life insurance companies in the U.S. 
The buyer, which will retain the Lincoln National and Lincoln Financial Group names, will be the nation's largest 
seller of universal life insurance products and a leader in group disability insurance and retirement plan assets, 
the companies said. 
The deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2006 after shareholder and regulatory approval 
Executives predicted annual cost savings of about $180 million after the two companies are combined. Lincoln 
National has annual sales of $5.4 billion, while Jefferson-Pilot has annual sales of $4.1 billion. 
"It makes perfect sense and it's just what the doctor ordered," analyst Tamara Kravec, who follows both 
companies for Bank of America Securities LLC, wrote to investors after the announcement. 
"Given the challenging operating environment for life insurers, we believe this merger makes perfect sense," she 
wrote. "The products and distribution channels of both companies are complementary and there is little overlap." 
In an interview, Kravec compared the deal to MetLife Inc.'s $11.5 billion purchase of Citigroup Inc.'s Travelers Life 
& Annuity and most of Citigroup's international insurance business earlier this year. 
"From a strategic sense, they both were in a search for scale and size," she said. "Scale is more important than it 
used to be. Shelf space is dwindling and you need to be in the top five to get market share." 
The deal would combine Lincoln's strengths in life and annuities products with Jefferson-Pilot's sizable presence 
in fixed and variable universal life and fixed annuities, including equity-indexed annuities and other insurance, the 
companies said. 
Jon Boscia, Lincoln National's chief executive officer and chairman, who will hold the same role at the combined 
companies, called the two firms "a perfect fit." 
"I know you hear this all time, but in this case, it's really true," Boscia said. 
With about 5,200 employees, Lincoln National is larger than Jefferson-Pilot, which has 4,400 employees. But 
Jefferson-Pilot spokesman Paul Mason said the merger could bring more jobs to Greensboro, the central North 
Carolina city that will become the "center of operations" for the company's life insurance business. Mason said 
that business will grow significantly as a result of the merger. 
"We anticipate several hundred new jobs in Greensboro over the next few years," he said. 
The combined company will be headquartered in Philadelphia, with Fort Wayne, Ind., becoming the center of the 
company's annuity business. 
Jefferson-Pilot's shares rose $3.02, or nearly 6 percent, to close at $53.81 in the New York Stock Exchange. 
Lincoln National's shares lost $1.54, or 3 percent, to finish at $49.19 on the NYSE.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Lincoln National Corp. said Monday it will acquire rival Jefferson-Pilot Corp. for about 
$7.5 billion in cash and stock, as the two century-old companies create what executives said would be one of the 
largest publicly traded life insurance companies in the U.S. 
The buyer, which will retain the Lincoln National and Lincoln Financial Group names, will be the nation's largest 
seller of universal life insurance products and a leader in group disability insurance and retirement plan assets, 
the companies said. 
The deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2006 after shareholder and regulatory approval 
Executives predicted annual cost savings of about $180 million after the two companies are combined. Lincoln 
National has annual sales of $5.4 billion, while Jefferson-Pilot has annual sales of $4.1 billion. 
"It makes perfect sense and it's just what the doctor ordered," analyst Tamara Kravec, who follows both 
companies for Bank of America Securities LLC, wrote to investors after the announcement. 
"Given the challenging operating environment for life insurers, we believe this merger makes perfect sense," she 
wrote. "The products and distribution channels of both companies are complementary and there is little overlap." 
In an interview, Kravec compared the deal to MetLife Inc.'s $11.5 billion purchase of Citigroup Inc.'s Travelers Life 
& Annuity and most of Citigroup's international insurance business earlier this year. 
"From a strategic sense, they both were in a search for scale and size," she said. "Scale is more important than it 
used to be. Shelf space is dwindling and you need to be in the top five to get market share." 
The deal would combine Lincoln's strengths in life and annuities products with Jefferson-Pilot's sizable presence 
in fixed and variable universal life and fixed annuities, including equity-indexed annuities and other insurance, the 
companies said. 
Jon Boscia, Lincoln National's chief executive officer and chairman, who will hold the same role at the combined 
companies, called the two firms "a perfect fit." 
"I know you hear this all time, but in this case, it's really true," Boscia said. 
With about 5,200 employees, Lincoln National is larger than Jefferson-Pilot, which has 4,400 employees. But 
Jefferson-Pilot spokesman Paul Mason said the merger could bring more jobs to Greensboro, the central North 
Carolina city that will become the "center of operations" for the company's life insurance business. Mason said 
that business will grow significantly as a result of the merger. 
"We anticipate several hundred new jobs in Greensboro over the next few years," he said. 
The combined company will be headquartered in Philadelphia, with Fort Wayne, Ind., becoming the center of the 
company's annuity business. 
Jefferson-Pilot's shares rose $3.02, or nearly 6 percent, to close at $53.81 in the New York Stock Exchange. 
Lincoln National's shares lost $1.54, or 3 percent, to finish at $49.19 on the NYSE.

Besides the cost savings, Lincoln National said the acquisition should immediately boost its operating earnings, 
with the merged company experiencing annual growth of 6 to 7 percent by the end of 2007. 
While job reductions were not specifically discussed Monday, the companies said in a statement they planned to 
share services and consolidate some functions to save money. "It would be impossible to have a merger of this 
size without some kind of impact (on jobs)," said Lincoln National spokesman Tom Johnson. 
Lincoln National has no immediate plans for Jefferson-Pilot Communications, a unit that owns and operates 
three television stations, 18 radio stations and a sports production and syndication business. Executives said they 
focused on the companies' core businesses during buyout talks. 
"This will create one of the largest publicly traded life insurance companies in the U.S.," Boscia said. "This critical 
mass is becoming an increasingly important factor in achieving success in this industry." 
Cost savings were less of a motivation for the deal than the opportunity to increase sales, said Jefferson-Pilot 
CEO Dennis Glass, who will become president and chief operating officer. 
The 15-member board of directors of the combined company will comprise eight Lincoln members and seven 
Jefferson-Pilot members. Jefferson-Pilot shareholders will own roughly 39 percent of the combined company. 
Under terms of the deal, Jefferson-Pilot shareholders will receive 1.0906 Lincoln shares, a cash payment or a 
combination of shares and cash valued at $55.48 for each Jefferson-Pilot share they own. 
The combination offer represents a 9.2 percent premium over Jefferson's Friday closing price of $50.79 on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

NEW YORK (AP) - Insurance provider Lincoln National Corp. on Monday said it has agreed to acquire insurer 
Jefferson-Pilot Corp. for cash and stock worth $7.5 billion, in a deal that will create one of the country's biggest 
public life insurance companies. 
Under terms of the deal, Jefferson Pilot shareholders will receive 1.0906 Lincoln shares or $55.96 in cash for 
each share they own, subject to proration. 
Jefferson Pilot shareholders can choose up to receive up to an aggregate $1.8 billion in cash, representing a 
potential cash and stock payment of $55.48 per share based on Lincoln's Oct. 7 closing price. 
The offer price represents a 10 percent premium over Jefferson's Friday closing price of $50.79 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Jefferson Pilot shares rose $3.71, or 7.3 percent, to $54.50 in premarket trading, while Lincoln 
National shares added $1.27, or 2.5 percent, to $52. 
The newly created company combines Lincoln's strengths in life and annuities products with Jefferson Pilot's 
sizable presence in fixed and variable universal life and fixed annuities, including equity-indexed annuities and 
other insurance. The companies said the deal will make Lincoln National the top-ranked seller of universal life 
product sales, as well as a leading player in group disability sales and retirement plan assets. 
Lincoln National Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Jon Boscia will serve as chairman and CEO of the newly 
combined company, while Jefferson Pilot CEO Dennis Glass will serve as president and chief operating officer 
and as a member of the board. 
The 15-member board of directors of the combined company will comprise eight Lincoln members and seven 
Jefferson Pilot members. Jefferson Pilot shareholders will own roughly 39 percent of the combined company. 
The deal is expected to close in next year's first quarter, pending shareholder approval on both sides and other 
customary conditions.

U.S. Insurers Balk At Recent Talk Of Takeover Trend --- Young CEOs Seem Reluctant To Give Up Control of Firms 
U.S. Insurers Balk At Recent Talk Of Takeover Trend --- Young CEOs Seem Reluctant To Give Up Control 
of Firms

Now that the smoke has cleared from the $23 billion (26.77 billion euro) bidding duel over life insurer American 
General, the question becomes, "Who's next?" 
So far, the response from a few oft-mentioned insurance takeover targets has been, "Not us." 
Analysts say the companies, including Hartford Financial Services Group, John Hancock Financial Services and 
Lincoln National, aren't just playing coy. One big reason is that all three are run by young chiefs who aren't in a 
hurry to give up control. Ramani Ayer of Hartford is 53, Hancock's David D'Alessandro is 50, and Jon Boscia of 
Lincoln is 49. 
Their reluctance to sell could delay the pace of acquisitions -- but many others are betting it also could lead to 
relatively high-premium bids for these companies as acquisitive U.S. banking and European financial-service 
giants seek to get these CEOs' attention and compete for the few remaining large insurance properties. "If you're 
a $100 billion company buying a $10 billion company, you can pay a big premium and the CEO's role (in the 
takeover) is diminished" because he can't stand in the way of the company's board of directors, says Lanny 
Thorndike, who runs Century Shares Trust mutual fund, which specializes in financial-services stocks. 
Hartford, Hancock and Lincoln are of a size -- $9 billion to $16 billion in market capitalization -- considered 
desirable by potential acquirers. But trying to play this consolidation trend could prove risky in the short term. 
Analysts generally predict a tough year for U.S. life-insurance stocks. Concerns abound that estate-tax reform 
could hurt sales of the industry's tax-advantaged products, and a rocky stock market already has been crimping 
profits from market-linked products, including mutual funds, annuities and variable life insurance. 
But more consolidation seems a given. Since 1997, $111.7 billion in life-insurance deals have been signed, 
compared with $34.1 billion between 1990 and 1996. And the list of potential acquirers remains long. It includes 
Citigroup, Wells Fargo and FleetBoston Financial in the U.S., as well as Allianz in Germany, AXA in France and 
Aegon and ING Groep of the Netherlands. All are eager to gain more access to Americans as they prepare 
retirement nest eggs. 
Investors also are wondering about the next move for British Prudential PLC, which lost out to American 
International Group in the contest for American General but got a $600 million breakup fee. In recent days, 
speculation that Prudential was turning its attention to Jefferson-Pilot caused a spike in trading of call options of 
the Greensboro, North Carolina, company, a big seller of annuities and life insurance. 
Prudential also has been pegged as a possible buyer of Philadelphia-based Lincoln National, but a spokesman 
says Prudential, not related to Prudential Insurance Co. of America, isn't in a rush to make its next move. 
Both Jefferson-Pilot and Lincoln National declined to comment on takeover speculation. 
More generally, Lincoln's Mr. Boscia acknowledges his company is at the top of a lot of acquirers' "wish lists," 
calling this status "the ultimate corporate compliment." 
That said, he maintains Lincoln has what a financial-services firm needs to remain independent, including scale 
and brand recognition. The company is the third-largest seller of variable annuities, ranks seventh in 
life-insurance sales and has a big mutual-funds operation.

John Hancock's Mr. D'Alessandro has in the recent past indicated a willingness to talk to potential acquirers, but 
at the company's annual shareholders meeting in Boston earlier this month, he cited antitakeover provisions the 
company enjoys, saying, "This company is not for sale." 
A Hartford spokeswoman, meanwhile, says the Hartford, Connecticut, firm, one of the biggest sellers of variable 
annuities in the U.S., plans to be on the other end of the acquisition game. "The Hartford will emerge as a winner 
in a consolidating global business," she says. "We're a natural consolidator in the industry." 
But some analysts and investors see it differently. "We believe it is more a matter of time before many of the U.S. 
life insurers become divisions of much larger financial-services firms," says Jason Zucker, an insurance analyst 
with Banc of America Securities. "There is simply too much money chasing only a few choice companies. 
In addition, many of those companies will find it increasingly expensive to compete in a market dominated by 
giants, with their global brands, huge technology budgets and better economies of scale."

Adds Margaret Alexandre Jacobsen, a money manager at hedge fund Renaissance Fund Advisors: "It's fairly 
obvious that all these companies need to merge. . . . When you start to see a competitor as formidable as 
American General capitulate, you start to rethink your strategy." 
Ms. Jacobsen trades in and out of the life stocks, but points to Jefferson-Pilot as "one to own," both because it 
has steady earnings and "appears to be available" for acquisition, referring to persistent whispers in the market 
that the company is for sale. "Look at JP's stock," she says. "It goes up a bit every day." Specifically, it's up 38% 
since March of last year; at 4 p.m. Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the shares were down 
12 cents to $46.64, amid a 1.1% retreat by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
