CLEVELAND, June 15 (Reuters) - KeyCorp's proposed acquisition of McDonald & Co. Investments Inc. could 
involve a charge in the fourth quarter of 1998, but any charge is not likely to be significant, said Henry Meyer, 
KeyCorp president and chief operating officer. 
"I'm not even sure there will be a specific charge that we could not absorb," he told a news conference. 
Earlier today, KeyCorp agreed to acquire McDonald, an investment banking and securities brokerage company, 
in a transaction valued at $653 million. 
Meyer said "significant" could be anything over $20 million. He said the company may want to take a charge in 
the fourth quarter "just to get the cost behind us." 
He said the transaction could be slightly dilutive to earnings in 1998 if charges are taken in the fourth quarter. 
KeyCorp expects the deal to be accretive to earnings in 1999. 
KeyCorp chairman and chief executive Robert Gillespie said he expects McDonald and Co to account for 20 
percent of its earnings in three to four years. 
He said he expects earnings from insurance operations, which will be part of the McDonald operation, also will 
account for 20 percent of earnings. 
McDonald & Co. will operate under the name McDonald-Key Investments as the capital markets group. 
Gillespie said the transaction was driven by the potential for revenue rather than cost efficiencies, which have 
characterised many banking combinations. 
He said that while there may be some overlap in some jobs, the company would try to reassign people within the 
organisation. 
"Our hope is for double-digit growth," he said. 
William Summers, president and chief executive of McDonald & Co., said a number of McDonald employees will 
receive retention incentives to limit disruption of client services while the two combine. 
He said this would apply to some 200-plus employees throughout McDonald and Co. 
Gillespie said KeyCorp could make other acquisitions but would also focus on acquiring the right people to make 
these new lines of its business grow at the 15 to 20 percent rates he looks for.

CLEVELAND, June 15 (Reuters) - Financial services giant KeyCorp said on Monday it agreed to acquire 
McDonald & Co. Investments Inc. , an investment banking and brokerage business, in a deal worth $653 million. 
The deal, which comes amid a flurry of combinations between banks and brokers, expands KeyCorp's investment 
banking operations and paves the way for KeyCorp to pursue an acquisition in the insurance industry. 
"McDonald & Co. is a perfect strategic fit for KeyCorp," said KeyCorp Chairman Robert Gillespie. "The next 
frontier is insurance." 
Although the deal is smaller than similar bank-broker combinations, such as Bankers Trust New York Corp.'s 
acquisition of Alex. Brown and Sons, it provides KeyCorp with a base from which to develop investment banking 
services, analysts said. 
The acquisition will add 350 retail brokers to KeyCorp's 290, 90 investment bankers to its 70, 147 capital markets 
professionals to its 110 and 30 research analysts to its 12. 
The companies said the short-term job impact should be minimal and in the long term the combination should 
create additional jobs. 
"This is a way for them to grow their fee income, which they want to increase as a percentage of total revenue," 
said Diane Yates, an analyst at A.G. Edwards. 
She said KeyCorp's goal is for fee income to account for 50 percent of its revenues. It currently represents 34 
percent and will reach 40 percent when the acquisition is completed, which is expected in the fourth quarter of 
1998. 
KeyCorp has been reinventing itself over the past few years, trading in its commercial banking persona for that of 
a financial services company. 
Along the way it dropped its geographic structure and organised itself around four business lines: Corporate 
Capital, Consumer Finance, Capital Partners and its Community Bank. 
McDonald will operate under a new Key Capital Partners unit as McDonald-Key Investments. William Summers, 
president and chief executive of McDonald, will remain at the helm as chairman and chief executive. 
He will also serve as chairman of the new Key Capital Partners. 
Gillespie said he expects the capital markets operations to account for about 20 percent of revenue in the next 
three to four years and would expect the same for its insurance operations, which it is currently developing. 
To ensure continuity and keep McDonald's top employees about 200 retention incentives will be offered, 
Summers told a news conference. 
In addition, he said the company has spotted 11 top producers they believe are vital to the organisation. 
Analysts said the company will offer three-year contracts to nine of those 11 and five-year contracts to 
McDonald's two top executives.

The whole package would total $68 million, of which $30 million will be in cash over three years and the other $38 
million in KeyCorp stock options, KeyCorp said. 
KeyCorp was not immediately available to comment on the packages. 
Rumours had surfaced some months ago that KeyCorp was interested in McDonald and Co. but that the highly 
regarded broker wanted to maintain its independence. 
"I guess they wanted to remain independent, but with all the consolidation they had to do something," said Arthur 
Stupay, an analyst at SBK-Brooks Investment Co. 
Analysts agree that while it may be fashionable for banks to acquire brokerages, how well the two will fit remains 
to be seen. 
"Full financial services is the name of the game, but the success of these combinations is still unproven," said 
A.G. Edwards' Yates.
