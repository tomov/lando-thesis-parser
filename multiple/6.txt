DENVER _ Denver-based Newmont Mining Corp. (NYSE:NEM) has received approval from Industry Canada for 
its $1.5-billion acquisition of Miramar Mining Corp. (TSX:MAE). 
Industry Minister Jim Prentice said Tuesday he is satisfied that the deal ``is likely to be of net benefit to Canada'' 
as required under the Investment Canada Act. 
Vancouver's Miramar owns the Hope Bay project in Nunavut, one of the largest undeveloped gold sites in North 
America. 
``With the necessary regulatory approvals from the Canadian authorities, we look forward to completing this 
investment and focusing on the disciplined development of the Hope Bay Project for the benefit of Newmont's 
shareholders, Nunavut and the communities near Hope Bay,'' Newmont chief executive Richard O'Brien said in 
a release. 
The acquisition would give Denver-headquartered Newmont, the world's second-largest gold company after 
Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp. (TSX:ABX), a new foothold in Nunavut's core mining district and boost 
Newmont's global reserves, and is part of an industry-wide trend toward consolidation. 
The Hope Bay gold belt is believed to hold at least nine million ounces of gold. 
Miramar's board has said it unanimously supports the offer of $6.25 per share in cash. The offer made in October 
expires at 5 p.m. ET on Friday. It requires that at least two-thirds of Miramar's stock is tendered to the bid. 
Miramar shares were up three cents at $6.20 in afternoon trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

and non-core assets from its parent. 
Newmont announced this year that it would spin off the assets, but said at the time that an IPO was only one of a 
few possible options for the new company. 
The management team of Franco-Nevada is formed primarily from employees of Newmont's merchant-banking 
segment, including David Harquail, who will serve as chief executive and a director of Franco-Nevada. 
Management and directors of Franco -- which include David Peterson, a former Ontario premier, and Randall 
Oliphant, a former Barrick Gold CEO -- have agreed to subscribe for approximately 7.7% of the pro-forma shares 
outstanding of Franco-Nevada. 
"The IPO of Franco-Nevada will allow investors the opportunity to participate in what we believe to be one of the 
largest holdings of precious metal and resource royalties in a publicly-listed company," Pierre Lassonde, the 
chairman of Franco-Nevada, said in a statement. 
The IPO is still expected to top $1-billion and will hit the market next month. 
Newmont ultimately decided to spin off Franco-Nevada after companies like International Royalty were awarded 
strong valuations from the market in IPOs, suggesting it would offer better value than private transactions. 
The royalty structure can work in the mining industry because it provides diversified exposure to commodities 
without the operating risk. It has become more appealing in recent years as both prices and project costs spiralled 
higher. 
The only problem with royalty firms, industry experts have said, is that it can be difficult to grow them once they 
reach a certain size. That is an issue Franco-Nevada faced before being bought in 2002. 
However, with gold prices more than doubling in the past five years, the new company could potentially have a lot 
more investment opportunities, sources said. 
For Newmont, the sale is a key part of the company's strategy to get rid of noncore businesses and focus on 
mining assets that are more levered to the price of gold. New chief executive Richard O'Brien made another key 
move in that direction in September by striking a $1.5-billion deal to buy Miramar Mining Corp.

Newmont Mining agreed to buy Canadian gold company Miramar Mining for $1.52 billion as the Denver-based 
company tries to address its shrinking mineral reserves. Last month, Newmont warned of higher costs and 
dwindling reserves from its older, more tapped-out mines and said it isn't finding new lodes fast enough to keep 
up with its production rates. The deal may offer a way out of that cycle, as Vancouver-based Miramar controls the 
Hope Bay Project in Canada's Nunavut Territory, one of the largest undeveloped gold projects in North America. 
The two companies have had a relationship for some time. "We made an initial investment in Miramar in 2005 
because we saw the potential strategic opportunity offered by the Hope Bay Project as part of our broader 
exploration and growth portfolio," says Newmont's CEO, Richard O'Brien. "We have been impressed with the 
progress of the Hope Bay Project since that time, and believe that, as a result of its scale, the true potential of the 
project can best be realized with the additional expertise and resources of a global gold company like Newmont."

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS 
Newmont Mining will acquire Miramar Mining for $1.53 billion. 
The deal will give Denver, CO-based Newmont a 100 percent stake in Miramar's Hope Bay project. The Hope 
Bay project is about 161 km (100 miles) north of the Arctic Circle. The largely unexplored, but promising field is 
estimated to contain at least 279 t (9 million oz) of gold. 
Newmont, the world's secondlargest gold producer, will pay $6.36 per share for Miramar, a 20-percent premium 
over the Vancouver, British Columbia-based company's closing stock price of $5.29 on Oct. 5. The deal, which 
has a $42.1-million breakup fee, is expected to close in about two months. 
Hope Bay is Miramar's biggest asset and may be viewed by Newmont as lower risk than mining outside of North 
America. Newmont, which has about 15,000 employees and $5 billion in annual revenues, has operations in 
Australia, Ghana, Indonesia, Peru and the U.S. 
Newmont officials described Hope Bay as being one of the top known but undeveloped gold deposits in the world. 
Newmont chief executive officer, Richard O'Brien, said he was impressed with Miramar's progress in exploring 
the 1,554 km^sup 2^ (600-sq-mile) area in the remote Nunavit Territory. 
Miramar executive vice chairman, David Fennell, said barges with equipment are headed to the Arctic Coast and 
that Miramar will begin construction later this year on the underground Doris North Mine. That is the first of three 
sites identified for production. He said the company has construction permits and soon will have operating 
permits. 
Newmont paid $36 million for 8.4 percent of Miramar's common shares in 2005. 
"We made an initial investment in Miramar in 2005 because we saw the potential strategic opportunity offered by 
the Hope Bay project as part of our broader exploration and growth portfolio," O'Brien said in a statement. "We 
have been impressed with the progress of the project since that time, and believe that, as a result of its scale, the 
true potential of the project can best be realized with the additional expertise and resources of a global gold 
company like Newmont. Consistent with our strategic focus on exploration and project development, this 
transaction represents the next logical step for this world-class resource. This transaction further emphasizes our 
focus on our core gold business while providing opportunities for sustainable, lower cost production and future 
reserve replacement."

Franco-Nevada asset sale sure to spark interest

Newmont Mining Corp. has left the door open for rival companies to buy its royalty assets as it prepares to sell 
them in Franco-Nevada Corp.' s initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange, a deal that should be 
complete by the end of the year. 
The royalty portfolio, which encompasses about 300 mining and oil and gas properties, includes stakes in two 
flagship assets: Barrick Gold Corp.'s Goldstrike property, and Stillwater Mining Co.'s Stillwater property. Both 
Barrick and Stillwater are considered to be potential buyers of those royalties. 
"Any time you can remove an underlying royalty that is burdensome, you're better off," one analyst said. "But I bet 
the market will pay more for that royalty stream than Barrick will." 
The Franco-Nevada assets are also expected to generate interest from royalty-focused companies such as Royal 
Gold Inc. and International Royalty Corp. 
Newmont bought Franco-Nevada, a company founded by Pierre Lassonde and Seymour Schulich, in 2002 for 
about $2.9-billion, and the assets proved to be extremely profitable. The company that is being spun off is 
smaller, as the royalties on Newmont properties will not be included. 
It also will not have large equity positions that were in the original Franco-Nevada, and it will have more debt and 
less cash. 
The IPO is still expected to top $1-billion. 
Newmont ultimately decided to spin off Franco-Nevada after companies like International Royalty were awarded 
strong valuations from the market in IPOs, suggesting that it would offer better value than private transactions. 
The royalty structure can work in the mining industry because it provides diversified exposure to commodities 
without the operating risk. It has become more appealing in recent years as both prices and project costs spiralled 
higher. 
The only problem with royalty firms, industry experts said yesterday, is that it can be difficult to grow them once 
they reach a certain size. That is an issue Franco-Nevada faced before being bought in 2002. 
However, with gold prices more than doubling in the past five years, the new company could potentially have a lot 
more investment opportunities, sources said. 
For Newmont, the sale is a key part of the company's strategy to get rid of non-core businesses and focus on 
mining assets that are more levered to the price of gold. New chief executive Richard O'Brien made another key 
move in that direction last month by striking a $1.5-billion deal to buy Miramar Mining Corp. 
"It's the right direction for the company to go. I think it's more appropriate for a senior miner to be mining," said 
Mark Smith, an analyst at Dundee Securities. 
With Mr. Lassonde as president, Newmont had more of an investment philosophy where it bought stakes in other 
companies. He has been named chairman of the new Franco-Nevada. David Harquail, who was a senior 
executive at Franco-Nevada and Newmont, will return as chief executive.

At www.pinnacledigest.com we study the markets, tirelessly searching for viable investments and companies with 
news we believe to be influential to their development. Our site is a true investor community, built for the retail 
investor. 
Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) experienced a slight rise in share value Thursday combined with over 
11.3 million shares traded. On October 9th they and Miramar Mining Corp. announced that they have entered 
into a definitive support agreement that provides for the acquisition by Newmont, with the unanimous support of 
the Miramar board of directors, of all the outstanding common shares of Miramar for C$6.25 cash per common 
share. This news has justified a review by our team at PinnacleDigest as we believe it will have a direct influence 
over their short and long term direction. To follow up with Newmont Mining continue with this article, or visit our 
informative and easy access online financial magazine at www.pinnacledigest.com to read the article in its 
entirety. 
At PinnacleDigest we are currently focused on the small to mid cap markets. We are focused on companies 
specifically focused in the mining and energy based sectors operating within North America. Our main goal has 
and will always be to enhance our members approach to the market, while adding additional research. 
U.S. stocks have risen for four straight weeks. The Dow hit an intraday record before falling 63.57 points on the 
day. The Dow Average closed at 14.015.12 while the S&P as well rose to a record early in the day, but closed 
down 8.06 points to 1554.41. All in all the markets have emerged from the beating they were dealt this summer at 
the behest of the mortgage meltdown and a continually sliding housing market. US markets capped the largest 
September advance in 8 years after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. 
The Fed is expected to cut rates once more and this is fueling positive sentiment in the markets currently. Ed 
Peters the Chief Investment Officer at PanAgora Asset Management in Boston made a comment we agree with 
strongly at PinnacleDigest. He stated, "Commodities will continue rising in price, lifting shares of their producers, 
because the rate cut may boost inflation." The fear surrounding the spread of the housing crisis was quelled for 
the moment. 
We have our eye on the oil and gas sector at PinnacleDigest as the price of oil continues to trade at historically 
high levels. Canadian stocks have put together a very nice rally of late. We reviewed the details of this rise in this 
week's newsletter found under our "Weekly Volume" section. The TSX Composite fell 46.75 points Thursday. The 
index closed at 14229.44. 
The markets have clearly regained stability for the moment and have been moving in a very positive direction 
lately, hovering around all time highs. We will be continuing to closely monitor the financial sector as many issues 
surrounding the mortgage crisis have yet to be dealt with. 
At PinnacleDigest we have recently announced two new featured companies's trading in the mining and oil and 
gas industries. We invite you to visit our multi-purpose online financial magazine to learn more about the 
company featured in this article and to find out exactly what our expanding online financial magazine has to offer. 
In respect to Newmont Mining we are interested in their most recent development, but even more specifically the 
trend of the sector influencing their ultimate success. Richard O'Brien the CEO and President of Newmont stated 
that, "We made an initial investment in Miramar in 2005 because we saw the potential strategic opportunity

NEWMONT TO ACQUIRE MIRAMAR MINING FOR C$6.25 CASH PER SHARE; MIRAMAR BOARD TO 
UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND OFFER DENVER, Colorado and Vancouver, British Columbia, October 9, 2007 
– Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) and Miramar Mining Corporation (TSX: MAE, AMEX: MNG) 
announced today that they have entered into a definitive support agreement that provides for the acquisition by 
Newmont, with the unanimous support of the Miramar board of directors, of all the outstanding common shares of 
Miramar for C$6.25 cash per common share. The acquisition will be effected through a take-over bid, the full 
details of which will be contained in Newmont’s take-over bid circular that is expected to be mailed to Miramar 
shareholders by the end of October. The transaction values Miramar at approximately C$1.5 billion on a 
fully-diluted basis. The offer represents a premium of approximately 29% over Miramar’s 20-day volume 
weighted average trading price on the TSX through October 5, 2007. 
The board of directors of Miramar has unanimously determined that the offer to be made by Newmont is fair and 
that it will recommend that shareholders tender to the offer. Miramar has received opinions from BMO Capital 
Markets and Paradigm Capital Inc. that, subject to the limitations and qualifications stated in such opinions, the 
consideration to be received under the offer is fair, from a financial point of view, to Miramar shareholders. All of 
the directors and senior officers of Miramar have entered into written agreements to accept Newmont’s offer and 
to tender their shares to the take-over bid. Richard O’Brien, Chief Executive Officer and President of Newmont, 
said, “We made an initial investment in Miramar in 2005 because we saw the potential strategic opportunity 
offered by the Hope Bay Project as part of our broader exploration and growth portfolio. We have been impressed 
with the progress of the Project since that time, and believe that, as a result of its scale, the true potential of the 
Project can best be realized with the additional expertise and resources of a global gold company like Newmont. 
Consistent with our strategic focus on exploration and project development, this transaction represents the next 
logical step for this world class resource. This transaction further emphasizes our focus on our core gold business 
while providing opportunities for sustainable, lower cost production and future reserve replacement.” The strategic 
benefits offered by this transaction include: 
- the opportunity for Newmont to establish a new, core mining district in 
the Nunavut
Territory of Canada; 
- the opportunity for Newmont’s exploration and project development teams 
to focus 
on a long-term deposit with competitive operating costs that is one of 
the top known, 
undeveloped gold deposits globally; 
- the opportunity to reduce the technical risk associated with the Project 
using 
Newmont’s historic investment in and understanding of the Hope Bay 
Project, and; 
Page 1 of 3 
- the opportunity for Newmont to control and explore a roughly 80 by 20 
kilometer 
greenstone belt with substantial exploration potential located in a 
AAA-rated country. 
Tony Walsh, President and Chief Executive Officer of Miramar said, “We believe Newmont’s offer takes into 
account the value of the existing resources at Hope Bay along with the significant upside potential. I firmly believe 
this is a world class project and that its value will continue to be realized under the direction of Newmont, a world 
class gold mining company.” Full details of the offer will be included in the formal offer and take-over bid circular 
that is expected to be mailed to Miramar shareholders by the end of October. Newmont’s take-over bid circular 
will be accompanied by Miramar’s directors’ circular, which will provide shareholders of Miramar with, among

other things, the rationale for the unanimous recommendation of the Miramar board that shareholders accept 
Newmont’s offer. Newmont’s obligation to acquire shares pursuant to the offer will be subject to certain customary 
conditions, including there having been validly deposited at the expiry of the offer a number of common shares of 
Miramar that, together with the common shares held by Newmont and its affiliates, constitutes at least 66 2/3% of 
the common shares of Miramar then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (disregarding shares that may be 
acquired by Newmont pursuant to warrants that it owns). Newmont currently holds an approximately 8.4% basic 
and 15.0% fully-diluted common share interest in Miramar. Newmont also announced that it has enhanced its 
existing financing capacity with a US$1.3 billion underwritten financing commitment from JPMorgan and Citi that 
is in addition to approximately US$1.5 billion in available capacity under its current revolving credit facility. 
Newmont has engaged Genuity Capital Markets as its financial advisor and Citi and JPMorgan as co-advisors, 
and engaged Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Goodmans LLP as its legal advisors in connection with the 
transaction. Miramar has engaged BMO Capital Markets as its sole financial advisor, and Gowling Lafleur 
Henderson LLP and Dorsey & Whitney LLP as its legal advisors in connection with the transaction. About

companies in the world. Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, the company employs approximately 15,000 people,

Newmont Mining to buy Miramar to replenish its gold stockpiles 
International Investor 
Newmont Mining to buy Miramar to replenish its gold stockpiles 
By Laura Mandaro

10 October 2007

WSJE

(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Newmont Mining Corp., seeking to replenish its thinning gold stockpiles, agreed to buy Canadian gold explorer 
Miramar Mining Corp. in a transaction that values Miramar at C$1.5 billion (US$1.52 billion). 
The proposed C$6.25-a-share acquisition would bring Denver-based Newmont a source of future gold production 
and extend its mining assets in a politically stable country. Miramar is based in North Vancouver, British 
Columbia. The per-share price represents a 20% premium to Miramar's closing stock price of C$5.19 on Friday. 
Canadian markets were closed Monday for a holiday. 
Global depletion of reserves has led producers to stake claims in countries where political risk, from mine 
seizures to war, is elevated. Newmont took an initial stake in Miramar two years ago. 
Miramar's main asset is its Hope Bay Project in the Nunavut Territory of Canada. The project, which extends over 
1,000 square kilometers, is one of the top known, undeveloped gold deposits globally, according to Newmont. 
"This transaction further emphasizes our focus on our core gold business while providing opportunities for 
sustainable, lower-cost production and future reserve replacement," said Richard O'Brien, Newmont's chief 
executive.

Newmont Mining Corp. has high hopes for Canada's Hope Bay gold play in Nunavut, which it will control once 
yesterday's $1.5 billion deal to acquire Vancouver-based Miramar Mining Corp. goes through. 
The world's second-largest gold producer has been searching high and low for new gold projects to replace 
dwindling reserves in the midst of a superhot market for bullion. 
Gold is widely expected to hit $800 (U.S.) an ounce by the end of the year and most mining executives say 
$1,000 an ounce is on the horizon. The metal gained another $4.60 yesterday, to close at $737.40. 
But the soaring price comes at a time when significant discoveries are becoming increasingly scarce, forcing the 
big players to either merge or gobble up smaller companies to replace lost production. 
Newmont has been warning investors for months that its older mines were getting more costly to run, with each 
bucket of ore extracted containing lower grades of the precious yellow metal. 
"The Hope Bay resource is five million-plus ounces. That's a level that attracts the majors," said analyst John Ing 
of Maison Placements Canada. 
"The biggest problem for all gold miners right now is replacing reserves and production. This kind of acquisition 
seems to be the antidote," Ing said. 
Hope Bay is Miramar's flagship, 1,000-square-kilometre gold project on the Arctic coast of the territory of Nunavut 
and is one of the largest undeveloped gold properties in the world. 
The problem is that it's expected to take at least three years to build, meaning the earliest production likely won't 
happen until the next decade. 
"It doesn't seem to satisfy their near-term problems," Ing said. 
The two companies announced the friendly cash deal yesterday, saying it has the unanimous support of 
Miramar's board of directors. 
Newmont is offering Miramar shareholders $6.25 cash per common share. 
The offer represents a premium of 29 per cent over Miramar's 20-day average trading price on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange up to last Friday, the firms said. 
Denver-based Newmont already has a 9 per cent stake in the Hope Bay project, which is made up of three 
defined deposits in an area comparable to prolific gold belts in Yellowknife and Kirkland Lake. 
The deal comes about three months after Richard O'Brien took over as chief executive of Newmont and shifted 
the company's focus back to core mining operations. 
"We made an initial investment in Miramar in 2005 because we saw the potential strategic opportunity offered by 
the Hope Bay project as part of our broader exploration and growth portfolio," O'Brien said. 
"We have been impressed with the progress of the project since that time," he said.

The formal offer and takeover bid circular will be mailed to Miramar shareholders by the end of the month. 
Miramar will have to pay a breakup fee of $41.4 million if the acquisition doesn't go through. 
"We believe Newmont's offer takes into account the value of the existing resources at Hope Bay along with the 
significant upside potential. I firmly believe this is a world-class project and that its value will continue to be 
realized under the direction of Newmont," Miramar chief executive Tony Walsh said. 
While Hope Bay isn't located in a politically risky mining area, as is the case with some South American projects, 
the logistics of building and operating a mine in the Arctic Circle will prove challenging, said analyst Barry Allan of 
Research Capital Corp. "The resource is spread over quite a remote area. You're going to have to go big or stay 
home with this one," he said. 
The news sent Miramar shares soaring 21 per cent, or $1.09, to close at $6.28 on the Toronto Stock Exchange 
yesterday.

Newmont joins the gold rush to Nunavut; Friendly bid for Miramar Mining snags Hope Bay project on 
Arctic coast; it's the third major deal for properties in the region this year

Newmont Mining Corp. has delivered a vote of confidence in Nunavut as a potential new gold mining hot spot with 
its bid to buy Miramar Mining Corp. 
Newmont unveiled yesterday a friendly $1.5-billion cash offer for Vancouver-based Miramar, which owns the 
massive Hope Bay project on the mainland coast of the Arctic Ocean. More than nine million ounces of gold have 
been identified at the deposit. 
Denver-based Newmont, the world's second-largest gold producer, already owns about 8.4 per cent of Miramar's 
shares, and holds warrants that could bring its stake up to 15 per cent. It is offering $6.25 for each Miramar 
share, 20 per cent above last Friday's closing price of $5.19. 
Miramar's board has given its approval, and its financial advisers have also signed off on the deal, which is set to 
close at the end of the year. 
Newmont spokesman Omar Jabara said Miramar is an attractive partner because it holds a key property in one 
of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in the world. The buy is a “strategic forward-looking acquisition to 
establish a new core mining district in a triple-A-rated country,” he said. 
Because the Arctic coast in Nunavut is largely unexplored, there is huge potential for further investment and 
mining in the area, he said. 
It's too early to say whether Miramar's plans for development of the Hope Bay site – including construction this 
winter and some mining to begin before the end of 2008 – will be accelerated, Mr. Jabara said. After the takeover 
has closed “we'll look at those plans and see how they fit into our objectives,” he said. 
Over all, Newmont is buying Miramar because it is bullish on gold, Mr. Jabara said. “We believe the price of gold 
is going to continue to rise, and [that will] make the prospects for this area more attractive.” 
About two weeks ago Miramar received approval for the Hope Bay project from the Nunavut Water Board, a key 
hurdle before construction can begin. Still, there are several more approval processes that have to be completed. 
If the plans comes to fruition, the Hope Bay project would eventually include several underground and open-pit 
mines on a site that extends inland from the Arctic Ocean, east of Bathurst Inlet. 
“The true potential of the project can best be realized with the additional expertise and resources of a global gold 
company like Newmont,” Richard O'Brien, president and chief executive officer of Newmont, said in a statement. 
Mark Smith, an analyst who follows Miramar at Dundee Securities, said the price Newmont is offering appears 
fair. While “it's possible there could be another bid, I think it's highly unlikely.” 
Since Newmont already has a stake in Miramar, the target company's board has signed on, he said. Also, 
Newmont has access to data on the Hope Bay site, so it would be difficult for another player to jump into the fray. 
“Newmont's already in the driver's seat.”

Miramar would also have to pay a break fee of about $41.5-million if the deal with Newmont fell through in the 
face of a higher offer. 
The bid for Miramar marks the third significant deal for a Nunavut property in the past year. In February, 
Toronto's Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. bid $710-million for Cumberland Resources Ltd. and its prized asset, the 
Meadowbank gold project. Less than a week later, Australian zinc producer Zinifex Ltd. made a $360-million play 
for Canada's Wolfden Resources Inc. in a deal to secure Wolfden's High Lake and Izok projects. 
Newmont's bid comes less than two weeks after the company shocked delegates at the Denver Gold Forum 
when it warned that its costs would likely be higher than expected and it may not be able to replace the reserves it 
will deplete through mining this year. 
Shortly after taking over the top job at Newmont in July, Mr. O'Brien indicated that the firm would begin 
considering smaller acquisitions.

Release date - 09102007 
DENVER, Colorado and Vancouver, British Columbia-- Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) and Miramar 
Mining Corporation (TSX: MAE, AMEX: MNG) announced today that they have entered into a definitive support 
agreement that provides for the acquisition by Newmont, with the unanimous support of the Miramar board of 
directors, of all the outstanding common shares of Miramar for C$6.25 cash per common share. 
The acquisition will be effected through a take-over bid, the full details of which will be contained in Newmont's 
take-over bid circular that is expected to be mailed to Miramar shareholders by the end of October. The 
transaction values Miramar at approximately C$1.5 billion on a fully-diluted basis. The offer represents a 
premium of approximately 29% over Miramar's 20-day volume weighted average trading price on the TSX 
through October 5, 2007. 
The board of directors of Miramar has unanimously determined that the offer to be made by Newmont is fair and 
that it will recommend that shareholders tender to the offer. Miramar has received opinions from BMO Capital 
Markets and Paradigm Capital Inc. that, subject to the limitations and qualifications stated in such opinions, the 
consideration to be received under the offer is fair, from a financial point of view, to Miramar shareholders. All of 
the directors and senior officers of Miramar have entered into written agreements to accept Newmont's offer and 
to tender their shares to the take-over bid. 
Richard O'Brien, Chief Executive Officer and President of Newmont, said, 'We made an initial investment in 
Miramar in 2005 because we saw the potential strategic opportunity offered by the Hope Bay Project as part of 
our broader exploration and growth portfolio. We have been impressed with the progress of the Project since that 
time, and believe that, as a result of its scale, the true potential of the Project can best be realized with the 
additional expertise and resources of a global gold company like Newmont. Consistent with our strategic focus on 
exploration and project development, this transaction represents the next logical step for this world class 
resource. This transaction further emphasizes our focus on our core gold business while providing opportunities 
for sustainable, lower cost production and future reserve replacement.' 
The strategic benefits offered by this transaction include: 
-the opportunity for Newmont to establish a new, core mining district in the Nunavut Territory of Canada; -the 
opportunity for Newmont's exploration and project development teams to focus on a long-term deposit with 
competitive operating costs that is one of the top known, undeveloped gold deposits globally; -the opportunity to 
reduce the technical risk associated with the Project using Newmont's historic investment in and understanding of 
the Hope Bay Project, and; -the opportunity for Newmont to control and explore a roughly 80 by 20 kilometer 
greenstone belt with substantial exploration potential located in a AAA-rated country. 
Tony Walsh, President and Chief Executive Officer of Miramar said, 'We believe Newmont's offer takes into 
account the value of the existing resources at Hope Bay along with the significant upside potential. I firmly believe 
this is a world class project and that its value will continue to be realized under the direction of Newmont, a world 
class gold mining company.' 
Full details of the offer will be included in the formal offer and take-over bid circular that is expected to be mailed 
to Miramar shareholders by the end of October. Newmont's take-over bid circular will be accompanied by 
Miramar's directors' circular, which will provide shareholders of Miramar with, among other things, the rationale 
for the unanimous recommendation of the Miramar board that shareholders accept Newmont's offer. Newmont's 
obligation to acquire shares pursuant to the offer will be subject to certain customary conditions, including there 
having been validly deposited at the expiry of the offer a number of common shares of Miramar that, together 
with the common shares held by Newmont and its affiliates, constitutes at least 66 2/3% of the common shares of 
Miramar then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (disregarding shares that may be acquired by Newmont

Page 40 of 77 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
pursuant to warrants that it owns). Newmont currently holds an approximately 8.4% basic and 15.0% fully-diluted 
common share interest in Miramar. 
Newmont also announced that it has enhanced its existing financing capacity with a US$1.3 billion underwritten 
financing commitment from JPMorgan and Citi that is in addition to approximately US$1.5 billion in available 
capacity under its current revolving credit facility. 
Newmont has engaged Genuity Capital Markets as its financial advisor and Citi and JPMorgan as co-advisors, 
and engaged Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Goodmans LLP as its legal advisors in connection with the 
transaction. Miramar has engaged BMO Capital Markets as its sole financial advisor, and Gowling Lafleur 
Henderson LLP and Dorsey & Whitney LLP as its legal advisors in connection with the transaction.

Corporate News: Newmont buys Miramar to replenish gold stocks

Newmont Mining Corp., seeking to replenish its thinning gold stockpiles, agreed to buy Canadian gold explorer 
Miramar Mining Corp. in a transaction that values Miramar at C$1.5 billion (US$1.52 billion). 
The proposed C$6.25-a-share acquisition would bring Denver-based Newmont a source of future gold production 
and extend its mining assets in a politically stable country. Miramar is based in North Vancouver, British 
Columbia. The per-share price represents a 20% premium to Miramar's closing stock price of C$5.19 on Friday. 
Canadian markets were closed Monday for a holiday. 
Global depletion of reserves has led producers to stake claims in countries where political risk, from mine 
seizures to war, is elevated. Newmont took an initial stake in Miramar two years ago. 
Miramar's main asset is its Hope Bay Project in the Nunavut Territory of Canada. The project, which extends over 
1,000 square kilometers, is one of the top known, undeveloped gold deposits globally, according to Newmont. 
"This transaction further emphasizes our focus on our core gold business while providing opportunities for 
sustainable, lower-cost production and future reserve replacement," said Richard O'Brien, Newmont's chief 
executive. 
Replacing its reserves or finding enough future gold sources to keep pace with current production has been 
paramount for Newmont. Last month, Newmont warned of higher costs and dwindling reserves from its older, 
more tapped-out mines and said it isn't finding new lodes fast enough to keep up with its production rates, 
thinning its reserves. 
Newmont has been warning investors for months that its older mines were getting more costly to run, as each 
bucket of ore contained lower grades of the precious metal. The Miramar acquisition could offer a way out of that 
cycle. 
The acquisition agreement is the latest deal in the mining industry, where the segment's biggest players have 
been on the prowl for assets. Last month, Yamana Gold Inc. succeeded in reaching a pact with Meridian Gold 
Inc., with both sides agreeing to a US$3.6 billion acquisition of Meridian by Yamana. Concurrent with that 
purchase will be Yamana's $1 billion acquisition of Northern Orion Resources Inc.

Newmont strikes $1.5-billion deal for Miramar

Newmont Mining Corp.struck a friendly deal to buy Miramar Mining Corp. , marking a new acquisition strategy 
from Newmont's rookie CEO and confirming the Nunavut Territory in Canada's far north as a potential major new 
mining district. 
Denver-based Newmont is offering $6.25 for each Miramar share, valuing the Vancouver junior miner at 
approximately $1.5-billion. 
Newmont, which already owns 8.4 per cent of Miramar's shares as well warrants that bring its stake to 15 per 
cent, will gain control of the Hope Bay Project in Nunavut, a massive deposit where at least 9 million ounces of 
gold have been identified. 
The world's second largest gold producer first invested in Miramar in 2005, one of several investments Newmont 
has made in junior resource plays. “The true potential of the project can best be realized with the additional 
expertise and resources of a global gold company like Newmont,” president and chief executive officer Richard 
O'Brien said in a statement. 
“Consistent with our strategic focus on exploration and project development, this transaction represents the next 
logical step for this world class resource. This transaction further emphasizes our focus on our core gold business 
while providing opportunities for sustainable, lower cost production and future reserve replacement,” he said. 
The friendly bid, which Miramar's board is recommending, comes less than two weeks after Newmont shocked 
delegates at the Denver Gold Forum, warning that costs would likely be higher than expected and that the 
company may not be able to replace the reserves it depletes mining this year. 
Shortly after taking over the top job in July, Mr. O'Brien indicated that Newmont would begin considering smaller 
acquisitions, due in part to the lack of major gold discoveries during the past decade. 
The bid for Miramar marks the third significant deal for a Nunavut property in the past year. In February, 
Toronto's Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd.bid $710-million for Cumberland Resources Ltd. and its prized asset the 
Meadowbank gold project in Nunavut. Less than a week later, Australian zinc producer Zinifex Ltd. made a 
$360-million play for Canada's Wolfden Resources Inc. in a deal to secure Wolfden's High Lake and Izok projects 
in Nunavut. 
Canada's Far North is not without its mining challenges however. Currently, there are no operating mines in the 
region. Major infrastructure developments, including roads to the various projects in the region, will have to be 
completed. 
With the bid for Miramar, Newmont aims to use its size and scale to speed development in Nunavut and reduce 
the technical risks inherent in trying to mine in such a remote and geographically challenging location. 
Newmont's bid for Miramar represents a 29 premium to the stock's average price for the past twenty days. 
“We believe Newmont's offer takes into account the value of the existing resources at Hope Bay along with the 
significant upside potential, Tony Walsh, Miramar's president and CEO said in a statement. 
Tuesday's bid is the second major deal in recent months in the gold sector which has been buoyed by soaring 
bullion prices. The price of gold has climbed to 28-year highs in recent weeks, trading above $740 (U.S.) an 
ounce.

The board of directors of Miramar has unanimously determined that the offer to be made by Newmont is fair and 
that it will recommend that shareholders tender to the offer. Miramar has received opinions from BMO Capital 
Markets and Paradigm Capital Inc. that, subject to the limitations and qualifications stated in such opinions, the 
consideration to be received under the offer is fair, from a financial point of view, to Miramar shareholders. All of 
the directors and senior officers of Miramar have entered into written agreements to accept Newmont's offer and 
to tender their shares to the take- over bid. 
Richard O'Brien, Chief Executive Officer and President of Newmont, said, "We made an initial investment in 
Miramar in 2005 because we saw the potential strategic opportunity offered by the Hope Bay Project as part of 
our broader exploration and growth portfolio. We have been impressed with the progress of the Project since that 
time, and believe that, as a result of its scale, the true potential of the Project can best be realized with the 
additional expertise and resources of a global gold company like Newmont. Consistent with our strategic focus on 
exploration and project development, this transaction represents the next logical step for this world class 
resource. This transaction further emphasizes our focus on our core gold business while providing opportunities 
for sustainable, lower cost production and future reserve replacement." 
The strategic benefits offered by this transaction include: 
-- the opportunity for Newmont to establish a new, core mining district in 
the Nunavut Territory of Canada; 
-- the opportunity for Newmont's exploration and project development teams 
to focus on a long-term deposit with competitive operating costs that 
is one of the top known, undeveloped gold deposits globally; 
-- the opportunity to reduce the technical risk associated with the 
Project using Newmont's historic investment in and understanding of the 
Hope Bay Project, and; 
-- the opportunity for Newmont to control and explore a roughly 80 by 20 
kilometer greenstone belt with substantial exploration potential 
located in a AAA-rated country. 
Tony Walsh, President and Chief Executive Officer of Miramar said, "We believe Newmont's offer takes into 
account the value of the existing resources at Hope Bay along with the significant upside potential. I firmly believe 
this is a world class project and that its value will continue to be realized under the direction of Newmont, a world 
class gold mining company." 
Full details of the offer will be included in the formal offer and take- over bid circular that is expected to be mailed 
to Miramar shareholders by the end of October. Newmont's take-over bid circular will be accompanied by 
Miramar's directors' circular, which will provide shareholders of Miramar with, among other things, the rationale

for the unanimous recommendation of the Miramar board that shareholders accept Newmont's offer. Newmont's 
obligation to acquire shares pursuant to the offer will be subject to certain customary conditions, including there 
having been validly deposited at the expiry of the offer a number of common shares of Miramar that, together 
with the common shares held by Newmont and its affiliates, constitutes at least 66 2/3% of the common shares of 
Miramar then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (disregarding shares that may be acquired by Newmont 
pursuant to warrants that it owns). Newmont currently holds an approximately 8.4% basic and 15.0% fully- diluted 
common share interest in Miramar. 
Newmont also announced that it has enhanced its existing financing capacity with a US$1.3 billion underwritten 
financing commitment from JPMorgan and Citi that is in addition to approximately US$1.5 billion in available 
capacity under its current revolving credit facility. 
Newmont has engaged Genuity Capital Markets as its financial advisor and Citi and JPMorgan as co-advisors, 
and engaged Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Goodmans LLP as its legal advisors in connection with the 
transaction. Miramar has engaged BMO Capital Markets as its sole financial advisor, and Gowling Lafleur 
Henderson LLP and Dorsey & Whitney LLP as its legal advisors in connection with the transaction.

UPDATE 3-Newmont to buy Miramar Mining for C$1.5 billion 
UPDATE 3-Newmont to buy Miramar Mining for C$1.5 billion

(c) 2007 Reuters Limited 
(Adds details) 
NEW YORK/TORONTO, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Newmont Mining Corp , eager to replenish tight gold reserves, said on 
Tuesday it would buy Canadian explorer Miramar Mining Corp for C$1.5 billion (US$1.52 billion). 
The all-cash deal, which won unanimous approval from Miramar's board of directors, will give world No. 2 gold 
producer Newmont control of the undeveloped Hope Bay project in the far north Canadian territory of Nunavut. 
The project has indicated and inferred resources of 10.7 million ounces, according to Miramar's Web site. 
"In terms of Newmont, this was a strategic acquisition that they've been looking at for a long time," said Mark 
Smith, an analyst at Dundee Securities, who said the C$6.25 a share purchase price was just below his own price 
target for Miramar. 
The offer is a 20 percent premium to Miramar's closing price on Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
Canadian markets were closed on Monday for Thanksgiving. 
In midday trading, the company's shares were up C$1.09 at C$6.28, while Newmont was up 79 cents at $45.62. 
"This transaction further emphasizes our focus on our core gold business while providing opportunities for 
sustainable, lower cost production and future reserve replacement," Newmont Chief Executive Richard O'Brien 
said in a statement. 
The deal comes as large gold players have struggled to find reserves to ensure steady future production. 
Just last month, Denver-based Newmont warned that the large-scale mature and low grade nature of current gold 
deposits could limit its ability to replace reserves this year. 
While gold prices have jumped to 28-year highs recently, the rise has been matched by soaring costs for labor, 
energy, and industrial commodities, which have pressured company margins. 
REMOTE RESOURCE 
"You have to understand what they're going after here is not any near-term source of production, and indeed 
there's not a reserve that you can talk (about) in any near term on the horizon. What they're buying is a big 
resource," said Barry Allan of Research Capital, who follows both Newmont and Miramar. 
"It is a pretty remote location. It's about as far north as you can go in Canada and not be wet." 
Newmont spokesman Omar Jabara said it was too early to predict when the company would be able to establish 
reserves or target production at the project. 
"We need to get past this first hurdle and make sure the deal is completed, and then what we hope to do is go in 
and do some initial analysis and develop a plan," he said. 
"It's one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in the world and much of it remains largely unexplored." 
Newmont said it received a $1.3 billion financing commitment from JPMorgan and Citigroup and has $1.5 billion 
in available capacity under its current revolving credit facility.

Newmont Mining Corp. announced plans today to buy the Canadian gold company Miramar Mining Corp. for 
C$6.25 cash per common share. 
Denver-based Newmont (NYSE: NEM) said the deal values Vancouver, B.C.-based Miramar (TSX: MAE) at 
about C$1.5 billion (US$1.52 billion). The offer represents a premium of about 29 percent over Miramar's 20-day 
volume weighted average trading price on the Toronto Stock Exchange through Oct. 5. 
JP Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. have committed to underwrite a $1.3 billion loan for the deal. 
The acquisition, which will be executed through a takeover bid later this month, has the unanimous support of 
Miramar's board of directors, the companies said in a join statement. Newmont already owns an 8.4 percent 
interest in Miramar, whose core gold-mining operation is centered around Hope Bay in the Canadian Arctic. 
"This transaction further emphasizes our focus on our core gold business while providing opportunities for 
sustainable, lower-cost production and future reserve replacement," said Newmont CEO Richard O'Brien in a 
statement. 
In late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Newmont was up 80 cents a share, or 1.78 percent, 
from the previous close of $44.83. On the Toronto exchange, Miramar was up $1.01 a share, or 19.46 percent, 
from the previous close of $5.19.

Release date - 09102007 
DENVER, Colorado and Vancouver, British Columbia - Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) and Miramar 
Mining Corporation (TSX: MAE, AMEX: MNG) announced today that they have entered into a definitive support 
agreement that provides for the acquisition by Newmont, with the unanimous support of the Miramar board of 
directors, of all the outstanding common shares of Miramar for C$6.25 cash per common share. 
The acquisition will be effected through a take-over bid, the full details of which will be contained in Newmont's 
take-over bid circular that is expected to be mailed to Miramar shareholders by the end of October. The 
transaction values Miramar at approximately C$1.5 billion on a fully-diluted basis. 
The offer represents a premium of approximately 29% over Miramar's 20-day volume weighted average trading 
price on the TSX through October 5, 2007. 
The board of directors of Miramar has unanimously determined that the offer to be made by Newmont is fair and 
that it will recommend that shareholders tender to the offer. Miramar has received opinions from BMO Capital 
Markets and Paradigm Capital Inc. that, subject to the limitations and qualifications stated in such opinions, the 
consideration to be received under the offer is fair, from a financial point of view, to Miramar shareholders. All of 
the directors and senior officers of Miramar have entered into written agreements to accept Newmont's offer and 
to tender their shares to the take-over bid. 
Richard O'Brien, Chief Executive Officer and President of Newmont, said, 'We made an initial investment in 
Miramar in 2005 because we saw the potential strategic opportunity offered by the Hope Bay Project as part of 
our broader exploration and growth portfolio. We have been impressed with the progress of the Project since that 
time, and believe that, as a result of its scale, the true potential of the Project can best be realized with the 
additional expertise and resources of a global gold company like Newmont. Consistent with our strategic focus on 
exploration and project development, this transaction represents the next logical step for this world class 
resource. This transaction further emphasizes our focus on our core gold business while providing opportunities 
for sustainable, lower cost production and future reserve replacement.' 
The strategic benefits offered by this transaction include: 
-the opportunity for Newmont to establish a new, core mining district in the Nunavut Territory of Canada; -the 
opportunity for Newmont's exploration and project development teams to focus on a long-term deposit with 
competitive operating costs that is one of the top known, undeveloped gold deposits globally; -the opportunity to 
reduce the technical risk associated with the Project using Newmont's historic investment in and understanding of 
the Hope Bay Project, and; -the opportunity for Newmont to control and explore a roughly 80 by 20 kilometer 
greenstone belt with substantial exploration potential located in a AAA-rated country. Tony Walsh, President and 
Chief Executive Officer of Miramar said, 'We believe Newmont's offer takes into account the value of the existing 
resources at Hope Bay along with the significant upside potential. I firmly believe this is a world class project and 
that its value will continue to be realized under the direction of Newmont, a world class gold mining company.' Full 
details of the offer will be included in the formal offer and take-over bid circular that is expected to be mailed to 
Miramar shareholders by the end of October. Newmont's take-over bid circular will be accompanied by 
Miramar's directors' circular, which will provide shareholders of Miramar with, among other things, the rationale 
for the unanimous recommendation of the Miramar board that shareholders accept Newmont's offer. Newmont's 
obligation to acquire shares pursuant to the offer will be subject to certain customary conditions, including there 
having been validly deposited at the expiry of the offer a number of common shares of Miramar that, together 
with the common shares held by Newmont and its affiliates, constitutes at least 66 2/3% of the common shares of 
Miramar then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (disregarding shares that may be acquired by Newmont 
pursuant to warrants that it owns). Newmont currently holds an approximately 8.4% basic and 15.0% fully-diluted 
common share interest in Miramar. Newmont also announced that it has enhanced its existing financing capacity

with a US$1.3 billion underwritten financing commitment from JPMorgan and Citi that is in addition to

Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Goodmans LLP as its legal advisors in connection with the transaction. Miramar has 
engaged BMO Capital Markets as its sole financial advisor, and Gowling Lafleur Henderson LLP and Dorsey &

UPDATE: Newmont Mining To Buy Canada's Miramar For $1.5 Billion 
UPDATE: Newmont Mining To Buy Canada's Miramar For $1.5 Billion

By Laura Mandaro 
SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones) -- Newmont Mining Corp., seeking to replenish its thinning gold stockpiles, said 
Tuesday it reached a friendly deal to buy Canadian gold explorer Miramar Mining Corp. for $1.5 billion. 
Denver-based Newmont (NEM) said it has offered to pay C$6.25 ($6.36) in cash for all oustanding Miramar 
Mining (MNG) shares. The price represents a 29% premium to Miramar's 20-day volume-weighted average 
trading price on the Toronto Stock Exchange through Friday. 
The board of directors of Miramar, based in North Vancouver, B.C., has unanimously backed the offer and will 
recommend it to shareholders. 
Miramar's U.S.-listed shares jumped 21% to $6.24 in morning action. Shares of Newmont, which took an initial 
stake in Miramar two years ago, rose 1.1%. 
The acquisition brings Newmont -- one of the few precious-metals companies included in the S&P 500 index 
(SPX) -- a source of future gold production. It also extends Newmont's mining assets in a politically stable 
country. 
That's considered a premium in the mining business: Global depletion in reserves has led producers to stake 
claims in countries where political risk, from mine seizures to war, runs higher. 
Miramar's main asset is its Hope Bay Project in the Nunavut Territory of Canada. The project, which extends over 
1,000 square kilometers, is one of the top known, undeveloped gold deposits globally, according to Newmont. 
"This transaction further emphasizes our focus on our core gold business while providing opportunities for 
sustainable, lower cost production and future reserve replacement," said Richard O'Brien, Newmont's chief 
executive, in a statement. 
Replacing its reserves or finding enough future gold sources to keep pace with current production has been 
paramount for Newmont. In late September, Newmont warned it might not be able to replace its proven and 
probable reserves this year because some of its larger mines are getting older and producing lower-grade ores. [

Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) agreed to buy Miramar Mining Corp. (MNG) for C$1.5 billion (US$1.52 billion), as 
Newmont moves to improve its fading reserves. 
The Denver mining company will pay C$6.25 a share, a 20% premium to Miramar's closing price of C$5.19 on 
Friday. Monday was Thanksgiving in Canada. 
Last month, Newmont warned of higher costs and dwindling reserves from its older, more tapped-out mines and 
said it is not finding new lodes fast enough to keep up with its production rates, thinning its reserves. Newmont 
has been warning investors for months that its older mines were getting more costly to run, as each bucket of ore 
brought out of the mine contained lower grades of the precious metal. This deal may offer a way out of that cycle. 
Miramar, a Canadian gold company, controls the Hope Bay Project in Canada's Nunavut Territory, one of the 
largest undeveloped gold projects in North America. The Hope Bay Project extends over 1,000 square kilometers 
and encompasses one of the most prospective undeveloped greenstone belts in North America. 
The two companies have had a relationship for some time. 
"We made an initial investment in Miramar in 2005 because we saw the potential strategic opportunity offered by 
the Hope Bay Project as part of our broader exploration and growth portfolio," said Newmont Chief Executive 
Richard O'Brien. "We have been impressed with the progress of the Project since that time, and believe that, as 
a result of its scale, the true potential of the Project can best be realized with the additional expertise and 
resources of a global gold company like Newmont." 
The deal is the latest merger in the mining industry, where the segment's biggest players have been on the prowl 
for more assets.Last month, Yamana Gold Inc. (AUY) succeeded in its effort to acquire Meridian Gold Inc. (MDG), 
with both sides agreeing to a US$3.6 billion cash-and-stock transaction. Concurrent with that purchase will be 
Yamana's $1 billion acquisition of Northern Orion Resources Inc. (NTO). 
Newmont said it added a $1.3 billion financing commitment from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. 
(C), in addition to its current $1.5 billion credit facility to help finance the deal. 
Newmont shares rose slightly in premarket trading to $44.99.

VANCOUVER _ Newmont Mining Corp. (NYSE:NEM) is looking to bulk up its resources with a $1.5-billion deal to 
acquire Miramar Mining Corp. of Vancouver (TSX:MAE), owner of the Hope Bay project in Nunavut, one of the 
largest undeveloped gold sites in North America. 
The acquisition would give Denver-headquartered Newmont, the world's second-largest gold company after 
Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp. (TSX:ABX), a new foothold in Nunavut's core mining district and boost 
Newmont's global reserves, and is part of an industry -wide trend toward consolidation. 
It comes about three months after Richard O'Brien took over as chief executive and shifted Newmont's focus 
back to core mining operations. 
The deal, ``is attractive for a number of reasons including the size and quality of the deposit, it appears to have 
fairly high grades, it's also in a triple-A rated country, and the development of the resource appears to have the 
support of the Canadian government and the government of Nunavut,'' Newmont spokesman Omar Jabara said 
Tuesday. 
``This is a strategic, forward-looking acquisition that we believe and hope will establish a new core mining 
district.'' 
The company had said last month that costs this year might exceed its previous estimate of $375 to $400 per 
ounce, and warned it might not be able to replace its proven and probable reserves, since its mines are aging. 
The Hope Bay gold belt is believed to hold at least nine million ounces of gold. 
Miramar reported better than expected results from a 20-hole drilling program in June, saying resource estimates 
would be expanded significantly. 
``We made an initial investment in Miramar in 2005 because we saw the potential strategic opportunity offered by 
the Hope Bay project as part of our broader exploration and growth portfolio,'' stated Newmont CEO Richard 
O'Brien, who was in England and not available for further comment. 
``We have been impressed with the progress of the project since that time, and believe that, as a result of its 
scale, the true potential of the project can best be realized with the additional expertise and resources of a global 
gold company like Newmont.'' 
Miramar president and CEO Tony Walsh said the offer is fair, and ``takes into account the value of the existing 
resources at Hope Bay along with the significant upside potential.'' 
The companies said Tuesday that Miramar's board of directors unanimously supports the offer of $6.25 per share 
in cash. 
That's a premium of 20.4 per cent over Miramar's closing price of $5.19 Friday on the TSX, but the stock traded 
Tuesday afternoon at $6.29, indicating some hopes for a higher offer although Newmont already owns 15 per 
cent of Miramar's stock. 
Patrick Chidley, an analyst with Barnard Jacobs Mellet, said the deal was good for Miramar. 
``It seems to be a reasonably high for where undeveloped resources are trading, particularly as there are no 
reserves as yet here to speak of, or very little anyway,'' he said.

Page 65 of 77 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
``While it's a large resource they're buying they're paying quite a lot for it, so I think they're going to be expecting 
to find quite a bit more with further drilling and also in terms of the drill results that we're seeing this year.'' 
Chidley said he expected Newmont would be able to grow the resource and turn some of it into reserves over the 
next year to year and a half. 
However Joe Foster, who owns shares in both companies as portfolio manager of the Van Eck International 
Investors Gold Fund, said he believes the offer is on the low end given that Miramar has said it has inferred 
resources of at least nine million gold ounces in the Hope Bay project, with the potential for more. 
``I think Newmont would be getting a great deal if shareholders tendered into this bid,'' Foster said. ``There aren't 
that many (deposits) left in the world that a large company like Newmont could acquire and develop. It really is a 
unique asset.'' 
Jabara said Newmont believed the area had significant potential in addition to what's already been identified, but 
has not yet determined a timeline for the project. 
``Right now we're focused on closing the deal,'' he said. 
``Once that's done, we're going to do some additional comprehensive studies and then develop a plan that will 
responsibly maximize Hope Bay's full potential.'' 
The takeover follows deals between Toronto's Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (TSX:AEM) and Cumberland Resources 
Ltd. as well as Zinifex Ltd. and Wolfden Resources Inc._ all in Nunavut. 
To pay for the transaction, Newmont said it has secured a US$1.3-billion financing from JPMorgan and Citi on top 
of about US$1.5 billion under a current revolving credit facility. 
Shares in Newmont, which has major operations in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia and Ghana, 
closed up $1.19 or 2.7 per cent at US$46.02 on the NYSE. Miramar closed at $6.28, up $1.09 or 21 per cent, 
with 113.1 million shares traded.

through a takeover bid, the full details of which will be contained in Newmont's takeover bid circular that is 
expected to be mailed to Miramar shareholders by the end of October. The transaction values Miramar at 
approximately $1.5-billion on a fully diluted basis. The offer represents a premium of approximately 29 per cent 
over Miramar's 20-day volume weighted average trading price on the Toronto Stock Exchange through Oct. 5, 
2007. 
The board of directors of Miramar has unanimously determined that the offer to be made by Newmont is fair and 
that it will recommend that shareholders tender to the offer. Miramar has received opinions from BMO Capital 
Markets and Paradigm Capital Inc. that, subject to the limitations and qualifications stated in such opinions, the 
consideration to be received under the offer is fair, from a financial point of view, to Miramar shareholders. All of 
the directors and senior officers of Miramar have entered into written agreements to accept Newmont's offer and 
to tender their shares to the takeover bid. 
Richard O'Brien, chief executive officer and president of Newmont, said: "We made an initial investment in 
Miramar in 2005 because we saw the potential strategic opportunity offered by the Hope Bay project as part of 
our broader exploration and growth portfolio. We have been impressed with the progress of the project since that 
time, and believe that, as a result of its scale, the true potential of the project can best be realized with the 
additional expertise and resources of a global gold company like Newmont. Consistent with our strategic focus on 
exploration and project development, this transaction represents the next logical step for this world-class 
resource. This transaction further emphasizes our focus on our core gold business while providing opportunities 
for sustainable, lower-cost production and future reserve replacement." 
The strategic benefits offered by this transaction include: 
- The opportunity for Newmont to establish a new, core mining district in the Nunavut Territory of Canada; 
- The opportunity for Newmont's exploration and project development teams to focus on a long-term deposit with 
competitive operating costs that is one of the top known, undeveloped gold deposits globally; 
- The opportunity to reduce the technical risk associated with the project using Newmont's historic investment in 
and understanding of the Hope Bay project; 
- The opportunity for Newmont to control and explore a roughly 80-by-20-kilometre greenstone belt with 
substantial exploration potential located in a AAA-rated country.

Tony Walsh, president and chief executive officer of Miramar, said: "We believe Newmont's offer takes into 
account the value of the existing resources at Hope Bay along with the significant upside potential. I firmly believe 
this is a world-class project and that its value will continue to be realized under the direction of Newmont, a 
world-class gold mining company." 
Full details of the offer will be included in the formal offer and takeover bid circular that is expected to be mailed to 
Miramar shareholders by the end of October. Newmont's takeover bid circular will be accompanied by Miramar's 
directors' circular, which will provide shareholders of Miramar with, among other things, the rationale for the 
unanimous recommendation of the Miramar board that shareholders accept Newmont's offer. Newmont's 
obligation to acquire shares pursuant to the offer will be subject to certain customary conditions, including there 
having been validly deposited at the expiry of the offer a number of common shares of Miramar that, together 
with the common shares held by Newmont and its affiliates, constitute at least two-thirds of the common shares of 
Miramar then outstanding on a fully diluted basis (disregarding shares that may be acquired by Newmont 
pursuant to warrants that it owns). Newmont currently holds an approximately 8.4-per-cent basic and 
15.0-per-cent fully diluted common share interest in Miramar. 
Newmont also has enhanced its existing financing capacity with a $1.3-billion (U.S.) underwritten financing 
commitment from JPMorgan and Citi that is in addition to approximately $1.5-billion (U.S.) in available capacity 
under its current revolving credit facility. 
Newmont has engaged Genuity Capital Markets as its financial adviser and Citi and JPMorgan as co-advisers, 
and has engaged Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Goodmans LLP as its legal advisers in connection with the 
transaction. Miramar has engaged BMO Capital Markets as its sole financial adviser, and Gowling Lafleur 
Henderson LLP and Dorsey & Whitney LLP as its legal advisers in connection with the transaction.

Newmont Mining to acquire Canadian gold miner Miramar for $1.53B

TORONTO (AP) - Newmont Mining Corp., the world's second-largest gold producer, on Tuesday said it has 
agreed to buy Canadian rival Miramar Mining Corp. for about US$1.53 billion. 
The offer of 6.25 Canadian dollars ($US6.36) per share represents a 24 percent premium over Miramar's closing 
stock price of $5.15 on Monday in New York. 
In a joint statement, the companies said the acquisition will be in the form of a takeover bid, with full details being 
disclosed to shareholders by the end of October. 
Miramar's board has unanimously agreed to the bid, and is expected to recommend the deal to shareholders, the 
companies said. 
In 2005, Denver-based Newmont acquired a 9.9 percent stake in Miramar by investing US$36.4 million in a 
then-undeveloped Canadian gold field known as the Hope Bay gold belt -- which is believed to have at least nine 
million ounces of gold. 
"We made an initial investment in Miramar in 2005 because we saw the potential strategic opportunity offered by 
the Hope Bay project as part of our broader exploration and growth portfolio," Newmont CEO Richard O'Brien 
said in a release. 
"We have been impressed with the progress of the project since that time, and believe that, as a result of its 
scale, the true potential of the project can best be realized with the additional expertise and resources of a global 
gold company like Newmont." 
Newmont said the acquisition will allow for construction of a new mining district in Canada's Nunavut territory, and 
give it more opportunities to expand existing projects in Canada's far north. 
Miramar President and CEO Tony Walsh called it a fair offer -- a 29 percent premium over Miramar's 20-day 
average trading price on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
"We think Hope Bay's a world class asset, and we think this is a good fair price for the shareholders," Walsh said 
in an interview. 
Last Month, Newmont said costs in 2007 might exceed its previous estimate of $375 per ounce to $400 per 
ounce, and warned it might not be able to replace its proven and probable reserves, since its mines are aging. 
Goldman Sachs analyst Oscar Cabrera, in a client note, warned last month that Newmont's inability to replace 
reserves would limit the company's organic growth prospects 
In premarket trading, shares of Miramar surged 88 cents, or 17.1 percent, to $6.03, while Newmont added 16 
cents to $44.99.

DENVER (AP) - Newmont Mining Corp. is reaching into the Artic Circle for its next project, agreeing Tuesday to 
pay $1.53 billion for Miramar Mining Corp., which controls one of the largest undeveloped gold properties in 
North America. 
One of the world's largest gold producers, Newmont said the acquisition would pave the way for creation of a 
mining district in the remote region of Canada's Nunavut Territory. 
Newmont, which already owns a 9.9 percent stake in Vancouver-based Miramar, offered 6.25 Canadian dollars 
($6.36) per share for the remaining shares, representing a 24 percent premium over Miramar's Monday closing 
stock price of $5.15 a share. 
Miramar's board unanimously agreed to the takeover bid and is expected to recommend the deal to 
shareholders, the companies said. Full details will be disclosed to shareholders by the end of October. 
The acquisition would boost Newmont's global reserves, and is part of an industry-wide trend toward 
consolidation as it becomes more difficult to find gold reserves. It comes about three months after Richard 
O'Brien took over as chief executive and shifted Newmont's focus back to core mining operations. 
"I think they are paying quite a lot for this and hopefuly know basically what they're doing here," Barnard Jacobs 
Mellet analyst Patrick Chidley said. "I think it's something where there has got to be growth." 
Joe Foster, who owns shares in both companies as portfolio manager of the Van Eck International Investors Gold 
Fund, said he believes the offer is on the low end given that Miramar has said it has inferred resources of at least 
9 million gold ounces in the Hope Bay project, with the potential for more. 
"I think Newmont would be getting a great deal if shareholders tendered into this bid," Foster said. "There aren't 
that many (deposits) left in the world that a large company like Newmont could acquire and develop. It really is a 
unique asset." 
In 2005, Newmont purchased the 9.9 percent stake in Miramar by investing $36.4 million in the Hope Bay gold 
belt. 
"We have been impressed with the progress of the project since that time, and believe that, as a result of its 
scale, the true potential of the project can best be realized with the additional expertise and resources of a global 
gold company like Newmont," O'Brien said in a news release. 
Miramar President and CEO Tony Walsh called it a fair offer -- a 29 percent premium over Miramar's 20-day 
average trading price on the Toronto Stock Exchange. "We think Hope Bay's a world class asset, and we think 
this is a good fair price for the shareholders," Walsh said. 
Last month, Newmont said costs in 2007 might exceed its previous estimate of $375 per ounce to $400 per 
ounce, and warned it might not be able to replace its proven and probable reserves, since its mines are aging. 
Shares of Miramar increased $1.23 to $6.38 a share and Newmont's stock rose $1.19 to $46.02 a share on 
Tuesday.

NEW YORK, Oct 9, 2007 (AFP) - 
Newmont Mining announced plans Tuesday to buy Canadian rival Miramar Mining Corp. for some 1.5 billion 
dollars in a deal giving the US firm the massive Hope Bay gold fields on Canada's Arctic coast. 
The deal gives Miramar owners 6.25 Canadian dollars (6.32 US dollars) per share or about 1.52 billion US 
dollars, amounting to a premium of some 29 percent over Miramar's 20-day average trading price through the 
end of last week. 
Miramar's board has approved the deal and recommended it to shareholders, according to a joint statement. 
Denver, Colorado-based Newmont, which already has an 8.4 percent stake in Miramar, said a merger would help 
lower operating costs and establish a "core mining district" in Canada's Nunavut Territory seen as one of the most 
promising gold fields in North America. 
"We made an initial investment in Miramar in 2005 because we saw the potential strategic opportunity offered by 
the Hope Bay Project as part of our broader exploration and growth portfolio," said Newmont chief executive and 
president Richard O'Brien. 
"We have been impressed with the progress of the project since that time, and believe that, as a result of its 
scale, the true potential of the project can best be realized with the additional expertise and resources of a global 
gold company like Newmont. 
"Consistent with our strategic focus on exploration and project development, this transaction represents the next 
logical step for this world class resource," O'Brien said. 
Newmont, which has operations in Australia, Ghana, Indonesia and Peru, said it had obtained 1.3 billion dollars in 
financing from JP Morgan and Citigroup on top of an existing line of credit of 1.5 billion dollars. 
Miramar, based in Vancouver, is best known for the Hope Bay Project, which includes about 1,000 square 
kilometers (400 square miles) in the Nunavut Territory.
