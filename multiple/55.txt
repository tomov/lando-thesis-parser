BANKING Citigroup offer shows it still has yen for Japan

CITIGROUP is planning a return to the scene of some of its most serious regulatory blunders with an audacious 
$11bn ( pounds 6bn) plan to take control of the third largest brokerage in Japan. 
Citigroup said it was offering ¥1,350 for each share of Nikko Cordial in a bid to lift its stake from 5pc to at least 
50pc. It reserved the right to drop the bid if it could not secure a majority stake. 
The deal is Citigroup's largest in Asia to date, eclipsing the $2.8bn acquisition of South Korea's KorAm Bank in 
2004. 
It is also the first under chief executive Charles Prince, who took over after regulators shut down Citigroup's 
Japanese private bank over a series of compliance problems. 
It would also be the largest takeover of a Japanese company by a non-Japanese firm, edging out Vodafone's 
$7.6bn acquisition of Japan Telecom and its mobile unit J-Phone in 2001. 
The deal comes three years after Citigroup was forced to close down its Japanese private bank after regulators 
claimed the company was in violation of rules, including the level of controls it had put in place against money 
laundering. 
Mr Prince has since visited Tokyo three or four times a year to smooth things over with regulators. 
Nikko has its own problems, however. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is deliberating whether to strip it of its share 
listing over an accounting scandal in which the company admitted forging documents and booking about $300m 
in excess profits over two years. It has said it will make a decision in mid-March. 
The US bank could have scooped up Nikko more cheaply had it waited for a delisting, but analysts said that 
strategy would have carried risks. Nikko's clients and staff might have abandoned the firm had it been delisted 
before securing a buyer, and private equity funds might even have made a grab for its assets, such as its 
profitable mutual fund business and companies held by its merchant banking arm. 
Citigroup already has a joint venture with Nikko and once held a 25pc stake after helping to bail out the bank 
following another financial crisis in 1998. 
If it succeeds in building up Nikko once again, it will have done better than rivals. 
Merrill Lynch tried to build a Japanese retail broking business on the ruins of Yamaichi Securities, a rival to Nikko 
that collapsed in 1997, but the business folded a few years later after its spiralling losses peaked at an estimated 
$500m in 2001.

The Federal Reserve cleared Citigroup Inc. to pursue future acquisitions, lifting a yearlong restriction that was 
imposed following a string of scandals and regulatory missteps at the financial-services company. 
In a letter sent late Monday to Charles Prince, the company's chief executive, William L. Rutledge, executive vice 
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that Citigroup had made "significant progress" by 
implementing new internal compliance and risk-management programs, and therefore "the understanding that 
you would refrain from significant expansion is no longer in operation." 
The Fed issued its unusual prohibition in March 2005, demanding that Citigroup get its house in order following a 
string of problems, including run-ins with regulators over a bond-trading strategy in Europe -- that its traders 
dubbed "Dr. Evil" -- and activities that led to the loss of its private-banking license in Japan. 
The Fed's letter came just days after securities regulators in Australia accused Citigroup of insider trading. 
Citigroup has denied any wrongdoing and says it will "vigorously defend" its actions. While Citigroup executives 
and a team of in-house regulators from the Fed stay in regular contact, it is unclear whether the Fed considered 
the merits of the lawsuit filed by the Australian regulators before lifting the ban on acquisitions. 
A spokeswoman for the New York Fed declined to comment. 
Citigroup spent the better part of 2005 implementing what Mr. Prince dubbed his "five-point plan," a roadmap 
aimed at strengthening internal controls, employee training and communications within the bank. 
Mr. Prince, who will add the title of chairman later this month, reacted to the long-awaited news from the Fed by 
sending a companywide letter yesterday morning thanking Citigroup's 300,000 employees scattered around the 
world for their efforts. "Today we continue toward our goal of becoming the world's most respected global 
financial-services company." Mr. Prince wrote. "I am confident of the course we have set, and excited about our 
future." 
Still, in an interview, the CEO said he cautioned the company's top executives in an address, "Be careful. This 
was not a one-year plan. It is not as if we are done." 
Speculation has circulated for months that the Fed might soon loosen the reins on the New York-based bank after 
it became widely known that the company had entered the bidding for an estimated $3 billion majority stake in 
Guangdong Development Bank in China and a separate purchase of Finansbank, Turkey's eighth-largest bank by 
assets. Over the weekend, it was disclosed that the much smaller National Bank of Greece had beaten out 
Citigroup in the bidding for Finansbank. 
The Fed's Mr. Rutledge said in his letter that regulators would continue to "carefully review any expansion 
proposal undertaken by Citigroup." 
Mr. Prince, who took over as chief executive in October 2003, has told investors that 2006 is the year that the 
new management team he has assembled must execute and improve the company's bottom line. To do that, Mr. 
Prince and his team will have to expand its business in foreign markets, the company's top priority, and improve 
the operation of its consumer business in the U.S. 
Expectations by some investors that Citigroup will once again flex its financial muscle by going on a major 
acquisition spree will likely be disappointed. Mr. Prince said in the interview that the Fed's letter didn't alter his

commitment to expand the financial institution, which has $1.5 trillion in assets, by generating more profits from its 
existing businesses and expanding its reach to more customers overseas and domestically. 
"It does not change our priorities," Mr. Prince said. "We are just too big to just rely only on deals." 
However, Mr. Prince did say that deal-making isn't totally out of the question for Citigroup, a company with more 
than $28 billion in cash on its books at the end of last year. As examples of the types of deals Citigroup might do, 
Mr. Prince pointed to the company's April 2004 purchase of South Korea's KorAm Bank Co. for $2.7 billion; the 
purchase less than a year later of the 106-branch First American Bank in Texas for an undisclosed sum; and the 
acquisition earlier this year of OnTrade Inc., an electronic-trading platform bought for about $8 million. 
In 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Citigroup's shares were up 80 cents to $48.21.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Citigroup Inc. (C) Chief Executive Charles Prince said the company remains 
committed to growing internally, not through big acquisitions, even with the Federal Reserve lifting an order 
restricting major deals. 
'Our primary focus has to be on organic growth, and that's supplanted by transactions,' Prince said in an interview 
Tuesday. 
Citigroup, the world's biggest bank, would prefer international deals to U.S. acquisitions, Prince said. He's 
especially interested in countries 'with stable economies and rapidly emerging middle classes.' 
Wherever they take place, deals are likely to be on the smaller side. He said Citigroup's 2004 purchase of Korea's 
KorAm Bank Co. and last year's acquisition of First American Bank in Texas 'are the kinds of deals' Citigroup 
would be interested in replicating. 
Prince declined to comment on whether Citigroup was a bidder for Finansbank A.S. (FINBN.IS), Turkey's 
eighth-largest bank by assets, which is now being acquired by a Greek bank. But he said Citigroup would like to 
grow in Turkey - if the price is right. 
'Turkey is a very interesting country and we are very focused as an institution on not over-paying,' Prince said.

INTERVIEW-UPDATE 2-Citigroup CEO says major acquisition unlikely

(Adds details) 
NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Charles Prince said on Tuesday the bank was 
unlikely to pursue any large acquisitions even though the U.S. Federal Reserve had lifted a year-long ban on 
major deals, but he did not rule out smaller buys. 
"But I don't think you will see us going off to the races as our primary focus has to be on organic growth," Prince 
told Reuters in a telephone interview. 
"You never say never, but I think (a major acquisition) would be extremely unlikely given our focus and pricing the 
way things are. ... Most things are overpriced." 
Citibank was restricted in March 2005 by the Fed from "significant expansion" until it tightened internal controls 
after several ethical and regulatory issues emerged in the United States and Europe and Asia. 
Neither Citigroup nor the Federal Reserve has defined what exactly is meant by "significant expansion." 
Prince, 56, who took the helm of the world's largest financial services group in October 2003, said Citibank was 
so large that the real path for growth -- and for improving its stagnant share price -- was by extending its existing 
franchise. 
Growth internationally was a priority for the New York-based bank, but Prince said he would be interested only in 
strategic acquisitions at the right price. 
He cited as examples Citigroup's 2004 purchase of Korea's KorAm Bank for $2.7 billion, its purchase of First 
American Bank in Texas and electronic communications network OnTrade Inc. 
Prince, whose compensation rose 15 percent last year to $23 million, said he also wanted to extend Citigroup's 
reach within the United States. 
Earlier on Tuesday, the bank said it had teamed up with 7-Eleven Inc. to offer free ATM services to Citibank 
customers in more than 5,500 7-Eleven stores across the United States. Last week, Citigroup launched an online 
bank. 
This year Citigroup plans to open as many as 200 branches worldwide and 100 in the United States, as well as 
starting a mobile-phone banking service. 
INTERNATIONAL GROWTH PATH 
On the international front, Prince said, "We are doubling the size of our banking network in Russia." 
He declined to give details on Citibank's reported interest in Turkey's mid-size Finansbank , which has agreed to 
sell a 46 percent stake to Greece's National Bank . 
"I think Turkey is a very interesting market. We have a franchise there," said Prince, adding, "We are very focused 
on not overpaying on deals."

Page 11 of 40 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
Prince said he was "still hopeful" over China's Guangdong Development Bank, which is selling a controlling stake 
to foreign investors. 
Industry sources told Reuters last month that a Citigroup-led consortium had successfully bid $3.2 billion for 85 
percent of the struggling bank, but the deal was still waiting for special permission from the States Council, 
China's cabinet. 
"It is a very important transaction for the Chinese. They are reviewing it carefully. One has to be patient," he said. 
Prince said he hoped the lifting of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's bar on major acquisitions would help 
Citigroup's share price, which has been stagnant over the past two years. 
Citigroup's shares are unchanged since the start of 2004, lagging a 10 percent rise in the Philadelphia KGB Bank 
Index <.BKX>. Its shares were up 1.9 percent at $48.31 on Tuesday. 
"I hope this has a positive effect but I don't think it will have a major positive effect," said Prince. 
"The market has not been in favor of large-cap U.S. stocks for a while or large international franchises. I think the 
stock has been doing better recently."

(Adds quotes from Prince interview, details, share price) 
NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Citigroup , the world's largest financial services group, was freed on Tuesday 
from a year-long ban on big mergers as U.S. regulators said the bank had made significant strides in improving its 
internal controls. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York had imposed the ban in March 2005 as Citigroup bought privately held 
First American Bank, telling the New York-based bank to hold off on big takeovers until it tightened internal 
controls following a slew of ethical and regulatory problems in Europe, Asia and the United States. 
But William Rutledge, executive vice president of the New York Fed, said in a letter released on Tuesday that 
Citigroup had made "significant progress" in implementing its new compliance risk management program over the 
past year. 
"Consequently, the understanding that you would refrain from significant expansion is no longer in operation," 
Rutledge wrote in the letter, dated April 3, adding that the Fed would carefully review any future expansion 
proposal by Citigroup. 
Chief Executive Charles Prince, who has implemented a five-step plan to tighten up on compliance, said the 
decision by the Fed, the main U.S. bank regulator, freed up Citigroup; but he stressed his main focus was internal 
growth. 
He all but ruled out any large acquisitions while leaving the door open to smaller purchases. 
"You never say never, but I think (a major acquisition) would be extremely unlikely given our focus and pricing the 
way things are ... Most things are overpriced," Prince said in an interview with Reuters. 
Prince signaled last December that Citigroup would be seeking to expand globally this year, to boost growth and 
reinvigorate a stagnant share price, and it has begun this process. 
EYEING INTERNATIONAL GROWTH 
It is seeking to win control of China's Guangdong Development Bank, with industry sources saying a Citigroup-led 
group had successfully bid $3.2 billion for 85 percent of the ailing bank. 
The deal is waiting for special permission from Chinese authorities but Prince said he was "still hopeful." 
"It is a very important transaction for the Chinese. They are reviewing it carefully. One has to be patient," he said. 
He declined to comment on Citibank's reported interest in Turkey's mid-size Finansbank , which has agreed to 
sell a 46 percent stake to Greece's National Bank . 
"I think Turkey is a very interesting market." he said, adding: "We are very focused on not overpaying on deals." 
Prince said Citigroup would be interested in strategic acquisitions at the right price, citing as examples its 
purchase of South Korea's KorAm Bank Co., First American Bank in Texas, and OnTrade Inc., an electronic 
trading platform.

Page 13 of 40 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
But Prince underlined the main focus was organic growth, with plans to open 200 new branches in 2006. 
In a separate announcement on Tuesday, Citigroup's Citibank said it had struck a deal to provide ATMs in more 
than 5,500 7-Eleven stores in the United States as it tries to reverse a decline in consumer banking profit. 
Last week Citigroup launched on online bank. 
Prince's drive to clean up several costly ethics and regulatory problems since becoming chief executive in 
October 2003 did suffer a minor setback last week -- with Citigroup sued for insider trading by Australia's 
securities regulator. 
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission said Citigroup's wrongdoing took place as the bank 
advised transport group Toll Holdings Ltd. on a $3.3 billion (A$4.6 billion) bid for rival Patrick Corp Ltd. . 
The bank denies any wrongdoing but faces a possible fine of $714,000 (A$1 million) as the commission plans to 
seek orders directing the bank to strengthen conflict-of-interests procedures and to stop it from trading shares of 
companies it advises on deals. 
Citigroup also still faces a $10 billion lawsuit for its role in the insolvency of Italian dairy company Parmalat . 
The bank has resolved several other disputes. 
The bank paid $4.6 billion to settle lawsuits over its role in the failures of energy trader Enron Corp. and phone

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Citigroup Inc. (C) Chief Executive Charles Prince said the company remains 
committed to growing internally, not through big acquisitions, even with the Federal Reserve lifting an order 
restricting major deals. 
"Our primary focus has to be on organic growth, and that's supplanted by transactions," Prince said in an 
interview Tuesday. 
Citigroup, the world's biggest bank, would prefer international deals to U.S. acquisitions, Prince said. He's 
especially interested in countries "with stable economies and rapidly emerging middle classes." 
Wherever they take place, deals are likely to be on the smaller side. He said Citigroup's 2004 purchase of Korea's 
KorAm Bank Co. and last year's acquisition of First American Bank in Texas "are the kinds of deals" Citigroup 
would be interested in replicating. 
Prince declined to comment on whether Citigroup was a bidder for Finansbank A.S. (FINBN.IS), Turkey's 
eighth-largest bank by assets, which is now being acquired by a Greek bank. But he said Citigroup would like to 
grow in Turkey - if the price is right. 
"Turkey is a very interesting country and we are very focused as an institution on not over-paying," Prince said.

(Adds information about Citigroup expansion plans in 8th through 11th paragraphs.) 
By David Enrich 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The Federal Reserve gave Citigroup Inc. (C) the green light to pursue future 
acquisitions, lifting a year-long restriction that was imposed following a string of scandals. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a letter sent Monday to Citigroup Chief Executive Charles Prince, 
said the New York-based bank, the world's largest, has made "significant progress" in implementing its new 
compliance risk management program. 
"Consequently, the understanding that you would refrain from significant expansion is no longer in operation," 
said the letter, signed by William L. Rutledge, the New York Fed's executive vice-president. 
The Fed's letter ends a period of ambiguity over whether Citigroup was in a position to do major deals. After 
spending much of last year implementing a "five-point" ethics plan, Prince recently has been trumpeting the 
company's success at cleaning up its governance and internal controls. Adding to the perception that Citigroup 
believed it was free to expand, the company recently was a bidder for a major Turkish bank, although it lost out to 
a Greek bank. 
Last week, however, Australian regulators accused Citigroup of insider trading, a development that some 
observers thought would worry the Fed and make it less likely that the agency would lift last year's order 
restricting significant acquisitions. 
The Fed's decision to loosen its vise on "significant" acquisitions is the latest sign pointing to a possible era of 
rapid expansion at Citigroup. Not only is the company now free to go after big bank deals, but it also was already 
planning swift growth in its retail-banking business in the U.S. and overseas. 
That effort includes adding hundreds of bank branches and consumer-finance centers nationwide this year. On 
Tuesday, in the latest initiative, Citigroup unveiled a deal to put branded ATMs in more than 5,500 7-Eleven Inc. 
stores in 31 states. 
The move - the largest partnership to date between a retail bank and a convenience-store chain - will quintuple 
Citibank's number of U.S. ATM locations, the company said. It also will put Citibank on the ground in many parts 
of the country where it previously lacked a bricks-and-mortar banking presence. 
Playing Down Big Deals 
Analysts said the lifting of the acquisition ban, while anticipated, was good news for Citigroup. But that doesn't 
mean a shopping spree is imminent.

Page 17 of 40 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
In recent months, Prince has played down the odds of doing "transformational" acquisitions - especially in the 
U.S. retail-banking arena, where he says Citigroup is no longer holding out for a "big deal." But Prince has 
allowed for the possibility of modest domestic or international deals that would fill geographic or product voids. 
Citigroup apparently is eyeing international expansion opportunities. In addition to the unsuccessful bid for 
Finansbank A.S. (FINBN.IS), Turkey's eighth-largest bank by assets, Citigroup also reportedly has been in talks 
to acquire a big stake in a Chinese lender. 
Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said Citigroup may now aim for "medium-sized" deals in 
countries like Brazil, China, Korea, Russia and Turkey. Goldberg, in a note to clients, pointed to Citigroup's $2.6 
billion 2004 acquisition of KorAm Bank Co. as a model for future deals. Citigroup is a Lehman 
investment-banking client. 
In a memo Tuesday to Citigroup employees, Prince said he was "very pleased" by the New York Fed's letter. 
"This accomplishment is a testament to your hard work and commitment to our company's success," Prince 
wrote. "We dedicated ourselves to our shared responsibilities to our clients, to each other and to our great 
franchise, and we strengthened our controls, compliance and culture through the Five Point Plan, which we 
continue to implement." 
The New York Fed emphasized that while the ban is no longer in effect, that doesn't mean Citigroup has carte 
blanche to do deals. Rutledge's letter said regulators "will carefully review any expansion proposal undertaken by 
Citigroup in accordance with all applicable statutory requirements and cannot, at this time, express any view on 
whether those requirements would be met regarding any specific proposal." 
Investors had a limited reaction to the news. Citigroup shares climbed about 0.8% to $47.78 each.

Citigroup Loses to Greek Bank In Fight for Turkey's Finansbank 
Citigroup Loses to Greek Bank In Fight for Turkey's Finansbank

National Bank of Greece edged Citigroup Inc. to win the bidding for Finansbank, a large Turkish bank, with a 
purchase valued at 5.5 billion euros ($6.67 billion), according to people familiar with the situation. 
NBG's victory may prove a disappointment for Citigroup, which has about two dozen branches in Turkey and has 
been operating in the country since 1975. The New York bank's big competitors, including HSBC Holdings PLC of 
the United Kingdom, have been expanding in Turkey. Last year, General Electric Co. acquired a 25.5% stake in 
Garanti Bank, another Turkish banking company. 
Turkey also had been on Citigroup Chief Executive Charles Prince's target list of faster-growing emerging 
markets along with countries such as Brazil, Russia and Chile for retail expansion. If Citigroup had been 
successful, it would have marked Citigroup's first significant bank acquisition since it paid $2.7 billion for KorAm 
Bank, a commercial bank in South Korea, in 2004. 
Under the deal to acquire Finansbank, NBG, Greece's oldest bank, will buy the stake held by Fiba Holding, the 
Turkish concern that owns or controls about 46% of the bank. Fiba, under chairman Husnu Ozyegin, put the bank 
in play last November, sparking months of bidding that culminated in offers being made over the past week. Mr. 
Ozyegin, a banker, also is expected to retain a role along with Finansbank's current management. 
In addition, NBG is likely to sell back to Fiba the Russian and Romanian operations of Finansbank. The banks 
and bidders either declined to comment or weren't available for comment. 
NBG's flexibility in working with Finansbank and Fiba -- and the hefty price that NBG has agreed to pay -- likely 
separated its bid from Citigroup's. Citigroup is the largest bank in the world, with a market capitalization of some 
$238 billion; NBG's market capitalization is $15 billion. 
Foreign banks, stymied by slow growth in their home markets, have plowed into Central and Eastern Europe in 
recent years to take advantage of largely "unbanked" markets that have strong appetites for credit. It was that 
growth that made Finansbank an important, if expensive, target. NBG also had signaled to investors and analysts 
that it planned to bid aggressively for Finansbank because it saw the purchase as a way to build a Eastern 
European platform. 
NBG's victory was previously reported on the Web site of the Financial Times.

CITIGROUP INC.'S Charles Prince is considering making a big bet on Turkey. 
A year after the U.S. Federal Reserve effectively barred Citigroup from doing any "significant" merger deals, the 
Citigroup chief executive officer is expected to submit a final cash bid to acquire some or all of Finansbank, 
Turkey's eighth-largest bank by assets, in a transaction that could be valued at $5 billion or more, according to 
people familiar with the matter. 
The only other institution that remains in the lengthy auction process is National Bank of Greece. The two banks 
were expected to submit their bids yesterday, these people say, and the winner could be known within a week. 
Either bank could still decide against entering the final bidding round, these people add, but as of Monday night, 
the banks and their boards were putting the final touches on their submissions. 
Officials at Citigroup, NBG and Finansbank declined to comment. 
If Citigroup is successful, it would mark its first significant bank acquisition since it paid $2.7 billion for KorAm 
Bank, a commercial bank in South Korea, in April 2004. It also would be the biggest deal since Mr. Prince 
became chief executive in late 2003, succeeding Sanford I. Weill. 
Mr. Weill built Citigroup into the world's largest financial-services institution through a series of acquisitions in the 
1990s. Since Mr. Prince -- Mr. Weill's longtime right-hand man -- became CEO, he has concentrated on moving 
the bank beyond a series of embarrassments and scandals that prompted the Fed in March 2005 to caution 
Citigroup against pursuing any major expansions until its regulatory house was in order. 
Mr. Prince, who also was recently given the additional title of Citigroup chairman, said in the company's recent 
annual report that by the end of last year, the bank was confident its efforts to improve its operations had been 
favorably received by regulators. A Fed spokesman declined to comment. 
Mr. Prince and other Citigroup officials have said they are interested in smaller deals and ones in faster-growing 
emerging markets to boost Citigroup's revenue and to try to raise its ailing share price. 
In the past year, Citigroup's shares have risen about 7%, compared with rivals such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., 
whose shares have risen 21%, and the Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Bank Index, which measures two dozen large 
U.S. financial-services firms and has risen 13%. 
Mr. Prince has said he wants to beef up Citigroup's already substantial international presence. Among the 
countries Citigroup officials view as the most attractive areas for retail-banking expansion are Brazil, Russia and 
Chile, as well as Turkey, where the economy has been on a tear and the nation's population of 72 million is 
considered "underbanked" by Western standards. 
Citigroup is hardly the only global bank with an interest in the nation. London's HSBC Holdings PLC is active 
there and is showing increased interest in Central and Eastern Europe as a whole. And General Electric Co. last 
year purchased a 25.5% stake in Garanti Bank, another Turkish institution. 
Citigroup, with a market value of about $241 billion, far outweighs NBG, which is Greece's oldest bank, with a 
market value of $15 billion. People familiar with the matter say NBG views Finansbank as a key strategic asset, 
so it may be willing to drive up the price at the auction, which is being handled by Morgan Stanley.

Finansbank, founded in 1987, began as a corporate bank but has moved increasingly into retail and has bulked 
up its credit-card business. Finansbank's branch network now stands at more than 200 branches. The bank also 
has built smaller networks of three dozen branches apiece in Russia and Romania, two markets that have 
attracted increasing interest from Western banks. 
According to people familiar with the bidding, Citigroup and NBG could bid for all of Finansbank, which would 
include the Russian and Romanian units, or just its Turkish operations. Finansbank's net income in 2005 rose 
68% to $359.1 million from $214.2 million in 2004. Finansbank's Harvard-educated founder, Husnu Ozyegin, 
oversees the bank through a holding company called Fiba Holding but its shares are publicly traded in Istanbul. 
Finansbank's market value is approximately $5 billion. 
A winning bid won't come cheap. Finansbank's shares have tripled in the past year on the Istanbul Stock 
Exchange along with many other shares in Turkey. The country has been an attractive investment for money 
managers seeking higher returns than have been available in many more mature markets. Citigroup's own 
economic-research team issued a report last week that Turkish stocks were overheated. The report, which noted 
a 500% increase in Turkish stocks over the past three years, told investors, "Risks outweigh rewards -- time to 
take profits." 
There also is some geopolitical risk for Citigroup as it seeks to increase its presence in a country where some 
Western companies and governments have drawn anti-Western sentiment. Citigroup already has a system of two 
dozen branches as well as a corporate bank and wouldn't be new to the region.

Citigroup Inc.'s Charles Prince is considering a big bet on Turkey. 
After a year when U.S. regulators effectively barred Citigroup from doing a major deal, the Citigroup chief 
executive is expected to submit a final cash bid for some or all of Finansbank AS, Turkey's eighth-largest bank by 
assets, in a deal valued at as much as $5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The only other institution that remains in the lengthy auction process is National Bank of Greece. The two banks 
are expected to submit their bids today, these people said, and the winner could be known within a week. Either

executive in late 2003, succeeding Sanford I. Weill. 
Mr. Weill built Citigroup into the world's largest financial-services firm through a series of acquisitions in the 1990s 
and was one of the legendary deal makers of his generation. But since Mr. Prince -- Mr. Weill's longtime adviser -- 
became CEO, he has concentrated on moving the bank beyond a series of scandals that prompted the U.S. 
Federal Reserve in March 2005 to caution Citigroup against pursuing any more major purchases until its house 
was in order. 
That restriction now appears to be lifted. Mr. Prince, who also was recently given the additional title of Citigroup 
chairman, said in the company's recent annual report that by the end of last year, the bank was confident its 
efforts to improve its operations had been favorably received. A Fed spokesman declined to comment.

financial-services firms, which has risen 13%. Midafternoon yesterday in New York, Citigroup shares were down 
29 cents at $47.52. 
Mr. Prince has said he wants to beef up Citigroup's substantial international presence. Among the countries 
Citigroup officials view as the most attractive areas for retail-banking expansion are Brazil, Russia, Chile and 
Turkey, where the economy has been on a tear and the nation's population of 70 million has less access to 
mainstream financial services than its Western counterparts. 
Citigroup is hardly the only global bank with an interest in Turkey. London's HSBC Holdings PLC is active there 
and is showing increased interest in Central and Eastern Europe as a whole. General Electric Co. last year 
purchased a 25.5% stake in Garanti Bank, another Turkish bank.

There is some geopolitical risk for Citigroup as it seeks to increase its presence in a country where some Western 
companies and governments have drawn anti-Western sentiment. In 2003, suicide bombers staged attacks on 
two synagogues, a British consulate and the local headquarters of HSBC in Turkey. But Citigroup has a branch 
system of two dozen branches as well as a corporate bank and wouldn't be new to the region. 
And Citigroup, according to a recent UBS AG analyst report, quietly has been upgrading and integrating a 
back-office computer platform in Europe that would conveniently tie together its systems throughout the region, 
meaning it could potentially squeeze out significant costs.

NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Nearly seven years after Citigroup Inc. defied U.S. law by merging bank, 
insurance and brokerage businesses under one red umbrella, the financial giant is conceding the combination 
wasn't such a great idea after all. 
Citigroup on Monday agreed to sell most of Travelers Life & Annuity to MetLife Inc. for $11.5 billion in cash and 
stock, ending its involvement in the underwriting of insurance policies. 
The reason, Citigroup officials and analysts said, is that insurance is less profitable and grows more slowly than 
other financial businesses. 
"Insurance in general is a lower (return-on-equity) business than banking. No matter how you slice it, it never 
musters the same power," said Sandler O'Neill & Partners strategist Robert Albertson. 
Congress in 1999 overhauled Depression-era laws that built walls between banking, insurance and brokerage. 
The changes came a year after Sandy Weill's Travelers Group Inc., which had insurance and brokerage and 
capital markets businesses, merged with global commercial banking giant Citicorp, essentially forcing lawmakers' 
hands. 
The deal was expected to trigger a wave of bank-insurance combinations, creating more European-style 
"universal" banks with insurance, brokerage and banking under one roof. A number of small and regional banks 
bought insurance agencies, but no big U.S. banks ever followed Citigroup's lead in diving into the underwriting 
business. 
"Citi found that it was unnecessary. The business combination didn't work out they way they expected," said Dick 
Bove, banking analyst at Punk, Ziegel & Co. 
Citigroup spun off 90 percent of Travelers Property Casualty Corp. two years ago. 
With the MetLife deal, about all that remains of Travelers at Citigroup is the red umbrella logo. 
INSURANCE DOESN'T STICK 
Analysts said Citigroup's plan to offer "one-stop shopping" for financial services to its millions of banking 
customers, a core premise for the merger, didn't pan out. Companies and consumers continued to buy insurance 
through agents or direct sales. 
"There were not as many cross-selling opportunities for banks as originally anticipated," said Andrew Collins, a 
banking analyst with Piper Jaffrey. 
Meanwhile, Citigroup had to set aside billions of dollars to support its insurance activities, hurting overall returns. 
Without insurance, analysts said, the company will generate more earnings growth and higher profit margins and 
command a higher stock price. 
The MetLife deal comes as Citigroup Chief Executive Charles Prince whittles down the company's sprawling 
collection of businesses.

NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Nearly seven years after Citigroup Inc. (C.N) defied U.S. law by merging bank,

Citigroup, the world's biggest bank, whose chairman, Sandy Weill, has lost the confidence of one of its major 
shareholders, yesterday quashed rumours that it was preparing to make a large banking acquisition, as it 
reported a fifth quarter of record profits. 
The group, touted as a bidder for Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, said that it preferred to look for 
smaller, strategic acquisitions. 
Charles Prince, the chief executive, said: "We are not trying to shoot a moose for everybody to feed on." 
Citigroup recently outbid the UK's Standard Chartered to take control of Koram Bank, based in South Korea, in a 
$2.7 billion (Pounds 1.51 billion) deal. 
Yesterday Mr Prince said that Asia would become an increasingly important part of Citigroup's business. 
Earnings from the region rose 49 per cent in the first three months of the year. 
Mr Prince said the record quarter had been helped by rising revenues at its investment banking division and 
higher earnings from lending money to American consumers. 
Net profits at the bank rose to $5.27 billion for the first quarter, a rise of nearly a third on last year's first quarter, 
when the bank was still reeling from a series of scandals over conflicts of interest. 
Mr Prince said six of the bank's nine businesses had produced record quarterly earnings. "This demonstrates our 
ability to capitalise on the global recovery in the economy. We achieved double-digit income growth in each of our 
nine products, as well as in every one of our regions." 
Citigroup said first-quarter net profit had swelled to $5.27 billion, up 29 per cent from the first quarter of 2003 
when it banked $4.10 billion. 
Revenues soared 16 per cent to $21.5 billion in the first quarter from the same period a year ago. Mr Prince said 
higher profits had been realised through cost controls, an effort to ramp up customer volumes and improving 
credit performance. 
Profits from the global corporate and investment banking business rose 22 per cent to $1.71 billion as revenues 
grew 8 per cent to $5.47 billion. The bank said that strong growth in its investment bank, which has a large 
presence in the City of London, would continue. Todd Thomson, Citigroup finance director, said: "We have 
eliminated the overhang from the boom times." 
Income from private wealth management rose 55 per cent lifting first-quarter profits to $251 million. Talks on a 
takeover of Deutsche Bank, which emerged earlier this year, are thought to have foundered because of the legal 
wrangle between Josef Ackermann, Deutsche's chief executive, and German prosecutors investigating the 
bonuses granted to executives during Vodafone's takeover of Mannesmann.

Citigroup Looks Beyond Home --- Growth Strategy Includes Global Service Expansion, Leaving Rivals Behind 
Citigroup Looks Beyond Home --- Growth Strategy Includes Global Service Expansion, Leaving Rivals

WHILE ITS BIGGEST American rivals zig, Citigroup Inc. is zagging. 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. grabbed headlines in recent months with enormous 
acquisitions to beef up their retail-banking operations in the U.S. Citigroup unveiled smaller and seemingly riskier 
ventures such as the $2.73 billion acquisition of KorAm Bank, a midsize South Korean lender, and in China, the 
rollout of the first credit card issued by a foreign bank that can be settled in yuan. 
"We have largely accomplished the strategic build-out in the U.S., and we are now ready to project our products 
and services globally," said Deryck Maughan, chairman and chief executive of Citigroup's international 
operations. Citigroup, the world's largest financial-services firm, aims to move quickly, he added, while other 
American money-center banks "seek to do part of what we did five years ago." 
To explain, he turns to the world almanac according to Citigroup. 
-- World population living outside of the U.S. and Canada: 95%. 
-- Portion of world's gross domestic product generated in that area: 65%. 
-- Citigroup earnings generated in the rest of the world: 35%. 
When Citigroup stacks up these figures, it sees two big opportunities: First, to aggressively expand its 
consumer-banking presence outside the U.S. to boost profits. Second, to leave behind rival American banks only 
now moving to copy Citigroup's model of marrying domestic corporate and consumer banking in the U.S. 
Citigroup's main competitors in the push to expand internationally, in fact, aren't U.S. banks at all. London's HSBC 
Holdings PLC boasts that its earnings already are spread around the globe more evenly than Citigroup's. And 
both General Electric Co. and insurance giant American International Group already have considerable 
consumer-finance businesses around the globe. 
HSBC also aims to expand its consumer-finance operations in emerging markets and has purchased financial 
firms in Mexico and Brazil. "I think it's fair to say we're the most international bank in the world," an HSBC 
spokesman said. 
The way Citigroup executives see it, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase will have their hands full for a 
couple of years digesting their large domestic mergers. That will afford Citigroup "a couple of years of free running 
room," said one senior Citigroup executive, "to continue to invest overseas and make it difficult to catch us." 
Under the leadership of Walter Wriston and John Reed, Citigroup's predecessor Citicorp billed itself as a bank 
that could serve businesses and wealthy individuals far beyond the U.S. border. Citigroup's recent global initiative 
was begun by Chairman and former Chief Executive Sanford Weill, but has been ramped up by current Chief 
Executive Charles Prince. It constitutes an attempt to tap into the big new middle class emerging in developing 
economies from Poland to India to China. 
But going global isn't necessarily easy. Citigroup was torched by some earlier incursions into emerging markets. 
The Latin America debt crisis of the 1980s forced it to set aside about $3 billion in reserves. It had a substantial 
loss in 1998 from the market turmoil stemming from Russia's debt default, and two years ago stumbled in 
Argentina.

Page 31 of 40 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
The risks associated with its current efforts are numerous: China's credit-card culture is in its infancy, its financial 
system riddled with problems. In South Korea, bad credit-card debt recently produced losses for some local 
lenders. The risk of currency devaluations and investor flight of the sort that struck Asia in 1997 and 1998 is 
omnipresent, as is the danger of seismic political upheaval. 
But the maturity of the U.S. consumer-finance market, evidenced by the saturation of its credit-card market, gives 
Citigroup little choice if it wants to increase growth and expand profit margins. In November, Mr. Prince told 
investors that he expected six to eight more acquisitions in emerging markets of financial-services franchises over 
the coming decade. In a recent tour of Europe, he told investors that Citigroup's goal over the next decade is to 
increase non-American and non-Canadian earnings to one half of its total earnings, up from a third. 
"The volatility around these businesses is greater," said Michael Holton, who invests in financial stocks and holds 
Citigroup shares as a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price Group Inc. "That's the price you pay for smaller markets 
with significant growth trajectories." But given Citigroup's global diversification, he said, "they can absorb a blow 
or two in different markets and still chug along." 
Citigroup has targeted 14 countries where it will try to triple its credit-card business in the next seven years, says 
Mr. Maughan, who declines to name them. He has set similar goals for consumer finance, and aims to build retail 
branches as quickly as possible in 20 countries. 
In less than 40 years, the combined economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China -- the BRICs economies -- 
could become larger than the combined economies of the U.S., the U.K., Japan, Germany, France and Italy, 
according to a Goldman Sachs research report last year. 
With China set to open its banking sector to foreign competition by 2007 under World Trade Organization 
guidelines, Mr. Maughan said he is proceeding under the assumption that three or four foreign financial-services 
firms will be allowed in. "My job is to make sure Citi is one of them," he said. During the past year, he said, at 
least one top Citigroup executive has visited China each month.When Citigroup assessed the Indian population 
using U.S. credit standards for credit cards, retail banking and consumer finance, it discovered a potentially large 
customer base for everything from credit cards to installment loans. 
In Europe, Citigroup also has expressed interest in increasing its consumer-finance business, particularly in 
Germany, where it already has a profitable business. Recent reports of talks with Deutsche Bank AG, which led 
nowhere, stirred speculation. "It would be nice to buy a retail bank, if we were able to transform it," said Mr. 
Maughan. "But we don't need to." 
"We're not betting the company anywhere," said Mr. Maughan. "What do you do in new markets? You walk before 
you run. . . . And if you're wrong, you stop."

Deutsche Bk Up 7% On Renewed Citigroup Takeover Bid Talk 
Deutsche Bk Up 7% On Renewed Citigroup Takeover Bid Talk

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Deutsche Bank AG (DB) American depositary receipts jumped 7% Thursday on 
renewed market speculation that Citigroup Inc. (C) is considering buying the German commercial bank. 
Both Citigroup and Deutsche Bank said they don't comment on rumors and speculation. 
A number of traders and market watchers said they have heard the rumor Thursday. One trader, who didn't want 
to be identified, said the talk on Wall Street is Citigroup bidding $110, or 90 euros a share, for Deutsche Bank. 
Dick Bove, banking analyst at Hoefer & Arnett, said he has also heard the rumor with a price of 90 euros. Based 
on Deutsche Bank's Wednesday closing price of $87.68, it would be about a 20% premium, he said. 
Another market watcher noted that $99 a share, or a 5% premium from its most recent price of $93.78, is the 
price talk circulating among traders. 
Market players weren't surprised to hear that Citigroup may consider acquiring Deutsche Bank as rumors of a 
possible deal between the two had been circulating on trading floors for months. 
Trading volumes for both companies are well above average daily volume. Shares of Deutsche Bank recently 
climbed $6.05, or 6.9%, to $93.73 on volume of 791,700 shares. Average daily volume is 89,923. 
Citigroup dipped 36 cents, or 0.7%, to $49.46 on volume of 14.05 million shares. Average daily volume is 11.47 
million. [ 03-04-04 1426ET ] 
Sources familiar with the bank said the latest speculation is just rumor, noting the upbeat goals Deutsche Bank 
Chief Executive Josef Ackermann laid out at the 2003 earnings call last month. At the time, Ackermann called for 
a higher return on equity and emphasized a commitment to Deutsche Bank's standalone strategy. 
Sources within the industry said the rumors may have been fueled as Citigroup Chief Executive Charles Prince 
meets investors in Europe as part of a road show. 
Along with the stock market, option markets were responding to the speculation. U.S. bullish short-term calls were 
also more active than usual. 
Analysts said a merger with Citigroup would be politically difficult given the sheer size of the combined entity and 
issues with European regulators. 
"It would be a challenge," said Jeffery Harte, senior research analyst at Sandler O'Neill. "It would be difficult 
because they would have to get regulatory approval from the EU, domestically here in the U.S. and I don't know 
how well the two companies would" mesh culturally. 
Harte said there's little reason for Citigroup to acquire Deutsche Bank because Citigroup already has a strong 
retail banking franchise in Germany and a strong corporate presence globally. Deutsche Bank's trading 
operations are its "crown jewel" but Citigroup also has a solid trading business, so a major deal wouldn't be a 
good strategic fit. 
Hoefer & Arnett's Bove said a deal would be unlikely because Germany wouldn't likely approve such a merger.

Page 35 of 40 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. 
"The bank is associated with Germany going back decades," he said. "It would be akin to a loss of national pride 
and politically would be totally unacceptable." 
But media reports early this year sparked some of the speculation after a Financial Times article indicated 
Citigroup had asked German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder if his government would block a takeover of 
Deutsche Bank. Reports indicated that Schroeder wouldn't oppose a merger. 
In February, however, media reports indicated that Deutsche Bank and Citigroup had cut off exploratory talks 
after Deutsche Bank's Ackermann decided the move would be too politically controversial, while Citigroup 
decided that it didn't need to buy a German bank given its strong position in the country. 
Bove said Citigroup is looking to expand internationally, but Asia seems a more likely target, given the 
fast-growing economies and large populations in markets such as China and India. 
Citigroup recently bought South Korea's KorAm Bank (016830.SE) for $2.7 billion - a move analysts said showed 
the company's commitment to expanding its emerging market strategy. 
As for Deutsche Bank, rumor mills aren't only calling for Citigroup as a potential buyer. Zurich-based Credit 
Suisse Group (CSR) is also emerging as an acquirer after the bank's co-Chief Executive Oswald Gruebel told a 
German newspaper late last year considering buying a German company in order to enter the slim-margin retail 
banking business. 
Hoefer & Arnett's Bove doesn't own shares of any of the stocks mentioned in the story, and his firm doesn't have 
an investment banking relationship. 
Sandler O'Neill's Hart doesn't own shares, but his firm has received compensation for investment banking from 
Citigroup.

Citigroup may grow more in consumer, outside U.S.

NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc.'s deal to buy South Korea's KorAm Bank for $2.73 billion likely 
foreshadows more non-U.S. and consumer banking purchases for the world's largest financial services company, 
analysts said on Monday. 
"The financial world is getting smaller and smaller," said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset 
Advisors Inc., whose $1.4 billion of assets include Citigroup shares. "That means that instead of looking at one 
finite area in the United States, Citigroup must look at the opportunity costs and growth prospects elsewhere." 
Beating out Britain's Standard Chartered Plc (STAN.L), Citigroup (C.N) on Sunday agreed to pay $1 billion for a 
36.6 percent stake in KoRam and will tender for the remainder, including 9.8 percent owned by Standard 
Chartered. 
The purchase would create South Korea's fifth largest bank, adding about 6 million customers in the country to 
Citigroup's 1 million, 3.4 million credit card customers to Citigroup's 600,000, and 222 branches to Citigroup's 12. 
"As we look forward over the next five to 10 years, it's clear to us that international markets will grow faster than 
the U.S. (and) will have higher returns," said Deryck Maughan, Citigroup International's chief executive, in an 
interview. 
Under Charles Prince, who became chief executive in October, Citigroup has expanded its U.S. consumer 
business. It bought Washington Mutual Inc.'s (WM.N) consumer finance unit for $1.25 billion and completed its 
roughly $3 billion purchase of Sears, Roebuck & Co.'s (S.N) credit card unit. 
Citigroup faces growing U.S. competition from No. 2 rival J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM.N), which agreed to pay 
$58 billion for Bank One Corp. (ONE.N), and No. 3 Bank of America Corp. (BAC.N), which agreed to pay $47 
billion for FleetBoston Financial Corp. (FBF.N) 
Citigroup's last major purchase was in 2001, when it paid $12.5 billion for Mexico's Grupo Financiero 
Banamex-Accival. This month it launched its first credit card in China. 
'WHOLE GLOBE' 
"When we look out and think about spending 45 or 50 billion dollars, we have to look at the whole globe," Chief 
Operating Officer Robert Willumstad said in a Feb. 12 presentation. 
He said Citigroup may grow in South Korea, Brazil, China and India, and expects to be a significant player in 
large population centers. He said Citigroup would also like to grow in the New York City area, California, Florida 
and Texas. 
"Citigroup is very good at deploying its own capital, unlike some other financial institutions," said Gordon Fowler, 
chief investment officer at Philadelphia's Glenmede Trust Co., whose $15 billion of assets include Citigroup 
shares. 
"The interesting thing here is that at a point where many in the investment community are looking at the retail 
market as potentially being at a top, Citigroup is continuing to invest, but in a fairly unique way" by targeting 
emerging markets, Fowler added.

Citigroup in 2003 had profit of $17.9 billion, up 17 percent from a year earlier, including $9.85 billion from its 
consumer business. Profit in Mexico, Latin America, Europe and Asia was $6.36 billion, up 18 percent, and its 
non-Japanese Asian business took in $1.77 billion, up 14 percent. 
"We view Asia, as a whole, as relatively stable economically, and with very good economic prospects," Maughan 
said. "We would like to play a prominent financial role."

KorAm to Become Citibank Branch. 
KorAm to Become Citibank Branch.

The name KorAm Bank may disappear from the local banking industry as Citigroup is seeking to run the nation's 
11 
sup>th 
/sup> largest lender as a branch, not a subsidiary. 
It means KorAm would no longer be a Korean bank but instead part of Citigroup. Its shares would be de-listed 
from the Korea Stock Exchange (KSE). 
Citibank is aiming to purchase all publicly traded shares of KorAm. Overall, foreign investors control a 90 percent 
stake of KorAm, and Citibank has approached 20 foreign institutional investors for the proposed purchase. 
Sources said that after buying the remaining 10 percent stake held by Korean shareholders, Citibank plans to 
de-list KorAm Bank from the KSE. It is also reported that KorAm would probably be renamed "Citibank Korea.". 
De-listing KorAm from the main bourse and running it as a branch means that Citibank will do business here more 
independently and aggressively, as it would be further away from the radar of financial regulators. 
"Citibank has been very cooperative to the Korean government so far, in particular during the course of 
overcoming the 1997 financial crisis," a Financial Supervisory Service official said. 
"But I doubt that Citibank will show a consistent attitude toward us even after acquiring the Korean lender," he 
added. 
Citibank's move is seen as part of Citigroup's global market expansion strategy, which has been pursued since 
Charles Prince was installed as chairman and CEO in October last year. 
Experts say that considering Citibank's advanced know-how and aggressive marketing, its acquisition of KorAm 
would intensify competition in South Korea's retail banking market. 
"Citigroup's acquisition of KorAm would escalate the competition in the domestic financial market while it could 
bring about a great change in financial supervision based on international standards," Korea Institute of Finance 
researcher Lee Byung-yoon said. 
"And unlike private equity funds, such as Carlyle Group and Lone Star, Citibank will bring in advanced financial 
methods and practices, playing the role of impetus to upgrade the local financial market," he added. 
But a number of local bankers expressed concerns that the acquisition will pose a big threat to domestic players 
in the retail banking sector. 
Last year, Kookmin Bank president Kim Jung-tae said the takeover of KorAm by foreign banks such as Citibank 
could pose a bigger threat to the nation's largest lender than the merger of several local banks whose strengths 
and weaknesses are known. 
Market analysts pointed out that if Citibank does decide to engage in the domestic market fully, it will probably 
concentrate on retail banking, forecasting Citibank will go after the top 20 percent of financial customers. 
Meanwhile, Carlyle and Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) are widely expected to make a considerable profit from 
the sale of their stakes in KorAm.

Carlyle bought the 36.6 percent stake in KorAm for 489 billion won ($422 million) or 6,800 won per share in 
November 2000, and its value had reached more than 1.2 trillion won as of Monday. KorAm's stock closed at 
15,800 won on Friday. 
Standard Chartered bought the 9.76 percent stake for 108 billion won from Samsung Group in August last year, 
and its capital gains amounted to more than 115 billion won.

Citybank's likely purchase of KorAm Bank is expected to cause a major change of atmosphere in the domestic 
finance world. Observers are afraid that with Citibank's capital and KorAm's branch network, if the bank were to 
begin offering full commercial banking services, weaker domestic banks would not be able to handle the shock. 
¡^XDF Citibank about to take over KorAm Citibank got in a takeover battle at the end of 2003, but with the new 
year changed strategies, deciding instead to work on acquiring KorAm from Citibank's New York City 
headquarters. Rumor has it that KorAm's president and former Citibank official Heo Yeong-gu played an 
important role in this process. Citibank is in the final stages of negotiating the purchase KorAm shares owned by 
the Carlyle Group (38.6%) and Standard Chartered Bank (9.76%). It's strategy is reportedly to then engage in a 
takeover bid on between 10 to 20 percent to secure 60+ percent shares of KorAm. 
One official said Citibank always secures 67 percent of a financial company it is purchasing. Shares are expected 
to sell at around W17,000, given the current price of approximately 15,000 and management premium. ¡^XDF 
Tectonic shift in Korean financeCitibank's move is being seen as part of the head office's global market expansion 
strategy, which has been pursued since Charles Prince was installed as chairman and CEO in October of last 
year. In a recent interview with the Chosun Ilbo, Kookmin Bank CEO Kim Jung-tae said, "if Citibank were to take 
over one domestic commercial bank, it would be a bigger threat to Kookmin than a merge with several of those 
banks." Observers predict that if Citibank does decide to engage the domestic market in full, it will probably 
concentrate on retail banking. The bank opened its first office in Seoul in 1967, so it has to be assumed that it has 
done more than enough market analysis. "Citibank will go after the top 20 percent of financial customers," said 
one analyst. "It will be a power to behold when Citibank's 12 Korean branches and KorAm's 225
