GENEVA, April 7 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble is looking for acquisitions but does
not want to fuel growth via hostile takeovers, Chairman and Chief Executive Alan Lafley said on Monday.
He declined comment when asked if the maker of consumer products including Pringles crisps, Crest toothpaste
and Pampers nappies would be interested in acquiring German consumer goods firm Beiersdorf, which makes
Nivea skin products.
German insurer Allianz AG is looking to sell its 44 percent stake in Beiersdorf.
"I cannot comment on Beiersdorf, but I will remind you that acquisitions are part of our growth strategy. But they
must be strategic and they must fit culturally. We are not an unfriendly takeover company and we are very
patient," he said.
"We are not aggressive...because we want a strong corporate culture," said Lafley, who was speaking at a
Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce event.
Last week, Beiersdorf shares surged on talk that Anglo-Dutch group Unilever was poised to make a bid. Under
Germany's takeover law, a buyer would have to make an offer for the entire company.
P&G has long been a rumoured buyer and was in talks last year with Allianz about the Beiersdorf stake.
However they could not agree on price and the U.S. firm was unable to convince family-owned coffee group
Tchibo, which holds 30 percent of Beiersdrof, to sell.
Last month P&G bought German health care group Wella in a deal worth 6.5 billion euros and which Lafley said
showed just how patient P&G can be. The firm had been eyeing Wella since the 1980s, he said.
Buying Beiersdorf would help P&G, maker of Oil of Olay, close the gap on France's L'Oreal in the skin care
market and reinforce its business in western Europe, where it has not been growing as fast as it would like.
But Lafley played down the importance of overtaking L'Oreal any time soon.
"The way we think about things is much more long term. We think in terms of 100 years and not quarters," he
said. "We like beauty and healthcare because the demographics will continue to drive growth. We're thinking
about a beauty and personal care business which will be a leader in 2025 or 2050."
In the meantime, he said, there was "plenty of room" in the market for both Loreal and P&G.

BERLIN -(Dow Jones)- Procter & Gamble Co.'s (PG) takeover of German haircare products maker Wella AG
(G.WEL) will generate synergies mainly through economics of scale, P&G CEO Alan Lafley told Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview, adding however that there surely will be overlaps between the two business.
P&G has promised synergies of EUR300 million from the third year onwards.

SPECULATION is growing that consumer products giant Procter & Gamble will mount a takeover bid for German
hair-care products maker Wella.
P&G yesterday issued a Press release ostensibly to report an improved quarterly profit outlook. But an invitation
to analysts from any firm to attend a presentation at a Merrill Lynch investors' conference today with chief
executive Alan Lafley has raised the prospect that P&G may announce an acquisition. Firms hosting
conferences do not usually invite analysts from rival firms.
"The last time an impromptu meeting was called by P&G the Clairol acquisition was announced," said Ann Gillin
Lefever, an analyst at Lehman Brothers.
Simon Burton, an analyst at Banc of America Capital Management, said: "I would say that I expect Procter is
going to make an announcement and it's very possible that it's related to an acquisition."
Many analysts believe the target could be Wella. P&G said recently that hair care is one of the four core areas it
is looking to expand in, and Wella is already in play with Unilever believed to be interested and German rival
Henkel last week buying 7% of the company.
P&G declined to comment on a possible deal or to comment on the nature of today's meeting.
P&G yesterday raised its outlook for the third quarter ending in March. It now expects earnings to rise by 13% to
14%, up from its forecast made in January of 11% to 13% growth.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
FRANKFURT -(Dow Jones)- Branded goods company Henkel KGaA (G.HEN) accumulated a 6.86% stake in
Wella AG (G.WEL), creating a poison pill for any potential rival bidder for the hair-care company.
The Duesseldorf-based owner of Duck-brand tape, Persil washing powder, Pritt Stick and Loctite Superglue
brands, disclosed the stake late Monday and said Tuesday that it purchased it because the price was right.
Analysts, however, see the purchase as a crafty move to thwart a bid for Wella from U.S.-rival Procter & Gamble
(PG).
Many market participants didn't welcome the prospect of a bidding war between Henkel and P&G. Around 1640
GMT, Henkel's ordinary shares were trading down 7.6% at EUR45.10 and preferred shares were off 8.2% at
EUR51.60. Wella's ordinary shares were up 5.13% at EUR76.80, while preferred shares rose 1.82% to
EUR62.10.
Henkel said it bought 2,206,414 common as well as 2,2428,100 preferred shares in Darmstadt-based Wella
through a subsidiary. Although Henkel didn't disclose the purchase price, WGZ bank analyst Bernd Schnarr said
Henkel spent around EUR309 million for the stake.
Henkel wouldn't comment on whether the move was part of a poison pill strategy. In a statement, it said that
"Henkel sees this as an interesting investment in view of the current climate on the stock market."
Even if that were the case, Schnarr said, "buying the stake is a way of making a takeover much more difficult for
other potential bidders, or it could be a first step toward an outright takeover."
Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein also rejected Henkel's explanation as insufficient and saw the move as an
attempt to block a rival bid. "Henkel now has a poison pill for any (Wella) buyer," it said in a research note.
"If it's such a good time to buy shares, why aren't they buying back their own," another analyst said.
Takeover rumors regarding Wella lifted ordinary shares to above EUR75 Tuesday from EUR58 a week ago after
reports that P&G had made an offer for Wella, which was said to be worth about EUR5.5 billion to EUR6.5 billion.
Wella and P&G declined to comment at the time. But Alan Lafley, CEO of P&G, has in the past expressed
interest in expanding the company's market share in health and beauty care.
"We have no comment regarding this matter," P&G spokesman Andrew Fisk said Tuesday. P&G also declined to
comment on whether it would counter any bid from Henkel.
Through buying 4.99% of common shares and 10.38% of preferred nonvoting shares, Henkel can make a
takeover much more expensive for rival bidders. Under German law, a potential bidder needs to acquire more
than 95% of a company to squeeze out other shareholders. "With Henkel holding 6.86%, this is no longer
possible," Schnarr added.
Stroeher Family Members Hold Major Stake
Page 6 of 10 © 2013 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
So far, a takeover bid for Wella, which has a market capitalization of EUR4.03 billion, has been prevented
because of objections from members of the Stroeher family, which controls 78% of ordinary shares through
complex family shareholdings.
Henkel issued statements inviting analysts to believe it had acquired the Wella stake from a single source,
possibly a member of the Stroeher family.
"We were offered the Wella stake from a third party and have acquired the stake over a period of time," Henkel
spokesman Sven Jacobsen said. So far, outside firms have been unable to persuade Stroeher family members to
relinquish control.
But analysts remain skeptical about the origins of the stake since Henkel declined to divulge the identity of the
seller, the price of the acquisition, or name the unit through which the stake was acquired.
Henkel is more likely to have bought the shares on the market, according to DrKW. "We don't believe the shares
were purchased from the Stroeher family or a big shareholder," it said in a note.
A representative of the Stroeher family couldn't be reached for comment.
Wella spokeswoman Birgit Klesper couldn't shed further light on the matter, saying, "We only know about the
purchase from statements made by Henkel."
Henkel already made one unsuccessful informal bid for Wella in the past 18 months, analysts said. Henkel
declined comment on the matter. Wella's spokeswoman Birgit Klesper said the offer would have gone to the
descendants of founder Franz Stroeher. "I can't speak for them, but no offer was made to the company."
Henkel declined to comment directly about whether it intends to increase its stake in Wella but said, "We will
expand organically and through acquisitions, providing we see a strategic fit and an appropriate price can be
agreed upon."
Should Wella's controlling shareholders consent to a sale, Henkel could raise up to EUR2.5 billion for an
acquisition without having to resort to a capital increase or asset sales. With the disposal of stakes in units such
as Clorox and Ecolab, and asset sales, Henkel could raise between EUR6 billion and EUR6.5 billion, analysts
say.
"We can go up to EUR2.5 billion without asset sales or without a capital increase," Henkel Chief Financial Officer
Jochen Krautter told journalists at a Duesseldorf conference last week. "I see expansion by organic growth and
acquisitions as the right strategy," he said.
Henkel last week said it plans to expand its personal care unit, which posted EUR184 million in earnings before
interest and taxes in 2001, and will focus on expanding its market share in hair, skin and body-care products.

Procter & Gamble (P&G) wants to expand its range of body- health- and beauty-care products--a sector in which
its annual sales currently reach almost $15bn a year.
Interviewed by a Paris-based paper, P&G President Alan Lafley said the company was still a relatively small
player in these very rapidly growing markets. He said the company had between $8bn and $10bn accumulated in
the past two years and now available for acquisitions. The background aim was an increase in annual sales of
4%-6% with 2% coming from the natural progression of markets.
As far as care products were concerned, acquisitions had been made because they were both logical and
complementary. They were in the shampoo sector, for example, and so had taken over Clairol because it was the
quickest and most effective way to enter the hair colouring market.
Asked about the possible acquisition of Wella AG, Lafley said P&G wanted to develop the haircare market and
one preoccupation was to reinforce its position in Europe where it was still relatively weak. He said he did not
want to comment on any particular issue and he had seen Wella had rejected an offer from Henkel and would
now wait to see what Wella wanted to do.
On the Beiersdorf-Nivea acquisition saga, Lafley said an acquisition was only of interest to P&G if it was of
strategic significance in the development of long-term brands. Lafley also said in relation to the perfumes
segment that his company was seeking brands which were under-exploited commercially and which had the
potential to become classics.
